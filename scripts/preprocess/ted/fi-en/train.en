I was speaking to a group of about 300 kids , ages six to eight , at a children &apos;s museum , and I brought with me a bag full of legs , similar to the kinds of things you see up here , and had them laid out on a table for the kids .
And , from my experience , you know , kids are naturally curious about what they don &apos;t know , or don &apos;t understand , or is foreign to them .
They only learn to be frightened of those differences when an adult influences them to behave that way , and maybe censors that natural curiosity , or you know , reins in the question-asking in the hopes of them being polite little kids .
So I just pictured a first grade teacher out in the lobby with these unruly kids , saying , &quot; &quot; Now , whatever you do , don &apos;t stare at her legs . &quot; &quot; But , of course , that &apos;s the point .
That &apos;s why I was there , I wanted to invite them to look and explore .
So I made a deal with the adults that the kids could come in without any adults for two minutes on their own .
The doors open , the kids descend on this table of legs , and they are poking and prodding , and they &apos;re wiggling toes , and they &apos;re trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg to see what happens with that .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Kids , really quickly — I woke up this morning , I decided I wanted to be able to jump over a house — nothing too big , two or three stories — but , if you could think of any animal , any superhero , any cartoon character , anything you can dream up right now , what kind of legs would you build me ? &quot; &quot; And immediately a voice shouted , &quot; &quot; Kangaroo ! &quot; &quot; &quot; No , no , no ! Should be a frog ! &quot;
&quot; No . It should be Go Go Gadget ! &quot;
&quot; No , no , no ! It should be the Incredibles . &quot;
And other things that I don &apos;t — aren &apos;t familiar with .
And then , one eight-year-old said , &quot; Hey , why wouldn &apos;t you want to fly too ? &quot;
And the whole room , including me , was like , &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And just like that , I went from being a woman that these kids would have been trained to see as &quot; &quot; disabled &quot; &quot; to somebody that had potential that their bodies didn &apos;t have yet .
Somebody that might even be super-abled .
Interesting .
So some of you actually saw me at TED , 11 years ago .
And there &apos;s been a lot of talk about how life-changing this conference is for both speakers and attendees , and I am no exception .
TED literally was the launch pad to the next decade of my life &apos;s exploration .
At the time , the legs I presented were groundbreaking in prosthetics .
I had woven carbon fiber sprinting legs modeled after the hind leg of a cheetah , which you may have seen on stage yesterday .
And also these very life-like , intrinsically painted silicone legs .
So at the time , it was my opportunity to put a call out to innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community to come bring their talent to the science and to the art of building legs .
So that we can stop compartmentalizing form , function and aesthetic , and assigning them different values .
Well , lucky for me , a lot of people answered that call .
And the journey started , funny enough , with a TED conference attendee — Chee Pearlman , who hopefully is in the audience somewhere today .
She was the editor then of a magazine called ID , and she gave me a cover story .
This started an incredible journey .
Curious encounters were happening to me at the time ; I &apos;d been accepting numerous invitations to speak on the design of the cheetah legs around the world .
And people would come up to me after the conference , after my talk , men and women .
And the conversation would go something like this , &quot; &quot; You know Aimee , you &apos;re very attractive .
You don &apos;t look disabled . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s amazing , because I don &apos;t feel disabled . &quot; &quot; And it really opened my eyes to this conversation that could be explored , about beauty .
What does a beautiful woman have to look like ?
What is a sexy body ?
And interestingly , from an identity standpoint , what does it mean to have a disability ?
I mean , people — Pamela Anderson has more prosthetic in her body than I do .
Nobody calls her disabled .
( Laughter ) So this magazine , through the hands of graphic designer Peter Saville , went to fashion designer Alexander McQueen , and photographer Nick Knight , who were also interested in exploring that conversation .
So , three months after TED I found myself on a plane to London , doing my first fashion shoot , which resulted in this cover — &quot; &quot; Fashion-able &quot; &quot; ?
Three months after that , I did my first runway show for Alexander McQueen on a pair of hand-carved wooden legs made from solid ash .
Nobody knew — everyone thought they were wooden boots .
Actually , I have them on stage with me : grapevines , magnolias — truly stunning .
Poetry matters .
Poetry is what elevates the banal and neglected object to a realm of art .
It can transform the thing that might have made people fearful into something that invites them to look , and look a little longer , and maybe even understand .
I learned this firsthand with my next adventure .
The artist Matthew Barney , in his film opus called the &quot; &quot; The Cremaster Cycle . &quot; &quot; This is where it really hit home for me — that my legs could be wearable sculpture .
And even at this point , I started to move away from the need to replicate human-ness as the only aesthetic ideal .
So we made what people lovingly referred to as glass legs even though they &apos;re actually optically clear polyurethane , a.k.a. bowling ball material .
Heavy !
Then we made these legs that are cast in soil with a potato root system growing in them , and beetroots out the top , and a very lovely brass toe .
That &apos;s a good close-up of that one .
Then another character was a half-woman , half-cheetah — a little homage to my life as an athlete .
14 hours of prosthetic make-up to get into a creature that had articulated paws , claws and a tail that whipped around , like a gecko .
( Laughter ) And then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these — look like jellyfish legs , also polyurethane .
And the only purpose that these legs can serve , outside the context of the film , is to provoke the senses and ignite the imagination .
So whimsy matters .
Today , I have over a dozen pair of prosthetic legs that various people have made for me , and with them I have different negotiations of the terrain under my feet , and I can change my height — I have a variable of five different heights .
( Laughter ) Today , I &apos;m 6 &apos; 1 &quot; &quot; .
And I had these legs made a little over a year ago at Dorset Orthopedic in England and when I brought them home to Manhattan , my first night out on the town , I went to a very fancy party .
And a girl was there who has known me for years at my normal 5 &apos; 8 &quot; &quot; .
Her mouth dropped open when she saw me , and she went , &quot; &quot; But you &apos;re so tall ! &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I know . Isn &apos;t it fun ? &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s a little bit like wearing stilts on stilts , but I have an entirely new relationship to door jams that I never expected I would ever have .
And I was having fun with it .
And she looked at me , and she said , &quot; &quot; But , Aimee , that &apos;s not fair . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And the incredible thing was she really meant it .
It &apos;s not fair that you can change your height , as you want it .
And that &apos;s when I knew — that &apos;s when I knew that the conversation with society has changed profoundly in this last decade .
It is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency .
It &apos;s a conversation about augmentation .
It &apos;s a conversation about potential .
A prosthetic limb doesn &apos;t represent the need to replace loss anymore .
It can stand as a symbol that the wearer has the power to create whatever it is that they want to create in that space .
So people that society once considered to be disabled can now become the architects of their own identities and indeed continue to change those identities by designing their bodies from a place of empowerment .
And what is exciting to me so much right now is that by combining cutting-edge technology — robotics , bionics — with the age-old poetry , we are moving closer to understanding our collective humanity .
I think that if we want to discover the full potential in our humanity , we need to celebrate those heartbreaking strengths and those glorious disabilities that we all have .
I think of Shakespeare &apos;s Shylock : &quot; &quot; If you prick us , do we not bleed , and if you tickle us , do we not laugh ? &quot; &quot; It is our humanity , and all the potential within it , that makes us beautiful .
Thank you .

We see with the eyes , but we see with the brain as well .
And seeing with the brain is often called imagination .
And we are familiar with the landscapes of our own imagination , our inscapes . We &apos;ve lived with them all our lives .
But there are also hallucinations as well , and hallucinations are completely different .
They don &apos;t seem to be of our creation .
They don &apos;t seem to be under our control .
They seem to come from the outside , and to mimic perception .
So I am going to be talking about hallucinations , and a particular sort of visual hallucination which I see among my patients .
A few months ago , I got a phone call from a nursing home where I work .
They told me that one of their residents , an old lady in her 90s , was seeing things , and they wondered if she &apos;d gone bonkers or , because she was an old lady , whether she &apos;d had a stroke , or whether she had Alzheimer &apos;s .
And so they asked me if I would come and see Rosalie , the old lady .
I went in to see her .
It was evident straight away that she was perfectly sane and lucid and of good intelligence , but she &apos;d been very startled and very bewildered , because she &apos;d been seeing things .
And she told me — the nurses hadn &apos;t mentioned this — that she was blind , that she had been completely blind from macular degeneration for five years .
But now , for the last few days , she &apos;d been seeing things .
So I said , &quot; &quot; What sort of things ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; People in Eastern dress , in drapes , walking up and down stairs .
A man who turns towards me and smiles .
But he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth .
Animals too .
I see a white building . It &apos;s snowing , a soft snow .
I see this horse with a harness , dragging the snow away .
Then , one night , the scene changes .
I see cats and dogs walking towards me .
They come to a certain point and then stop .
Then it changes again .
I see a lot of children . They are walking up and down stairs .
They wear bright colors , rose and blue , like Eastern dress . &quot; &quot; Sometimes , she said , before the people come on , she may hallucinate pink and blue squares on the floor , which seem to go up to the ceiling .
I said , &quot; &quot; Is this like a dream ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; No , it &apos;s not like a dream . It &apos;s like a movie . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s got color . It &apos;s got motion .
But it &apos;s completely silent , like a silent movie . &quot; &quot; And she said that it &apos;s a rather boring movie .
She said , &quot; &quot; All these people with Eastern dress , walking up and down , very repetitive , very limited . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And she has a sense of humor .
She knew it was a hallucination .
But she was frightened . She &apos;d lived 95 years and she &apos;d never had a hallucination before .
She said that the hallucinations were unrelated to anything she was thinking or feeling or doing , that they seemed to come on by themselves , or disappear .
She had no control over them .
She said she didn &apos;t recognize any of the people or places in the hallucinations .
And none of the people or the animals , well , they all seemed oblivious of her .
And she didn &apos;t know what was going on .
She wondered if she was going mad or losing her mind .
Well , I examined her carefully .
She was a bright old lady , perfectly sane . She had no medical problems .
She wasn &apos;t on any medications which could produce hallucinations .
But she was blind .
And I then said to her , &quot; I think I know what you have . &quot;
I said , &quot; &quot; There is a special form of visual hallucination which may go with deteriorating vision or blindness .
This was originally described , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; right back in the 18th century , by a man called Charles Bonnet .
And you have Charles Bonnet syndrome .
There is nothing wrong with your brain . There is nothing wrong with your mind .
You have Charles Bonnet syndrome . &quot; &quot; And she was very relieved at this , that there was nothing seriously the matter , and also rather curious .
She said , &quot; &quot; Who is this Charles Bonnet ? &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; Did he have them himself ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; Tell all the nurses that I have Charles Bonnet syndrome . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; I &apos;m not crazy . I &apos;m not demented . I have Charles Bonnet syndrome . &quot;
Well , so I did tell the nurses .
Now this , for me , is a common situation .
I work in old-age homes , largely .
I see a lot of elderly people who are hearing impaired or visually impaired .
About 10 percent of the hearing impaired people get musical hallucinations .
And about 10 percent of the visually impaired people get visual hallucinations .
You don &apos;t have to be completely blind , only sufficiently impaired .
Now with the original description in the 18th century , Charles Bonnet did not have them .
His grandfather had these hallucinations .
His grandfather was a magistrate , an elderly man .
He &apos;d had cataract surgery .
His vision was pretty poor .
And in 1759 , he described to his grandson various things he was seeing .
The first thing he said was he saw a handkerchief in midair .
It was a large blue handkerchief with four orange circles .
And he knew it was a hallucination .
You don &apos;t have handkerchiefs in midair .
And then he saw a big wheel in midair .
But sometimes he wasn &apos;t sure whether he was hallucinating or not , because the hallucinations would fit in the context of the visions .
So on one occasion , when his granddaughters were visiting them , he said , &quot; &quot; And who are these handsome young men with you ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Alas , Grandpapa , there are no handsome young men . &quot; &quot; And then the handsome young men disappeared .
It &apos;s typical of these hallucinations that they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash .
They don &apos;t usually fade in and out .
They are rather sudden , and they change suddenly .
Charles Lullin , the grandfather , saw hundreds of different figures , different landscapes of all sorts .
On one occasion , he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe , and realized it was himself .
That was the only figure he recognized .
On one occasion when he was walking in the streets of Paris , he saw — this was real — a scaffolding .
But when he got back home , he saw a miniature of the scaffolding six inches high , on his study table .
This repetition of perception is sometimes called palinopsia .
With him and with Rosalie , what seems to be going on — and Rosalie said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; — and I said that as you lose vision , as the visual parts of the brain are no longer getting any input , they become hyperactive and excitable , and they start to fire spontaneously .
And you start to see things .
The things you see can be very complicated indeed .
With another patient of mine , who , also had some vision , the vision she had could be disturbing .
On one occasion , she said she saw a man in a striped shirt in a restaurant .
And he turned around . And then he divided into six figures in striped shirts , who started walking towards her .
And then the six figures came together again , like a concertina .
Once , when she was driving , or rather , her husband was driving , the road divided into four and she felt herself going simultaneously up four roads .
She had very mobile hallucinations as well .
A lot of them had to do with a car .
Sometimes she would see a teenage boy sitting on the hood of the car .
He was very tenacious and he moved rather gracefully when the car turned .
And then when they came to a stop , the boy would do a sudden vertical takeoff , 100 foot in the air , and then disappear .
Another patient of mine had a different sort of hallucination .
This was a woman who didn &apos;t have trouble with her eyes , but the visual parts of her brain , a little tumor in the occipital cortex .
And , above all , she would see cartoons .
These cartoons would be transparent and would cover half the visual field , like a screen .
And especially she saw cartoons of Kermit the Frog .
( Laughter ) Now , I don &apos;t watch Sesame Street , but she made a point of saying , &quot; &quot; Why Kermit ? &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; Kermit the Frog means nothing to me .
You know , I was wondering about Freudian determinants .
Why Kermit ?
Kermit the Frog means nothing to me . &quot; &quot; She didn &apos;t mind the cartoons too much .
But what did disturb her was she got very persistent images or hallucinations of faces and as with Rosalie , the faces were often deformed , with very large teeth or very large eyes .
And these frightened her .
Well , what is going on with these people ?
As a physician , I have to try and define what &apos;s going on , and to reassure people , especially to reassure them that they &apos;re not going insane .
Something like 10 percent , as I said , of visually impaired people get these .
But no more than one percent of the people acknowledge them , because they are afraid they will be seen as insane or something .
And if they do mention them to their own doctors they may be misdiagnosed .
In particular , the notion is that if you see things or hear things , you &apos;re going mad , but the psychotic hallucinations are quite different .
Psychotic hallucinations , whether they are visual or vocal , they address you . They accuse you .
They seduce you . They humiliate you .
They jeer at you .
You interact with them .
There is none of this quality of being addressed with these Charles Bonnet hallucinations .
There is a film . You &apos;re seeing a film which has nothing to do with you , or that &apos;s how people think about it .
There is also a rare thing called temporal lobe epilepsy , and sometimes , if one has this , one may feel oneself transported back to a time and place in the past .
You &apos;re at a particular road junction .
You smell chestnuts roasting .
You hear the traffic . All the senses are involved .
And you &apos;re waiting for your girl .
And it &apos;s that Tuesday evening back in 1982 .
And the temporal lobe hallucinations are all-sense hallucinations , full of feeling , full of familiarity , located in space and time , coherent , dramatic .
The Charles Bonnet ones are quite different .
So in the Charles Bonnet hallucinations , you have all sorts of levels , from the geometrical hallucinations — the pink and blue squares the woman had — up to quite elaborate hallucinations with figures and especially faces .
Faces , and sometimes deformed faces , are the single commonest thing in these hallucinations .
And one of the second commonest is cartoons .
So , what is going on ?
Fascinatingly , in the last few years , it &apos;s been possible to do functional brain imagery , to do fMRI on people as they are hallucinating .
And in fact , to find that different parts of the visual brain are activated as they are hallucinating .
When people have these simple geometrical hallucinations , the primary visual cortex is activated .
This is the part of the brain which perceives edges and patterns .
You don &apos;t form images with your primary visual cortex .
When images are formed , a higher part of the visual cortex is involved in the temporal lobe .
And in particular , one area of the temporal lobe is called the fusiform gyrus .
And it &apos;s known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus , they maybe lose the ability to recognize faces .
But if there is an abnormal activity in the fusiform gyrus , they may hallucinate faces , and this is exactly what you find in some of these people .
There is an area in the anterior part of this gyrus where teeth and eyes are represented , and that part of the gyrus is activated when people get the deformed hallucinations .
There is another part of the brain which is especially activated when one sees cartoons .
It &apos;s activated when one recognizes cartoons , when one draws cartoons , and when one hallucinates them .
It &apos;s very interesting that that should be specific .
There are other parts of the brain which are specifically involved with the recognition and hallucination of buildings and landscapes .
Around 1970 , it was found that there were not only parts of the brain , but particular cells .
&quot; &quot; Face cells &quot; &quot; were discovered around 1970 .
And now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells , which can be very , very specific .
So you may not only have &quot; &quot; car &quot; &quot; cells , you may have &quot; &quot; Aston Martin &quot; &quot; cells .
( Laughter ) I saw an Aston Martin this morning .
I had to bring it in .
And now it &apos;s in there somewhere .
( Laughter ) Now , at this level , in what &apos;s called the inferotemporal cortex , there are only visual images , or figments or fragments .
It &apos;s only at higher levels that the other senses join in and there are connections with memory and emotion .
And in the Charles Bonnet syndrome , you don &apos;t go to those higher levels .
You &apos;re in these levels of inferior visual cortex where you have thousands and tens of thousands and millions of images , or figments , or fragmentary figments , all neurally encoded in particular cells or small clusters of cells .
Normally these are all part of the integrated stream of perception , or imagination , and one is not conscious of them .
It is only if one is visually impaired or blind that the process is interrupted .
And instead of getting normal perception , you &apos;re getting an anarchic , convulsive stimulation , or release , of all of these visual cells in the inferotemporal cortex .
So , suddenly you see a face . Suddenly you see a car .
Suddenly this , and suddenly that .
The mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this , but not terribly successfully .
When these were first described , it was thought that they could be interpreted like dreams .
But in fact people say , &quot; I don &apos;t recognize the people . I can &apos;t form any associations . &quot;
&quot; Kermit means nothing to me . &quot;
You don &apos;t get anywhere thinking of them as dreams .
Well , I &apos;ve more or less said what I wanted .
I think I just want to recapitulate and say this is common .
Think of the number of blind people .
There must be hundreds of thousands of blind people who have these hallucinations , but are too scared to mention them .
So this sort of thing needs to be brought into notice , for patients , for doctors , for the public .
Finally , I think they are infinitely interesting and valuable , for giving one some insight as to how the brain works .
Charles Bonnet said , 250 years ago — he wondered how , thinking these hallucinations , how , as he put it , the theater of the mind could be generated by the machinery of the brain .
Now , 250 years later , I think we &apos;re beginning to glimpse how this is done .
Thanks very much .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : That was superb . Thank you so much .
You speak about these things with so much insight and empathy for your patients .
Have you yourself experienced any of the syndromes you write about ?
Oliver Sacks : I was afraid you &apos;d ask that .
( Laughter ) Well , yeah , a lot of them .
And actually I &apos;m a little visually impaired myself .
I &apos;m blind in one eye , and not terribly good in the other .
And I see the geometrical hallucinations .
But they stop there .
CA : And they don &apos;t disturb you ?
Because you understand what &apos;s doing it , it doesn &apos;t make you worried ?
OS : Well they don &apos;t disturb me any more than my tinnitus , which I ignore .
They occasionally interest me , and I have many pictures of them in my notebooks .
I &apos;ve gone and had an fMRI myself , to see how my visual cortex is taking over .
And when I see all these hexagons and complex things , which I also have , in visual migraine , I wonder whether everyone sees things like this , and whether things like cave art or ornamental art may have been derived from them a bit .
CA : That was an utterly , utterly fascinating talk .
Thank you so much for sharing .
OS : Thank you . Thank you .
( Applause )
And you don &apos;t have sex .
So when I do my job , people hate me .
In fact , the better I do my job , the more people hate me .
And no , I &apos;m not a meter maid , and I &apos;m not an undertaker .
I am a progressive lesbian talking head on Fox News . ( Applause ) So y &apos;all heard that , right ? Just to make sure , right ?
I am a gay talking head on Fox News .
I am going to tell you how I do it and the most important thing I &apos;ve learned .
So I go on television .
I debate people who literally want to obliterate everything I believe in , in some cases , who don &apos;t want me and people like me to even exist .
It &apos;s sort of like Thanksgiving with your conservative uncle on steroids , with a live television audience of millions .
It &apos;s totally almost just like that .
And that &apos;s just on air .
The hate mail I get is unbelievable .
Last week alone , I got 238 pieces of nasty email and more hate tweets than I can even count .
I was called an idiot , a traitor , a scourge , a cunt , and an ugly man , and that was just in one email .
( Laughter ) So what have I realized , being on the receiving end of all this ugliness ?
Well , my biggest takeaway is that for decades , we &apos;ve been focused on political correctness , but what matters more is emotional correctness .
Let me give you a small example .
I don &apos;t care if you call me a dyke . I really don &apos;t .
I care about two things .
One , I care that you spell it right .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Just quick refresher , it &apos;s D-Y-K-E .
You &apos;d totally be surprised .
And second , I don &apos;t care about the word , I care about how you use it .
Are you being friendly ? Are you just being naive ?
Or do you really want to hurt me personally ?
Emotional correctness is the tone , the feeling , how we say what we say , the respect and compassion we show one another .
And what I &apos;ve realized is that political persuasion doesn &apos;t begin with ideas or facts or data .
Political persuasion begins with being emotionally correct .
So when I first went to go work at Fox News , true confession , I expected there to be marks in the carpet from all the knuckle-dragging .
That , by the way , in case you &apos;re paying attention , is not emotionally correct .
But liberals on my side , we can be self-righteous , we can be condescending , we can be dismissive of anyone who doesn &apos;t agree with us .
In other words , we can be politically right but emotionally wrong .
And incidentally , that means that people don &apos;t like us . Right ?
Now here &apos;s the kicker .
Conservatives are really nice .
I mean , not all of them , and not the ones who send me hate mail , but you would be surprised .
Sean Hannity is one of the sweetest guys I &apos;ve ever met .
He spends his free time trying to fix up his staff on blind dates , and I know that if I ever had a problem , he would do anything he could to help .
Now , I think Sean Hannity is 99 percent politically wrong , but his emotional correctness is strikingly impressive , and that &apos;s why people listen to him .
Because you can &apos;t get anyone to agree with you if they don &apos;t even listen to you first .
We spend so much time talking past each other and not enough time talking through our disagreements , and if we can start to find compassion for one another , then we have a shot at building common ground .
It actually sounds really hokey to say it standing up here , but when you try to put it in practice , it &apos;s really powerful .
So someone who says they hate immigrants , I try to imagine how scared they must be that their community is changing from what they &apos;ve always known .
Or someone who says they don &apos;t like teachers &apos; unions , I bet they &apos;re really devastated to see their kid &apos;s school going into the gutter , and they &apos;re just looking for someone to blame .
Our challenge is to find the compassion for others that we want them to have for us .
That is emotional correctness .
I &apos;m not saying it &apos;s easy .
An average of , like , 5.6 times per day I have to stop myself from responding to all of my hate mail with a flurry of vile profanities .
This whole finding compassion and common ground with your enemies thing is kind of like a political-spiritual practice for me , and I ain &apos;t the Dalai Lama .
I &apos;m not perfect , but what I am is optimistic , because I don &apos;t just get hate mail .
I get a lot of really nice letters , lots of them .
And one of my all-time favorites begins , &quot; &quot; I am not a big fan of your political leanings or your sometimes tortured logic , but I &apos;m a big fan of you as a person . &quot; &quot; Now this guy doesn &apos;t agree with me , yet .
( Laughter ) But he &apos;s listening , not because of what I said , but because of how I said it , and somehow , even though we &apos;ve never met , we &apos;ve managed to form a connection .
That &apos;s emotional correctness , and that &apos;s how we start the conversations that really lead to change .
Thank you .

Growing up in Taiwan as the daughter of a calligrapher , one of my most treasured memories was my mother showing me the beauty , the shape and the form of Chinese characters .
Ever since then , I was fascinated by this incredible language .
But to an outsider , it seems to be as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China .
Over the past few years , I &apos;ve been wondering if I can break down this wall , so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so .
I started thinking about how a new , fast method of learning Chinese might be useful .
Since the age of five , I started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence .
I learned new characters every day during the course of the next 15 years .
Since we only have five minutes , it &apos;s better that we have a fast and simpler way .
A Chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters .
You only need 1,000 to understand the basic literacy .
The top 200 will allow you to comprehend 40 percent of basic literature — enough to read road signs , restaurant menus , to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers .
Today I &apos;m going to start with eight to show you how the method works .
You are ready ?
Open your mouth as wide as possible until it &apos;s square .
You get a mouth .
This is a person going for a walk .
Person .
If the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides , as if she was yelling frantically , &quot; &quot; Help ! I &apos;m on fire ! &quot; &quot; — This symbol actually is originally from the shape of the flame , but I like to think that way . Whichever works for you .
This is a tree .
Tree .
This is a mountain .
The sun .
The moon .
The symbol of the door looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west .
I call these eight characters radicals .
They are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters .
A person .
If someone walks behind , that is &quot; &quot; to follow . &quot; &quot; As the old saying goes , two is company , three is a crowd .
If a person stretched their arms wide , this person is saying , &quot; &quot; It was this big . &quot; &quot; The person inside the mouth , the person is trapped .
He &apos;s a prisoner , just like Jonah inside the whale .
One tree is a tree . Two trees together , we have the woods .
Three trees together , we create the forest .
Put a plank underneath the tree , we have the foundation .
Put a mouth on the top of the tree , that &apos;s &quot; &quot; idiot . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Easy to remember , since a talking tree is pretty idiotic .
Remember fire ?
Two fires together , I get really hot .
Three fires together , that &apos;s a lot of flames .
Set the fire underneath the two trees , it &apos;s burning .
For us , the sun is the source of prosperity .
Two suns together , prosperous .
Three together , that &apos;s sparkles .
Put the sun and the moon shining together , it &apos;s brightness .
It also means tomorrow , after a day and a night .
The sun is coming up above the horizon . Sunrise .
A door . Put a plank inside the door , it &apos;s a door bolt .
Put a mouth inside the door , asking questions .
Knock knock . Is anyone home ?
This person is sneaking out of a door , escaping , evading .
On the left , we have a woman .
Two women together , they have an argument .
( Laughter ) Three women together , be careful , it &apos;s adultery .
So we have gone through almost 30 characters .
By using this method , the first eight radicals will allow you to build 32 .
The next group of eight characters will build an extra 32 .
So with very little effort , you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters , which is the same as a Chinese eight-year-old .
So after we know the characters , we start building phrases .
For example , the mountain and the fire together , we have fire mountain . It &apos;s a volcano .
We know Japan is the land of the rising sun .
This is a sun placed with the origin , because Japan lies to the east of China .
So a sun , origin together , we build Japan .
A person behind Japan , what do we get ?
A Japanese person .
The character on the left is two mountains stacked on top of each other .
In ancient China , that means in exile , because Chinese emperors , they put their political enemies in exile beyond mountains .
Nowadays , exile has turned into getting out .
A mouth which tells you where to get out is an exit .
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and get off of the stage . Thank you .

I got a visit almost exactly a year ago , a little over a year ago , from a very senior person at the Department of Defense .
Came to see me and said , &quot; &quot; 1,600 of the kids that we &apos;ve sent out have come back missing at least one full arm .
Whole arm . Shoulder disarticulation .
And we &apos;re doing the same thing we did for — more or less , that we &apos;ve done since the Civil War , a stick and a hook .
And they deserve more than that . &quot; &quot; And literally , this guy sat in my office in New Hampshire and said , &quot; &quot; I want you to give me something that we can put on these kids that &apos;ll pick up a raisin or a grape off a table , they &apos;ll be able to put it in their mouth without destroying either one , and they &apos;ll be able to know the difference without looking at it . &quot; &quot; You know , had efferent , afferent , and haptic response .
He finishes explaining that , and I &apos;m waiting for the big 300 pound paper proposal , and he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what I want from you . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Look , you &apos;re nuts . That technology &apos;s just not available right now .
And it can &apos;t be done .
Not in an envelope of a human arm , with 21 degrees of freedom , from your shoulder to your fingertips . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; About two dozen of these 1,600 kids have come back bilateral .
You think it &apos;s bad to lose one arm ?
That &apos;s an inconvenience compared to having both of them gone . &quot; &quot; I got a day job , and my nights and weekends are already filled up with things like , let &apos;s supply water to the world , and power to the world , and educate all the kids , which , Chris , I will not talk about . I don &apos;t need another mission .
I keep thinking about these kids with no arms .
He says to me , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve done some work around the country .
We &apos;ve got some pretty amazing neurology and other people . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll take a field trip , I &apos;ll go see what you got . &quot; &quot; Over the next month I visited lots of places , some out here , around the country , found the best of the best .
I went down to Washington . I saw these guys , and said , &quot; &quot; I did what you asked me . I looked at what &apos;s out there .
I still think you &apos;re nuts . But not as nuts as I thought . &quot; &quot; I put a team together , a little over 13 months ago , got up to 20 some-odd people .
We said , we &apos;re going to build a device that does what he wants .
We have 14 out of the 21 degrees of freedom ; you don &apos;t need the ones in the last two fingers .
We put this thing together .
A couple of weeks ago we took it down to Walter Reed , which is unfortunately more in the news these days .
We showed it to a bunch of guys .
One guy who described himself as being lucky , because he lost his left arm , and he &apos;s a righty .
He sat at a table with seven or eight of these other guys .
Said he was lucky , because he had his good arm , and then he pushed himself back from the table . He had no legs .
These kids have attitudes that you just can &apos;t believe .
So I &apos;m going to show you now , without the skin on it , a 30-second piece , and then I &apos;m done .
But understand what you &apos;re looking at we made small enough to fit on a 50th percentile female , so that we could put it in any of these people .
It &apos;s going to go inside something that we use in CAT scans and MRIs of whatever is their good arm , to make silicon rubber , then coat it , and paint it in 3D — exact mirror image of their other limb .
So , you won &apos;t see all the really cool stuff that &apos;s in this series elastic set of 14 actuators , each one which has its own capability to sense temperature and pressure .
It also has a pneumatic cuff that holds it on , so the more they put themselves under load , the more it attaches .
They take the load off , and it becomes , again , compliant .
I &apos;m going to show you a guy doing a couple of simple things with this that we demonstrated in Washington . Can we look at this thing ?
Watch the fingers grab . The thumb comes up . Wrist .
This weighs 6.9 pounds .
Going to scratch his nose .
It &apos;s got 14 active degrees of freedom .
Now he &apos;s going to pick up a pen with his opposed thumb and index finger .
Now he &apos;s going to put that down , pick up a piece of paper , rotate all the degrees of freedom in his hand and wrist , and read it .

I &apos;ve noticed something interesting about society and culture .
For some reason , there &apos;s no standard syllabus , there &apos;s no basic course .
The space bar scrolls down one page .
You make the text larger with each tap .
Go space , space .
Double click the word .
Also , don &apos;t delete what you &apos;ve highlighted .
You can just type over it .
So I know I went super fast .
What I &apos;d like to start off with is an observation , which is that if I &apos;ve learned anything over the last year , it &apos;s that the supreme irony of publishing a book about slowness is that you have to go around promoting it really fast .
I seem to spend most of my time these days zipping from city to city , studio to studio , interview to interview , serving up the book in really tiny bite-size chunks .
Because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down , but they want to know how to slow down really quickly . So ...
so I did a spot on CNN the other day where I actually spent more time in makeup than I did talking on air .
And I think that — that &apos;s not really surprising though , is it ?
Because that &apos;s kind of the world that we live in now , a world stuck in fast-forward .
Every moment of the day feels like a race against the clock .
To borrow a phrase from Carrie Fisher , which is in my bio there ; I &apos;ll just toss it out again — &quot; &quot; These days even instant gratification takes too long . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And if you think about how we to try to make things better , what do we do ?
No , we speed them up , don &apos;t we ? So we used to dial ; now we speed dial .
We used to read ; now we speed read . We used to walk ; now we speed walk .
And of course , we used to date and now we speed date .
And even things that are by their very nature slow — we try and speed them up too .
So I was in New York recently , and I walked past a gym that had an advertisement in the window for a new course , a new evening course .
And it was for , you guessed it , speed yoga .
So this — the perfect solution for time-starved professionals who want to , you know , salute the sun , but only want to give over about 20 minutes to it .
I mean , these are sort of the extreme examples , and they &apos;re amusing and good to laugh at .
But there &apos;s a very serious point , and I think that in the headlong dash of daily life , we often lose sight of the damage that this roadrunner form of living does to us .
We &apos;re so marinated in the culture of speed that we almost fail to notice the toll it takes on every aspect of our lives — on our health , our diet , our work , our relationships , the environment and our community .
You know , a burnout , or eventually the body says , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t take it anymore , &quot; &quot; and throws in the towel .
Or maybe a relationship goes up in smoke because we haven &apos;t had the time , or the patience , or the tranquility , to be with the other person , to listen to them .
And my wake-up call came when I started reading bedtime stories to my son , and I found that at the end of day , I would go into his room and I just couldn &apos;t slow down — you know , I &apos;d be speed reading &quot; &quot; The Cat In The Hat . &quot; &quot; I &apos;d be — you know , I &apos;d be skipping lines here , paragraphs there , sometimes a whole page , and of course , my little boy knew the book inside out , so we would quarrel .
And what should have been the most relaxing , the most intimate , the most tender moment of the day , when a dad sits down to read to his son , became instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills , a clash between my speed and his slowness .
And this went on for some time , until I caught myself scanning a newspaper article with timesaving tips for fast people .
And one of them made reference to a series of books called &quot; The One-Minute Bedtime Story . &quot;
And I wince saying those words now , but my first reaction at the time was very different .
My first reflex was to say , &quot; &quot; Hallelujah — what a great idea !
This is exactly what I &apos;m looking for to speed up bedtime even more . &quot; &quot; But thankfully , a light bulb went on over my head , and my next reaction was very different , and I took a step back , and I thought , &quot; &quot; Whoa — you know , has it really come to this ?
I just thought , and I thought long and hard .
And by the time I got off that plane , I &apos;d decided I wanted to do something about it .
I wanted to investigate this whole roadrunner culture , and what it was doing to me and to everyone else .
And I had two questions in my head .
The first was , how did we get so fast ?
And the second is , is it possible , or even desirable , to slow down ?
Now , if you think about how our world got so accelerated , the usual suspects rear their heads .
You think of , you know , urbanization , consumerism , the workplace , technology .
But I think if you cut through those forces , you get to what might be the deeper driver , the nub of the question , which is how we think about time itself .
In other cultures , time is cyclical .
It &apos;s seen as moving in great , unhurried circles .
It &apos;s always renewing and refreshing itself .
Whereas in the West , time is linear .
It &apos;s a finite resource ; it &apos;s always draining away .
You either use it , or lose it .
&quot; &quot; Time is money , &quot; &quot; as Benjamin Franklin said .
And I think what that does to us psychologically is it creates an equation .
Time is scarce , so what do we do ?
Well — well , we speed up , don &apos;t we ?
We try and do more and more with less and less time .
We turn every moment of every day into a race to the finish line — a finish line , incidentally , that we never reach , but a finish line nonetheless .
And I guess that the question is , is it possible to break free from that mindset ?
And thankfully , the answer is yes , because what I discovered , when I began looking around , that there is a global backlash against this culture that tells us that faster is always better , and that busier is best .
Right across the world , people are doing the unthinkable : they &apos;re slowing down , and finding that , although conventional wisdom tells you that if you slow down , you &apos;re road kill , the opposite turns out to be true : that by slowing down at the right moments , people find that they do everything better .
They eat better ; they make love better ; they exercise better ; they work better ; they live better .
And , in this kind of cauldron of moments and places and acts of deceleration , lie what a lot of people now refer to as the &quot; &quot; International Slow Movement . &quot; &quot; Now if you &apos;ll permit me a small act of hypocrisy , I &apos;ll just give you a very quick overview of what &apos;s going on inside the Slow Movement . If you think of food , many of you will have heard of the Slow Food movement .
Started in Italy , but has spread across the world , and now has 100,000 members in 50 countries .
And it &apos;s driven by a very simple and sensible message , which is that we get more pleasure and more health from our food when we cultivate , cook and consume it at a reasonable pace .
I think also the explosion of the organic farming movement , and the renaissance of farmers &apos; markets , are other illustrations of the fact that people are desperate to get away from eating and cooking and cultivating their food on an industrial timetable .
They want to get back to slower rhythms .
And out of the Slow Food movement has grown something called the Slow Cities movement , which has started in Italy , but has spread right across Europe and beyond .
And in this , towns begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape , so that people are encouraged to slow down and smell the roses and connect with one another .
So they might curb traffic , or put in a park bench , or some green space .
And in some ways , these changes add up to more than the sum of their parts , because I think when a Slow City becomes officially a Slow City , it &apos;s kind of like a philosophical declaration .
It &apos;s saying to the rest of world , and to the people in that town , that we believe that in the 21st century , slowness has a role to play .
In medicine , I think a lot of people are deeply disillusioned with the kind of quick-fix mentality you find in conventional medicine .
And millions of them around the world are turning to complementary and alternative forms of medicine , which tend to tap into sort of slower , gentler , more holistic forms of healing .
Now , obviously the jury is out on many of these complementary therapies , and I personally doubt that the coffee enema will ever , you know , gain mainstream approval .
But other treatments such as acupuncture and massage , and even just relaxation , clearly have some kind of benefit .
And blue-chip medical colleges everywhere are starting to study these things to find out how they work , and what we might learn from them .
Sex . There &apos;s an awful lot of fast sex around , isn &apos;t there ?
I was coming to — well — no pun intended there .
I was making my way , let &apos;s say , slowly to Oxford , and I went through a news agent , and I saw a magazine , a men &apos;s magazine , and it said on the front , &quot; How to bring your partner to orgasm in 30 seconds . &quot;
So , you know , even sex is on a stopwatch these days .
Now , you know , I like a quickie as much as the next person , but I think that there &apos;s an awful lot to be gained from slow sex — from slowing down in the bedroom .
You know , you tap into that — those deeper , sort of , psychological , emotional , spiritual currents , and you get a better orgasm with the buildup .
You can get more bang for your buck , let &apos;s say .
I mean , the Pointer Sisters said it most eloquently , didn &apos;t they , when they sang the praises of &quot; &quot; a lover with a slow hand . &quot; &quot; Now , we all laughed at Sting a few years ago when he went Tantric , but you fast-forward a few years , and now you find couples of all ages flocking to workshops , or maybe just on their own in their own bedrooms , finding ways to put on the brakes and have better sex .
And of course , in Italy where — I mean , Italians always seem to know where to find their pleasure — they &apos;ve launched an official Slow Sex movement .
The workplace .
Right across much of the world — North America being a notable exception — working hours have been coming down .
And Europe is an example of that , and people finding that their quality of life improves as they &apos;re working less , and also that their hourly productivity goes up .
Now , clearly there are problems with the 35-hour workweek in France — too much , too soon , too rigid .
But other countries in Europe , notably the Nordic countries , are showing that it &apos;s possible to have a kick-ass economy without being a workaholic .
And Norway , Sweden , Denmark and Finland now rank among the top six most competitive nations on Earth , and they work the kind of hours that would make the average American weep with envy .
And if you go beyond sort of the country level , down at the micro-company level , more and more companies now are realizing that they need to allow their staff either to work fewer hours or just to unplug — to take a lunch break , or to go sit in a quiet room , to switch off their Blackberrys and laptops — you at the back — mobile phones , during the work day or on the weekend , so that they have time to recharge and for the brain to slide into that kind of creative mode of thought .
It &apos;s not just , though , these days , adults who overwork , though , is it ? It &apos;s children , too .
I &apos;m 37 , and my childhood ended in the mid- &apos; 80s , and I look at kids now , and I &apos;m just amazed by the way they race around with more homework , more tutoring , more extracurriculars than we would ever have conceived of a generation ago .
And some of the most heartrending emails that I get on my website are actually from adolescents hovering on the edge of burnout , pleading with me to write to their parents , to help them slow down , to help them get off this full-throttle treadmill .
But thankfully , there is a backlash there in parenting as well , and you &apos;re finding that , you know , towns in the United States are now banding together and banning extracurriculars on a particular day of the month , so that people can , you know , decompress and have some family time , and slow down .
Homework is another thing . There are homework bans springing up all over the developed world in schools which had been piling on the homework for years , and now they &apos;re discovering that less can be more .
So there was a case up in Scotland recently where a fee-paying , high-achieving private school banned homework for everyone under the age of 13 , and the high-achieving parents freaked out and said , &quot; &quot; What are you — you know , our kids will fall &quot; &quot; — the headmaster said , &quot; No , no , your children need to slow down at the end of the day . &quot;
And just this last month , the exam results came in , and in math , science , marks went up 20 percent on average last year .
And I think what &apos;s very revealing is that the elite universities , who are often cited as the reason that people drive their kids and hothouse them so much , are starting to notice the caliber of students coming to them is falling . These kids have wonderful marks ; they have CVs jammed with extracurriculars , to the point that would make your eyes water .
But they lack spark ; they lack the ability to think creatively and think outside — they don &apos;t know how to dream . And so what these Ivy League schools , and Oxford and Cambridge and so on , are starting to send a message to parents and students that they need to put on the brakes a little bit .
And in Harvard , for instance , they send out a letter to undergraduates — freshmen — telling them that they &apos;ll get more out of life , and more out of Harvard , if they put on the brakes , if they do less , but give time to things , the time that things need , to enjoy them , to savor them .
And even if they sometimes do nothing at all .
And that letter is called — very revealing , I think — &quot; &quot; Slow Down ! &quot; &quot; — with an exclamation mark on the end .
So wherever you look , the message , it seems to me , is the same : that less is very often more , that slower is very often better . But that said , of course , it &apos;s not that easy to slow down , is it ?
I mean , you heard that I got a speeding ticket while I was researching my book on the benefits of slowness , and that &apos;s true , but that &apos;s not all of it .
I was actually en route to a dinner held by Slow Food at the time .
And if that &apos;s not shaming enough , I got that ticket in Italy .
And if any of you have ever driven on an Italian highway , you &apos;ll have a pretty good idea of how fast I was going .
( Laughter ) But why is it so hard to slow down ?
I think there are various reasons .
One is that speed is fun , you know , speed is sexy .
It &apos;s all that adrenaline rush . It &apos;s hard to give it up .
I think there &apos;s a kind of metaphysical dimension — that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off from the bigger , deeper questions .
We fill our head with distraction , with busyness , so that we don &apos;t have to ask , am I well ? Am I happy ? Are my children growing up right ?
Are politicians making good decisions on my behalf ?
Another reason — although I think , perhaps , the most powerful reason — why we find it hard to slow down is the cultural taboo that we &apos;ve erected against slowing down .
&quot; &quot; Slow &quot; &quot; is a dirty word in our culture .
It &apos;s a byword for &quot; &quot; lazy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slacker , &quot; &quot; for being somebody who gives up .
You know , &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a bit slow . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s actually synonymous with being stupid .
I guess what the Slow Movement — the purpose of the Slow Movement , or its main goal , really , is to tackle that taboo , and to say that yes , sometimes slow is not the answer , that there is such a thing as &quot; &quot; bad slow . &quot; &quot; You know , I got stuck on the M25 , which is a ring road around London , recently , and spent three-and-a-half hours there . And I can tell you , that &apos;s really bad slow .
But the new idea , the sort of revolutionary idea , of the Slow Movement , is that there is such a thing as &quot; &quot; good slow , &quot; &quot; too .
And good slow is , you know , taking the time to eat a meal with your family , with the TV switched off .
Or taking the time to look at a problem from all angles in the office to make the best decision at work .
Or even simply just taking the time to slow down and savor your life .
Now , one of the things that I found most uplifting about all of this stuff that &apos;s happened around the book since it came out , is the reaction to it .
And I knew that when my book on slowness came out , it would be welcomed by the New Age brigade , but it &apos;s also been taken up , with great gusto , by the corporate world — you know , business press , but also big companies and leadership organizations .
Because people at the top of the chain , people like you , I think , are starting to realize that there &apos;s too much speed in the system , there &apos;s too much busyness , and it &apos;s time to find , or get back to that lost art of shifting gears .
Another encouraging sign , I think , is that it &apos;s not just in the developed world that this idea &apos;s been taken up . In the developing world , in countries that are on the verge of making that leap into first world status — China , Brazil , Thailand , Poland , and so on — these countries have embraced the idea of the Slow Movement , many people in them , and there &apos;s a debate going on in their media , on the streets .
Because I think they &apos;re looking at the West , and they &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; Well , we like that aspect of what you &apos;ve got , but we &apos;re not so sure about that . &quot; &quot; So all of that said , is it , I guess , is it possible ?
That &apos;s really the main question before us today . Is it possible to slow down ? And I &apos;m happy to be able to say to you that the answer is a resounding yes .
And I present myself as Exhibit A , a kind of reformed and rehabilitated speed-aholic .
I still love speed . You know , I live in London , and I work as a journalist , and I enjoy the buzz and the busyness , and the adrenaline rush that comes from both of those things .
I play squash and ice hockey , two very fast sports , and I wouldn &apos;t give them up for the world .
But I &apos;ve also , over the last year or so , got in touch with my inner tortoise .
( Laughter ) And what that means is that I no longer overload myself gratuitously .
My default mode is no longer to be a rush-aholic .
I no longer hear time &apos;s winged chariot drawing near , or at least not as much as I did before .
I can actually hear it now , because I see my time is ticking off .
And the upshot of all of that is that I actually feel a lot happier , healthier , more productive than I ever have .
I feel like I &apos;m living my life rather than actually just racing through it .
And perhaps , the most important measure of the success of this is that I feel that my relationships are a lot deeper , richer , stronger .
And for me , I guess , the litmus test for whether this would work , and what it would mean , was always going to be bedtime stories , because that &apos;s sort of where the journey began . And there too the news is rosy . You know , at the end of the day , I go into my son &apos;s room .
I don &apos;t wear a watch . I switch off my computer , so I can &apos;t hear the email pinging into the basket , and I just slow down to his pace and we read .
And because children have their own tempo and internal clock , they don &apos;t do quality time , where you schedule 10 minutes for them to open up to you .
They need you to move at their rhythm .
I find that 10 minutes into a story , you know , my son will suddenly say , &quot; &quot; You know , something happened in the playground today that really bothered me . &quot; &quot; And we &apos;ll go off and have a conversation on that .
And I now find that bedtime stories used to be a box on my to-do list , something that I dreaded , because it was so slow and I had to get through it quickly .
It &apos;s become my reward at the end of the day , something I really cherish .
And I have a kind of Hollywood ending to my talk this afternoon , which goes a little bit like this : a few months ago , I was getting ready to go on another book tour , and I had my bags packed .
I was downstairs by the front door , and I was waiting for a taxi , and my son came down the stairs and he &apos;d made a card for me . And he was carrying it .
He &apos;d gone and stapled two cards , very like these , together , and put a sticker of his favorite character , Tintin , on the front .
And he said to me , or he handed this to me , and I read it , and it said , &quot; &quot; To Daddy , love Benjamin . &quot; &quot; And I thought , &quot; &quot; Aw , that &apos;s really sweet .
So , start with stereotypes . You look at me , you know my name , you know certain facts about me , and you could make certain judgments .
You could make guesses about my ethnicity , my political affiliation , my religious beliefs .
And the thing is , these judgments tend to be accurate .
We &apos;re very good at this sort of thing .
So everybody here has a lot of experience with chairs and apples and dogs , and based on this , you could see unfamiliar examples and you could guess , you could sit on the chair , you could eat the apple , the dog will bark .
Now we might be wrong .
The chair could collapse if you sit on it , the apple might be poison , the dog might not bark , and in fact , this is my dog Tessie , who doesn &apos;t bark .
Woman : The American people are suffering in our country right now .
Why do we continue to send foreign aid to other countries when we need all the help we can get for ourselves ?
Now some of you may reject this .
Tajfel was born in Poland in 1919 .
And what started his career is an insight that the way most people were thinking about the Holocaust was wrong .
Many people , most people at the time , viewed the Holocaust as sort of representing some tragic flaw on the part of the Germans , some genetic taint , some authoritarian personality .
And Tajfel rejected this .
Tajfel said what we see in the Holocaust is just an exaggeration of normal psychological processes that exist in every one of us .
And to explore this , he did a series of classic studies with British adolescents .
So one of the puppets might like green beans .
They test the babies own food preferences , and babies typically prefer the graham crackers .
But the question is , does this matter to babies in how they treat the puppets ? And it matters a lot .
( Laughter ) We see this sort of in-group , out-group psychology all the time .
We see it in political clashes within groups with different ideologies .
We see it in its extreme in cases of war , where the out-group isn &apos;t merely given less , but dehumanized , as in the Nazi perspective of Jews as vermin or lice , or the American perspective of Japanese as rats .
Stereotypes can also go awry .
So often they &apos;re rational and useful , but sometimes they &apos;re irrational , they give the wrong answers , and other times they lead to plainly immoral consequences .
And the case that &apos;s been most studied is the case of race .
McCain is a celebrated war hero , and many people would explicitly say he has more of an American story than Obama .
But they also compared Obama to British Prime Minister Tony Blair , and they found that Blair was also thought of as more American than Obama , even though subjects explicitly understood that he &apos;s not American at all .
But they were responding , of course , to the color of his skin .
In one recent study , researchers put ads on eBay for the sale of baseball cards .
Some of them were held by white hands , others by black hands .
And there are different avenues .
None of this I think is a secret to the people who are engaged in charity work .
This is Harriet Beecher Stowe .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s an exaggeration to say that the major catalyst in America for moral change has been a situation comedy .
It could be China or India or a country in Africa .
And Smith says , how would you respond ?
And you would say , well that &apos;s too bad , and you &apos;d go on to the rest of your life .
If you were to open up The New York Times online or something , and discover this , and in fact this happens to us all the time , we go about our lives .
But imagine instead , Smith says , you were to learn that tomorrow you were to have your little finger chopped off .
Smith says , that would matter a lot .
You would not sleep that night wondering about that .
So this raises the question : Would you sacrifice thousands of lives to save your little finger ?
Now answer this in the privacy of your own head , but Smith says , absolutely not , what a horrid thought .
We have bound ourselves .
And we bind ourselves in other ways as well .
I think prejudice and bias illustrate a fundamental duality of human nature .
And it &apos;s in this way that reason helps us create a better world .
Thank you .

I want you now to imagine a wearable robot that gives you superhuman abilities , or another one that takes wheelchair users up standing and walking again .
We at Berkeley Bionics call these robots exoskeletons .
These are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning , and it will give you extra strength , and it will further enhance your speed , and it will help you , for instance , to manage your balance .
It is actually the true integration of the man and the machine .
But not only that — it will integrate and network you to the universe and other devices out there .
This is just not some blue sky thinking .
To show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the American soldier , that on average does carry about 100 lbs. on their backs , and they are being asked to carry more equipment .
Obviously , this is resulting in some major complications — back injuries , 30 percent of them — chronic back injuries .
So we thought we would look at this challenge and create an exoskeleton that would help deal with this issue .
So let me now introduce to you HULC — or the Human Universal Load Carrier .
Soldier : With the HULC exoskeleton , I can carry 200 lbs. over varied terrain for many hours .
Its flexible design allows for deep squats , crawls and high-agility movements .
It senses what I want to do , where I want to go , and then augments my strength and endurance .
Eythor Bender : We are ready with our industry partner to introduce this device , this new exoskeleton this year .
So this is for real .
Now let &apos;s turn our heads towards the wheelchair users , something that I &apos;m particularly passionate about .
There are 68 million people estimated to be in wheelchairs worldwide .
This is about one percent of the total population .
And that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
We are talking here about , oftentimes , very young individuals with spinal cord injuries , that in the prime of their life — 20s , 30s , 40s — hit a wall and the wheelchair &apos;s the only option .
But it is also the aging population that is multiplying in numbers .
And the only option , pretty much — when it &apos;s stroke or other complications — is the wheelchair .
And that is actually for the last 500 years , since its very successful introduction , I must say .
So we thought we would start writing a brand new chapter of mobility .
Let me now introduce you to eLEGS that is worn by Amanda Boxtel that 19 years ago was spinal cord injured , and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for 19 years until now .
( Applause ) Amanda Boxtel : Thank you . ( Applause )
EB : Amanda is wearing our eLEGS set .
It has sensors .
It &apos;s completely non-invasive , sensors in the crutches that send signals back to our onboard computer that is sitting here at her back .
There are battery packs here as well that power motors that are sitting at her hips , as well as her knee joints , that move her forward in this kind of smooth and very natural gait .
AB : I was 24 years old and at the top of my game when a freak summersault while downhill skiing paralyzed me .
In a split second , I lost all sensation and movement below my pelvis .
Not long afterwards , a doctor strode into my hospital room , and he said , &quot; &quot; Amanda , you &apos;ll never walk again . &quot; &quot; And that was 19 yeas ago .
He robbed every ounce of hope from my being .
Adaptive technology has since enabled me to learn how to downhill ski again , to rock climb and even handcycle .
But nothing has been invented that enables me to walk , until now .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
EB : As you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to sit down and have discussions with you .
It &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations — not only for the soldiers , or for Amanda here and all the wheelchair users , but for everyone .
AB : Thanks .
( Applause )
How do they differ from the rest of us ?
In two of the three great arenas of life , by the time Len was 30 , Len was enormously successful .
By the time he was 20 , he was an options trader .
Second , in play , he &apos;s a national champion bridge player .
And the reason he was , was that Len is a cold fish .
What you get out of that is not smiley-ness .
So , that &apos;s the second path .
This is the most venerable of the happinesses , traditionally .
Now , OK , you can open your eyes .
And we ask the question as a function of the three different lives , how much life satisfaction do you get ?
The pursuit of meaning is the strongest .
Five years ago , I experienced a bit of what it must have been like to be Alice in Wonderland .
Penn State asked me , a communications teacher , to teach a communications class for engineering students .
And I was scared . ( Laughter ) Really scared . Scared of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big , unfamiliar words .
But as these conversations unfolded , I experienced what Alice must have when she went down that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world .
That &apos;s just how I felt as I had those conversations with the students . I was amazed at the ideas that they had , and I wanted others to experience this wonderland as well .
And I believe the key to opening that door is great communication .
We desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world .
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grandest challenges , from energy to environment to health care , among others , and if we don &apos;t know about it and understand it , then the work isn &apos;t done , and I believe it &apos;s our responsibility as non-scientists to have these interactions .
But these great conversations can &apos;t occur if our scientists and engineers don &apos;t invite us in to see their wonderland .
So scientists and engineers , please , talk nerdy to us .
I want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is engaging .
First question to answer for us : so what ?
Tell us why your science is relevant to us .
Don &apos;t just tell me that you study trabeculae , but tell me that you study trabeculae , which is the mesh-like structure of our bones because it &apos;s important to understanding and treating osteoporosis .
And when you &apos;re describing your science , beware of jargon .
Jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas .
Sure , you can say &quot; &quot; spatial and temporal , &quot; &quot; but why not just say &quot; &quot; space and time , &quot; &quot; which is so much more accessible to us ?
And making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down .
Instead , as Einstein said , make everything as simple as possible , but no simpler .
You can clearly communicate your science without compromising the ideas .
A few things to consider are having examples , stories and analogies . Those are ways to engage and excite us about your content .
And when presenting your work , drop the bullet points .
Have you ever wondered why they &apos;re called bullet points ? ( Laughter ) What do bullets do ? Bullets kill , and they will kill your presentation .
A slide like this is not only boring , but it relies too much on the language area of our brain , and causes us to become overwhelmed .
Instead , this example slide by Genevieve Brown is much more effective . It &apos;s showing that the special structure of trabeculae are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the Eiffel Tower .
And the trick here is to use a single , readable sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost , and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what &apos;s being described .
So I think these are just a few keys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonderland that is science and engineering .
And because the engineers that I &apos;ve worked with have taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd , I want to summarize with an equation . ( Laughter ) Take your science , subtract your bullet points and your jargon , divide by relevance , meaning share what &apos;s relevant to the audience , and multiply it by the passion that you have for this incredible work that you &apos;re doing , and that is going to equal incredible interactions that are full of understanding .
And so , scientists and engineers , when you &apos;ve solved this equation , by all means , talk nerdy to me . ( Laughter ) Thank you . ( Applause )
We can turn data into a time-lapse view of a global economy in motion .
And by tracking markers on an insect &apos;s wings , we can visualize the air flow that they produce .
And what we learn can lead us to new kinds of robotic flyers that can expand our vision of important and remote places .
The electron microscope fires electrons which creates images which can magnify things by as much as a million times .
Can you guess what this is ?
A caterpillar &apos;s mouth .
An eggshell .
This journey will take us all the way down to the nano world .
The silk is 100 times thinner than human hair .
On there is bacteria , and near that bacteria , 10 times smaller , a virus .
Tonight , I want to have a conversation about this incredible global issue that &apos;s at the intersection of land use , food and environment , something we can all relate to , and what I &apos;ve been calling the other inconvenient truth .
But first , I want to take you on a little journey .
Let &apos;s first visit our planet , but at night , and from space .
This is what our planet looks like from outer space at nighttime , if you were to take a satellite and travel around the planet . And the thing you would notice first , of course , is how dominant the human presence on our planet is .
We see cities , we see oil fields , you can even make out fishing fleets in the sea , that we are dominating much of our planet , and mostly through the use of energy that we see here at night .
But let &apos;s go back and drop it a little deeper and look during the daytime .
What we see during the day is our landscapes .
This is part of the Amazon Basin , a place called Rondônia in the south-center part of the Brazilian Amazon .
If you look really carefully in the upper right-hand corner , you &apos;re going to see a thin white line , which is a road that was built in the 1970s .
If we come back to the same place in 2001 , what we &apos;re going to find is that these roads spurt off more roads , and more roads after that , at the end of which is a small clearing in the rainforest where there are going to be a few cows .
These cows are used for beef . We &apos;re going to eat these cows .
And these cows are eaten basically in South America , in Brazil and Argentina . They &apos;re not being shipped up here .
But this kind of fishbone pattern of deforestation is something we notice a lot of around the tropics , especially in this part of the world .
If we go a little bit further south in our little tour of the world , we can go to the Bolivian edge of the Amazon , here also in 1975 , and if you look really carefully , there &apos;s a thin white line through that kind of seam , and there &apos;s a lone farmer out there in the middle of the primeval jungle .
Let &apos;s come back again a few years later , here in 2003 , and we &apos;ll see that that landscape actually looks a lot more like Iowa than it does like a rainforest .
In fact , what you &apos;re seeing here are soybean fields .
These soybeans are being shipped to Europe and to China as animal feed , especially after the mad cow disease scare about a decade ago , where we don &apos;t want to feed animals animal protein anymore , because that can transmit disease .
Instead , we want to feed them more vegetable proteins .
So soybeans have really exploded , showing how trade and globalization are really responsible for the connections to rainforests and the Amazon — an incredibly strange and interconnected world that we have today .
Well , again and again , what we find as we look around the world in our little tour of the world is that landscape after landscape after landscape have been cleared and altered for growing food and other crops .
So one of the questions we &apos;ve been asking is , how much of the world is used to grow food , and where is it exactly , and how can we change that into the future , and what does it mean ?
Well , our team has been looking at this on a global scale , using satellite data and ground-based data kind of to track farming on a global scale .
And this is what we found , and it &apos;s startling .
This map shows the presence of agriculture on planet Earth .
The green areas are the areas we use to grow crops , like wheat or soybeans or corn or rice or whatever .
That &apos;s 16 million square kilometers &apos; worth of land .
If you put it all together in one place , it &apos;d be the size of South America .
The second area , in brown , is the world &apos;s pastures and rangelands , where our animals live .
That area &apos;s about 30 million square kilometers , or about an Africa &apos;s worth of land , a huge amount of land , and it &apos;s the best land , of course , is what you see . And what &apos;s left is , like , the middle of the Sahara Desert , or Siberia , or the middle of a rain forest .
We &apos;re using a planet &apos;s worth of land already .
If we look at this carefully , we find it &apos;s about 40 percent of the Earth &apos;s land surface is devoted to agriculture , and it &apos;s 60 times larger than all the areas we complain about , our suburban sprawl and our cities where we mostly live .
Half of humanity lives in cities today , but a 60-times-larger area is used to grow food .
So this is an amazing kind of result , and it really shocked us when we looked at that .
So we &apos;re using an enormous amount of land for agriculture , but also we &apos;re using a lot of water .
This is a photograph flying into Arizona , and when you look at it , you &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; What are they growing here ? &quot; &quot; It turns out they &apos;re growing lettuce in the middle of the desert using water sprayed on top .
Now , the irony is , it &apos;s probably sold in our supermarket shelves in the Twin Cities .
But what &apos;s really interesting is , this water &apos;s got to come from some place , and it comes from here , the Colorado River in North America .
Well , the Colorado on a typical day in the 1950s , this is just , you know , not a flood , not a drought , kind of an average day , it looks something like this .
But if we come back today , during a normal condition to the exact same location , this is what &apos;s left .
The difference is mainly irrigating the desert for food , or maybe golf courses in Scottsdale , you take your pick .
Well , this is a lot of water , and again , we &apos;re mining water and using it to grow food , and today , if you travel down further down the Colorado , it dries up completely and no longer flows into the ocean .
We &apos;ve literally consumed an entire river in North America for irrigation .
Well , that &apos;s not even the worst example in the world .
This probably is : the Aral Sea .
Now , a lot you will remember this from your geography classes .
This is in the former Soviet Union in between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan , one of the great inland seas of the world .
But there &apos;s kind of a paradox here , because it looks like it &apos;s surrounded by desert . Why is this sea here ?
The reason it &apos;s here is because , on the right-hand side , you see two little rivers kind of coming down through the sand , feeding this basin with water .
Those rivers are draining snowmelt from mountains far to the east , where snow melts , it travels down the river through the desert , and forms the great Aral Sea .
Well , in the 1950s , the Soviets decided to divert that water to irrigate the desert to grow cotton , believe it or not , in Kazakhstan , to sell cotton to the international markets to bring foreign currency into the Soviet Union .
They really needed the money .
Well , you can imagine what happens . You turn off the water supply to the Aral Sea , what &apos;s going to happen ?
Here it is in 1973 , 1986 , 1999 , 2004 , and about 11 months ago .
It &apos;s pretty extraordinary .
Now a lot of us in the audience here live in the Midwest .
Imagine that was Lake Superior .
Imagine that was Lake Huron .
It &apos;s an extraordinary change .
This is not only a change in water and where the shoreline is , this is a change in the fundamentals of the environment of this region .
Let &apos;s start with this .
The Soviet Union didn &apos;t really have a Sierra Club .
Let &apos;s put it that way .
So what you find in the bottom of the Aral Sea ain &apos;t pretty .
There &apos;s a lot of toxic waste , a lot of things that were dumped there that are now becoming airborne .
One of those small islands that was remote and impossible to get to was a site of Soviet biological weapons testing .
You can walk there today .
Weather patterns have changed .
Nineteen of the unique 20 fish species found only in the Aral Sea are now wiped off the face of the Earth .
This is an environmental disaster writ large .
But let &apos;s bring it home .
This is a picture that Al Gore gave me a few years ago that he took when he was in the Soviet Union a long , long time ago , showing the fishing fleets of the Aral Sea .
You see the canal they dug ?
They were so desperate to try to , kind of , float the boats into the remaining pools of water , but they finally had to give up because the piers and the moorings simply couldn &apos;t keep up with the retreating shoreline .
I don &apos;t know about you , but I &apos;m terrified that future archaeologists will dig this up and write stories about our time in history , and wonder , &quot; &quot; What were you thinking ? &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s the future we have to look forward to .
We already use about 50 percent of the Earth &apos;s fresh water that &apos;s sustainable , and agriculture alone is 70 percent of that .
So we use a lot of water , a lot of land for agriculture .
We also use a lot of the atmosphere for agriculture .
Usually when we think about the atmosphere , we think about climate change and greenhouse gases , and mostly around energy , but it turns out agriculture is one of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases too .
If you look at carbon dioxide from burning tropical rainforest , or methane coming from cows and rice , or nitrous oxide from too many fertilizers , it turns out agriculture is 30 percent of the greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere from human activity .
That &apos;s more than all our transportation .
It &apos;s more than all our electricity .
It &apos;s more than all other manufacturing , in fact .
It &apos;s the single largest emitter of greenhouse gases of any human activity in the world .
And yet , we don &apos;t talk about it very much .
So we have this incredible presence today of agriculture dominating our planet , whether it &apos;s 40 percent of our land surface , 70 percent of the water we use , 30 percent of our greenhouse gas emissions .
We &apos;ve doubled the flows of nitrogen and phosphorus around the world simply by using fertilizers , causing huge problems of water quality from rivers , lakes , and even oceans , and it &apos;s also the single biggest driver of biodiversity loss .
So without a doubt , agriculture is the single most powerful force unleashed on this planet since the end of the ice age . No question .
And it rivals climate change in importance .
And they &apos;re both happening at the same time .
But what &apos;s really important here to remember is that it &apos;s not all bad . It &apos;s not that agriculture &apos;s a bad thing .
In fact , we completely depend on it .
It &apos;s not optional . It &apos;s not a luxury . It &apos;s an absolute necessity .
We have to provide food and feed and , yeah , fiber and even biofuels to something like seven billion people in the world today , and if anything , we &apos;re going to have the demands on agriculture increase into the future . It &apos;s not going to go away .
It &apos;s going to get a lot bigger , mainly because of growing population . We &apos;re seven billion people today heading towards at least nine , probably nine and a half before we &apos;re done .
More importantly , changing diets .
As the world becomes wealthier as well as more populous , we &apos;re seeing increases in dietary consumption of meat , which take a lot more resources than a vegetarian diet does .
So more people , eating more stuff , and richer stuff , and of course having an energy crisis at the same time , where we have to replace oil with other energy sources that will ultimately have to include some kinds of biofuels and bio-energy sources .
So you put these together . It &apos;s really hard to see how we &apos;re going to get to the rest of the century without at least doubling global agricultural production .
Well , how are we going to do this ? How are going to double global ag production around the world ?
Well , we could try to farm more land .
This is an analysis we &apos;ve done , where on the left is where the crops are today , on the right is where they could be based on soils and climate , assuming climate change doesn &apos;t disrupt too much of this , which is not a good assumption .
We could farm more land , but the problem is the remaining lands are in sensitive areas .
They have a lot of biodiversity , a lot of carbon , things we want to protect .
So we could grow more food by expanding farmland , but we &apos;d better not , because it &apos;s ecologically a very , very dangerous thing to do .
Instead , we maybe want to freeze the footprint of agriculture and farm the lands we have better .
This is work that we &apos;re doing to try to highlight places in the world where we could improve yields without harming the environment .
The green areas here show where corn yields , just showing corn as an example , are already really high , probably the maximum you could find on Earth today for that climate and soil , but the brown areas and yellow areas are places where we &apos;re only getting maybe 20 or 30 percent of the yield you should be able to get .
You see a lot of this in Africa , even Latin America , but interestingly , Eastern Europe , where Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries used to be , is still a mess agriculturally .
Now , this would require nutrients and water .
It &apos;s going to either be organic or conventional or some mix of the two to deliver that .
Plants need water and nutrients .
But we can do this , and there are opportunities to make this work .
But we have to do it in a way that is sensitive to meeting the food security needs of the future and the environmental security needs of the future .
We have to figure out how to make this tradeoff between growing food and having a healthy environment work better .
Right now , it &apos;s kind of an all-or-nothing proposition .
We can grow food in the background — that &apos;s a soybean field — and in this flower diagram , it shows we grow a lot of food , but we don &apos;t have a lot clean water , we &apos;re not storing a lot of carbon , we don &apos;t have a lot of biodiversity .
In the foreground , we have this prairie that &apos;s wonderful from the environmental side , but you can &apos;t eat anything . What &apos;s there to eat ?
We need to figure out how to bring both of those together into a new kind of agriculture that brings them all together .
Now , when I talk about this , people often tell me , &quot; &quot; Well , isn &apos;t blank the answer ? &quot; &quot; — organic food , local food , GMOs , new trade subsidies , new farm bills — and yeah , we have a lot of good ideas here , but not any one of these is a silver bullet .
In fact , what I think they are is more like silver buckshot .
And I love silver buckshot . You put it together and you &apos;ve got something really powerful , but we need to put them together .
So what we have to do , I think , is invent a new kind of agriculture that blends the best ideas of commercial agriculture and the green revolution with the best ideas of organic farming and local food and the best ideas of environmental conservation , not to have them fighting each other but to have them collaborating together to form a new kind of agriculture , something I call &quot; &quot; terraculture , &quot; &quot; or farming for a whole planet .
Now , having this conversation has been really hard , and we &apos;ve been trying very hard to bring these key points to people to reduce the controversy , to increase the collaboration .
I want to show you a short video that does kind of show our efforts right now to bring these sides together into a single conversation . So let me show you that .
( Music ) ( &quot; &quot; Institute on the Environment , University of Minnesota : Driven to Discover &quot; &quot; ) ( Music ) ( &quot; &quot; The world population is growing by 75 million people each year .
That &apos;s almost the size of Germany .
Today , we &apos;re nearing 7 billion people .
At this rate , we &apos;ll reach 9 billion people by 2040 .
And we all need food .
But how ?
How do we feed a growing world without destroying the planet ?
We already know climate change is a big problem .
But it &apos;s not the only problem .
We need to face &apos; the other inconvenient truth . &apos; A global crisis in agriculture .
Population growth + meat consumption + dairy consumption + energy costs + bioenergy production = stress on natural resources .
More than 40 % of Earth &apos;s land has been cleared for agriculture .
Global croplands cover 16 million km ² .
That &apos;s almost the size of South America .
Global pastures cover 30 million km ² .
That &apos;s the size of Africa .
Agriculture uses 60 times more land than urban and suburban areas combined .
Irrigation is the biggest use of water on the planet .
We use 2,800 cubic kilometers of water on crops every year .
That &apos;s enough to fill 7,305 Empire State Buildings every day .
Today , many large rivers have reduced flows .
Some dry up altogether .
Look at the Aral Sea , now turned to desert .
Or the Colorado River , which no longer flows to the ocean .
Fertilizers have more than doubled the phosphorus and nitrogen in the environment .
The consequence ?
Widespread water pollution and massive degradation of lakes and rivers .
Surprisingly , agriculture is the biggest contributor to climate change .
It generates 30 % of greenhouse gas emissions .
That &apos;s more than the emissions from all electricity and industry , or from all the world &apos;s planes , trains and automobiles .
Most agricultural emissions come from tropical deforestation , methane from animals and rice fields , and nitrous oxide from over-fertilizing .
There is nothing we do that transforms the world more than agriculture .
And there &apos;s nothing we do that is more crucial to our survival .
Here &apos;s the dilemma ...
As the world grows by several billion more people , We &apos;ll need to double , maybe even triple , global food production .
So where do we go from here ?
We need a bigger conversation , an international dialogue .
We need to invest in real solutions : incentives for farmers , precision agriculture , new crop varieties , drip irrigation , gray water recycling , better tillage practices , smarter diets .
We need everyone at the table .
Advocates of commercial agriculture , environmental conservation , and organic farming ...
must work together .
There is no single solution .
We need collaboration , imagination , determination , because failure is not an option .
How do we feed the world without destroying it ?
Yeah , so we face one of the greatest grand challenges in all of human history today : the need to feed nine billion people and do so sustainably and equitably and justly , at the same time protecting our planet for this and future generations .
This is going to be one of the hardest things we ever have done in human history , and we absolutely have to get it right , and we have to get it right on our first and only try .
So thanks very much . ( Applause )
I &apos;m going to talk today about the pleasures of everyday life .
But I want to begin with a story of an unusual and terrible man .
This is Hermann Goering .
Goering was Hitler &apos;s second in command in World War II , his designated successor .
And like Hitler , Goering fancied himself a collector of art .
He went through Europe , through World War II , stealing , extorting and occasionally buying various paintings for his collection .
And what he really wanted was something by Vermeer .
Hitler had two of them , and he didn &apos;t have any .
So he finally found an art dealer , a Dutch art dealer named Han van Meegeren , who sold him a wonderful Vermeer for the cost of what would now be 10 million dollars .
And it was his favorite artwork ever .
World War II came to an end , and Goering was captured , tried at Nuremberg and ultimately sentenced to death .
Then the Allied forces went through his collections and found the paintings and went after the people who sold it to him .
And at some point the Dutch police came into Amsterdam and arrested Van Meegeren .
Van Meegeren was charged with the crime of treason , which is itself punishable by death .
Six weeks into his prison sentence , van Meegeren confessed .
But he didn &apos;t confess to treason .
He said , &quot; &quot; I did not sell a great masterpiece to that Nazi .
I painted it myself ; I &apos;m a forger . &quot; &quot; Now nobody believed him .
And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll prove it .
Bring me a canvas and some paint , and I will paint a Vermeer much better than I sold that disgusting Nazi .
I also need alcohol and morphine , because it &apos;s the only way I can work . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So they brought him in .
He painted a beautiful Vermeer .
And then the charges of treason were dropped .
He had a lesser charge of forgery , got a year sentence and died a hero to the Dutch people .
There &apos;s a lot more to be said about van Meegeren , but I want to turn now to Goering , who &apos;s pictured here being interrogated at Nuremberg .
Now Goering was , by all accounts , a terrible man .
Even for a Nazi , he was a terrible man .
His American interrogators described him as an amicable psychopath .
But you could feel sympathy for the reaction he had when he was told that his favorite painting was actually a forgery .
According to his biographer , &quot; &quot; He looked as if for the first time he had discovered there was evil in the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he killed himself soon afterwards .
He had discovered after all that the painting he thought was this was actually that .
It looked the same , but it had a different origin , it was a different artwork .
It wasn &apos;t just him who was in for a shock .
Once van Meegeren was on trial , he couldn &apos;t stop talking .
And he boasted about all the great masterpieces that he himself had painted that were attributed to other artists .
In particular , &quot; &quot; The Supper at Emmaus &quot; &quot; which was viewed as Vermeer &apos;s finest masterpiece , his best work — people would come &#91; from &#93; all over the world to see it — was actually a forgery .
It was not that painting , but that painting .
And when that was discovered , it lost all its value and was taken away from the museum .
Why does this matter ?
I &apos;m a psychologists — why do origins matter so much ?
Why do we respond so much to our knowledge of where something comes from ?
Well there &apos;s an answer that many people would give .
Many sociologists like Veblen and Wolfe would argue that the reason why we take origins so seriously is because we &apos;re snobs , because we &apos;re focused on status .
Among other things , if you want to show off how rich you are , how powerful you are , it &apos;s always better to own an original than a forgery because there &apos;s always going to be fewer originals than forgeries .
I don &apos;t doubt that that plays some role , but what I want to convince you of today is that there &apos;s something else going on . I want to convince you
that humans are , to some extent , natural born essentialists .
What I mean by this is we don &apos;t just respond to things as we see them , or feel them , or hear them .
Rather , our response is conditioned on our beliefs , about what they really are , what they came from , what they &apos;re made of , what their hidden nature is .
I want to suggest that this is true , not just for how we think about things , but how we react to things .
So I want to suggest that pleasure is deep — and that this isn &apos;t true just for higher level pleasures like art , but even the most seemingly simple pleasures are affected by our beliefs about hidden essences .
So take food .
Would you eat this ?
Well , a good answer is , &quot; &quot; It depends . What is it ? &quot; &quot; Some of you would eat it if it &apos;s pork , but not beef .
Some of you would eat it if it &apos;s beef , but not pork .
Few of you would eat it if it &apos;s a rat or a human .
Some of you would eat it only if it &apos;s a strangely colored piece of tofu .
That &apos;s not so surprising .
But what &apos;s more interesting is how it tastes to you will depend critically on what you think you &apos;re eating .
So one demonstration of this was done with young children .
How do you make children not just be more likely to eat carrots and drink milk , but to get more pleasure from eating carrots and drinking milk — to think they taste better ?
It &apos;s simple , you tell them they &apos;re from McDonald &apos;s .
They believe McDonald &apos;s food is tastier , and it leads them to experience it as tastier .
How do you get adults to really enjoy wine ?
It &apos;s very simple : pour it from an expensive bottle .
There are now dozens , perhaps hundreds of studies showing that if you believe you &apos;re drinking the expensive stuff , it tastes better to you .
This was recently done with a neuroscientific twist .
They get people into a fMRI scanner , and while they &apos;re lying there , through a tube , they get to sip wine .
In front of them on a screen is information about the wine .
Everybody , of course , drinks exactly the same wine .
But if you believe you &apos;re drinking expensive stuff , parts of the brain associated with pleasure and reward light up like a Christmas tree .
It &apos;s not just that you say it &apos;s more pleasurable , you say you like it more , you really experience it in a different way .
Or take sex .
These are stimuli I &apos;ve used in some of my studies .
And if you simply show people these pictures , they &apos;ll say these are fairly attractive people .
But how attractive you find them , how sexually or romantically moved you are by them , rests critically on who you think you &apos;re looking at .
You probably think the picture on the left is male , the one on the right is female .
If that belief turns out to be mistaken , it will make a difference .
( Laughter ) It will make a difference if they turn out to be much younger or much older than you think they are .
It will make a difference if you were to discover that the person you &apos;re looking at with lust is actually a disguised version of your son or daughter , your mother or father .
Knowing somebody &apos;s your kin typically kills the libido .
Maybe one of the most heartening findings from the psychology of pleasure is there &apos;s more to looking good than your physical appearance .
If you like somebody , they look better to you .
This is why spouses in happy marriages tend to think that their husband or wife looks much better than anyone else thinks that they do .
( Laughter ) A particularly dramatic example of this comes from a neurological disorder known as Capgras syndrome .
So Capgras syndrome is a disorder where you get a specific delusion .
Sufferers of Capgras syndrome believe that the people they love most in the world have been replaced by perfect duplicates .
Now often , a result of Capgras syndrome is tragic .
People have murdered those that they loved , believing that they were murdering an imposter .
But there &apos;s at least one case where Capgras syndrome had a happy ending .
This was recorded in 1931 .
&quot; &quot; Research described a woman with Capgras syndrome who complained about her poorly endowed and sexually inadequate lover . &quot; &quot; But that was before she got Capgras syndrome .
After she got it , &quot; &quot; She was happy to report that she has discovered that he possessed a double who was rich , virile , handsome and aristocratic . &quot; &quot; Of course , it was the same man , but she was seeing him in different ways .
As a third example , consider consumer products .
So one reason why you might like something is its utility .
You can put shoes on your feet ; you can play golf with golf clubs ; and chewed up bubble gum doesn &apos;t do anything at all for you .
But each of these three objects has value above and beyond what it can do for you based on its history .
The golf clubs were owned by John F. Kennedy and sold for three-quarters of a million dollars at auction .
The bubble gum was chewed up by pop star Britney Spears and sold for several hundreds of dollars .
And in fact , there &apos;s a thriving market in the partially eaten food of beloved people .
( Laughter ) The shoes are perhaps the most valuable of all .
According to an unconfirmed report , a Saudi millionaire offered 10 million dollars for this pair of shoes .
They were the ones thrown at George Bush at an Iraqi press conference several years ago .
( Applause ) Now this attraction to objects doesn &apos;t just work for celebrity objects .
Each one of us , most people , have something in our life that &apos;s literally irreplaceable , in that it has value because of its history — maybe your wedding ring , maybe your child &apos;s baby shoes — so that if it was lost , you couldn &apos;t get it back .
You could get something that looked like it or felt like it , but you couldn &apos;t get the same object back .
With my colleagues George Newman and Gil Diesendruck , we &apos;ve looked to see what sort of factors , what sort of history , matters for the objects that people like .
So in one of our experiments , we asked people to name a famous person who they adored , a living person they adored .
So one answer was George Clooney .
Then we asked them , &quot; How much would you pay for George Clooney &apos;s sweater ? &quot;
And the answer is a fair amount — more than you would pay for a brand new sweater or a sweater owned by somebody who you didn &apos;t adore .
Then we asked other groups of subjects — we gave them different restrictions and different conditions .
So for instance , we told some people , &quot; &quot; Look , you can buy the sweater , but you can &apos;t tell anybody you own it , and you can &apos;t resell it . &quot; &quot; That drops the value of it , suggesting that that &apos;s one reason why we like it .
But what really causes an effect is you tell people , &quot; &quot; Look , you could resell it , you could boast about it , but before it gets to you , it &apos;s thoroughly washed . &quot; &quot; That causes a huge drop in the value .
As my wife put it , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve washed away the Clooney cooties . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So let &apos;s go back to art .
I would love a Chagall . I love the work of Chagall .
If people want to get me something at the end of the conference , you could buy me a Chagall .
But I don &apos;t want a duplicate , even if I can &apos;t tell the difference .
That &apos;s not because , or it &apos;s not simply because , I &apos;m a snob and want to boast about having an original .
Rather , it &apos;s because I want something that has a specific history .
In the case of artwork , the history is special indeed .
The philosopher Denis Dutton in his wonderful book &quot; &quot; The Art Instinct &quot; &quot; makes the case that , &quot; &quot; The value of an artwork is rooted in assumptions about the human performance underlying its creation . &quot; &quot; And that could explain the difference between an original and a forgery .
They may look alike , but they have a different history .
The original is typically the product of a creative act , the forgery isn &apos;t .
I think this approach can explain differences in people &apos;s taste in art .
This is a work by Jackson Pollock .
Who here likes the work of Jackson Pollock ?
Okay . Who here , it does nothing for them ?
They just don &apos;t like it .
I &apos;m not going to make a claim about who &apos;s right , but I will make an empirical claim about people &apos;s intuitions , which is that , if you like the work of Jackson Pollock , you &apos;ll tend more so than the people who don &apos;t like it to believe that these works are difficult to create , that they require a lot of time and energy and creative energy .
I use Jackson Pollock on purpose as an example because there &apos;s a young American artist who paints very much in the style of Jackson Pollock , and her work was worth many tens of thousands of dollars — in large part because she &apos;s a very young artist .
This is Marla Olmstead who did most of her work when she was three years old .
The interesting thing about Marla Olmstead is her family made the mistake of inviting the television program 60 Minutes II into their house to film her painting .
And they then reported that her father was coaching her .
When this came out on television , the value of her art dropped to nothing .
It was the same art , physically , but the history had changed .
I &apos;ve been focusing now on the visual arts , but I want to give two examples from music .
This is Joshua Bell , a very famous violinist .
And the Washington Post reporter Gene Weingarten decided to enlist him for an audacious experiment .
The question is : How much would people like Joshua Bell , the music of Joshua Bell , if they didn &apos;t know they were listening to Joshua Bell ?
So he got Joshua Bell to take his million dollar violin down to a Washington D.C. subway station and stand in the corner and see how much money he would make .
And here &apos;s a brief clip of this .
( Violin music ) After being there for three-quarters of an hour , he made 32 dollars .
Not bad . It &apos;s also not good .
Apparently to really enjoy the music of Joshua Bell , you have to know you &apos;re listening to Joshua Bell .
He actually made 20 dollars more than that , but he didn &apos;t count it .
Because this woman comes up — you see at the end of the video — she comes up .
She had heard him at the Library of Congress a few weeks before at this extravagant black-tie affair .
So she &apos;s stunned that he &apos;s standing in a subway station .
So she &apos;s struck with pity .
She reaches into her purse and hands him a 20 .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The second example from music is from John Cage &apos;s modernist composition , &quot; 4 &apos; 33 &quot; . &quot;
As many of you know , this is the composition where the pianist sits at a bench , opens up the piano and sits and does nothing for four minutes and 33 seconds — that period of silence .
And people have different views on this .
But what I want to point out is you can buy this from iTunes .
( Laughter ) For a dollar 99 , you can listen to that silence , which is different than other forms of silence . ( Laughter )
Now I &apos;ve been talking so far about pleasure , but what I want to suggest is that everything I &apos;ve said applies as well to pain .
And how you think about what you &apos;re experiencing , your beliefs about the essence of it , affect how it hurts .
One lovely experiment was done by Kurt Gray and Dan Wegner .
What they did was they hooked up Harvard undergraduates to an electric shock machine .
And they gave them a series of painful electric shocks .
So it was a series of five painful shocks .
Half of them are told that they &apos;re being given the shocks by somebody in another room , but the person in the other room doesn &apos;t know they &apos;re giving them shocks .
There &apos;s no malevolence , they &apos;re just pressing a button .
The first shock is recorded as very painful .
The second shock feels less painful , because you get a bit used to it .
The third drops , the fourth , the fifth .
The pain gets less .
In the other condition , they &apos;re told that the person in the next room is shocking them on purpose — knows they &apos;re shocking them .
The first shock hurts like hell .
The second shock hurts just as much , and the third and the fourth and the fifth .
It hurts more if you believe somebody is doing it to you on purpose .
The most extreme example of this is that in some cases , pain under the right circumstances can transform into pleasure .
Humans have this extraordinarily interesting property that will often seek out low-level doses of pain in controlled circumstances and take pleasure from it — as in the eating of hot chili peppers and roller coaster rides .
The point was nicely summarized by the poet John Milton who wrote , &quot; &quot; The mind is its own place , and in itself can make a heaven of hell , a hell of heaven . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;ll end with that . Thank you .
( Applause )
I gave out homework assignments .
Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals .
But we need more .
&#91; And &#93; then a Plank in Reason , broke , and I fell down and down — and hit a World , at every plunge , and Finished knowing — then — &quot; &quot; We know depression through metaphors .
Emily Dickinson was able to convey it in language , Goya in an image .
In 1991 , I had a series of losses .
You know it &apos;s ridiculous while you &apos;re experiencing it .
And then the anxiety set in .
The next day I started with the medications and the therapy .
And the other was that I had access to good treatment .
Depression is the flaw in love .
What are the mechanisms that allow people to survive ?
But the truth lies .
I became obsessed with that sentence : &quot; But the truth lies . &quot;
And then she said , &quot; &quot; You know , my husband would never understand this .
Depression is so exhausting .
I suggested to her that she also should look up obsessive compulsive disorder in the DSM .
They didn &apos;t include drumming or music to get people &apos;s blood going .
He was constantly depressed .
Then he would feel sort of disoriented for a week .
Then he would feel okay for a week .
Then he would have a week of going downhill .
And he had the cingulotomy , and it was incredibly successful .
He &apos;s now a friend of mine .
I &apos;m alive and grateful .
One of them , Lolly , came in , and this is what she said the day she came in .
My husband has been telling me I &apos;m stupid , I &apos;m ugly .
Those are the things that I feel sad about now .
And I said to myself , well , what is the conclusion ?
How did those people who have better lives even with bigger depression manage to get through ?
So , stepping down out of the bus , I headed back to the corner to head west en route to a braille training session .
It was the winter of 2009 , and I had been blind for about a year .
Things were going pretty well .
Safely reaching the other side , I turned to the left , pushed the auto-button for the audible pedestrian signal , and waited my turn .
As it went off , I took off and safely got to the other side .
Stepping onto the sidewalk , I then heard the sound of a steel chair slide across the concrete sidewalk in front of me .
I know there &apos;s a cafe on the corner , and they have chairs out in front , so I just adjusted to the left to get closer to the street .
As I did , so slid the chair .
I just figured I &apos;d made a mistake , and went back to the right , and so slid the chair in perfect synchronicity .
Now I was getting a little anxious .
I went back to the left , and so slid the chair , blocking my path of travel .
Now , I was officially freaking out .
So I yelled , &quot; Who the hell &apos;s out there ? What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
Just then , over my shout , I heard something else , a familiar rattle .
It sounded familiar , and I quickly considered another possibility , and I reached out with my left hand , as my fingers brushed against something fuzzy , and I came across an ear , the ear of a dog , perhaps a golden retriever .
Its leash had been tied to the chair as her master went in for coffee , and she was just persistent in her efforts to greet me , perhaps get a scratch behind the ear .
Who knows , maybe she was volunteering for service .
( Laughter ) But that little story is really about the fears and misconceptions that come along with the idea of moving through the city without sight , seemingly oblivious to the environment and the people around you .
So let me step back and set the stage a little bit .
On St. Patrick &apos;s Day of 2008 , I reported to the hospital for surgery to remove a brain tumor .
The surgery was successful .
Two days later , my sight started to fail .
On the third day , it was gone .
Immediately , I was struck by an incredible sense of fear , of confusion , of vulnerability , like anybody would .
But as I had time to stop and think , I actually started to realize I had a lot to be grateful for .
In particular , I thought about my dad , who had passed away from complications from brain surgery .
He was 36 . I was seven at the time .
So although I had every reason to be fearful of what was ahead , and had no clue quite what was going to happen , I was alive .
My son still had his dad .
And besides , it &apos;s not like I was the first person ever to lose their sight .
I knew there had to be all sorts of systems and techniques and training to have to live a full and meaningful , active life without sight .
So by the time I was discharged from the hospital a few days later , I left with a mission , a mission to get out and get the best training as quickly as I could and get on to rebuilding my life .
Within six months , I had returned to work .
My training had started .
I even started riding a tandem bike with my old cycling buddies , and was commuting to work on my own , walking through town and taking the bus .
It was a lot of hard work .
But what I didn &apos;t anticipate through that rapid transition was the incredible experience of the juxtaposition of my sighted experience up against my unsighted experience of the same places and the same people within such a short period of time .
From that came a lot of insights , or outsights , as I called them , things that I learned since losing my sight .
These outsights ranged from the trival to the profound , from the mundane to the humorous .
As an architect , that stark juxtaposition of my sighted and unsighted experience of the same places and the same cities within such a short period of time has given me all sorts of wonderful outsights of the city itself .
Paramount amongst those was the realization that , actually , cities are fantastic places for the blind .
And then I was also surprised by the city &apos;s propensity for kindness and care as opposed to indifference or worse .
And then I started to realize that it seemed like the blind seemed to have a positive influence on the city itself .
That was a little curious to me .
Let me step back and take a look at why the city is so good for the blind .
Inherent with the training for recovery from sight loss is learning to rely on all your non-visual senses , things that you would otherwise maybe ignore .
It &apos;s like a whole new world of sensory information opens up to you .
I was really struck by the symphony of subtle sounds all around me in the city that you can hear and work with to understand where you are , how you need to move , and where you need to go .
Similarly , just through the grip of the cane , you can feel contrasting textures in the floor below , and over time you build a pattern of where you are and where you &apos;re headed .
Similarly , just the sun warming one side of your face or the wind at your neck gives you clues about your alignment and your progression through a block and your movement through time and space .
But also , the sense of smell .
Some districts and cities have their own smell , as do places and things around you , and if you &apos;re lucky , you can even follow your nose to that new bakery that you &apos;ve been looking for .
All this really surprised me , because I started to realize that my unsighted experienced was so far more multi-sensory than my sighted experience ever was .
What struck me also was how much the city was changing around me .
When you &apos;re sighted , everybody kind of sticks to themselves , you mind your own business .
Lose your sight , though , and it &apos;s a whole other story .
And I don &apos;t know who &apos;s watching who , but I have a suspicion that a lot of people are watching me .
And I &apos;m not paranoid , but everywhere I go , I &apos;m getting all sorts of advice : Go here , move there , watch out for this .
A lot of the information is good .
Some of it &apos;s helpful . A lot of it &apos;s kind of reversed .
You &apos;ve got to figure out what they actually meant .
Some of it &apos;s kind of wrong and not helpful .
But it &apos;s all good in the grand scheme of things .
But one time I was in Oakland walking along Broadway , and came to a corner .
I was waiting for an audible pedestrian signal , and as it went off , I was just about to step out into the street , when all of a sudden , my right hand was just gripped by this guy , and he yanked my arm and pulled me out into the crosswalk and was dragging me out across the street , speaking to me in Mandarin .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s like , there was no escape from this man &apos;s death grip , but he got me safely there .
What could I do ?
But believe me , there are more polite ways to offer assistance .
We don &apos;t know you &apos;re there , so it &apos;s kind of nice to say &quot; &quot; Hello &quot; &quot; first .
&quot; Would you like some help ? &quot;
But while in Oakland , I &apos;ve really been struck by how much the city of Oakland changed as I lost my sight .
I liked it sighted . It was fine .
It &apos;s a perfectly great city .
But once I lost my sight and was walking along Broadway , I was blessed every block of the way .
&quot; Bless you , man . &quot;
&quot; Go for it , brother . &quot;
&quot; God bless you . &quot;
I didn &apos;t get that sighted .
( Laughter ) And even without sight , I don &apos;t get that in San Francisco .
And I know it bothers some of my blind friends , it &apos;s not just me .
Often it &apos;s thought that that &apos;s an emotion that comes up out of pity .
I tend to think that it comes out of our shared humanity , out of our togetherness , and I think it &apos;s pretty cool .
In fact , if I &apos;m feeling down , I just go to Broadway in downtown Oakland , I go for a walk , and I feel better like that , in no time at all .
But also that it illustrates how disability and blindness sort of cuts across ethnic , social , racial , economic lines .
Disability is an equal-opportunity provider .
Everybody &apos;s welcome .
In fact , I &apos;ve heard it said in the disability community that there are really only two types of people : There are those with disabilities , and there are those that haven &apos;t quite found theirs yet .
It &apos;s a different way of thinking about it , but I think it &apos;s kind of beautiful , because it is certainly far more inclusive than the us-versus-them or the abled-versus-the-disabled , and it &apos;s a lot more honest and respectful of the fragility of life .
So my final takeaway for you is that not only is the city good for the blind , but the city needs us .
And I &apos;m so sure of that that I want to propose to you today that the blind be taken as the prototypical city dwellers when imagining new and wonderful cities , and not the people that are thought about after the mold has already been cast .
It &apos;s too late then .
So if you design a city with the blind in mind , you &apos;ll have a rich , walkable network of sidewalks with a dense array of options and choices all available at the street level .
If you design a city with the blind in mind , sidewalks will be predictable and will be generous .
The space between buildings will be well-balanced between people and cars .
In fact , cars , who needs them ?
If you &apos;re blind , you don &apos;t drive . ( Laughter ) They don &apos;t like it when you drive . ( Laughter ) If you design a city with the blind in mind , you design a city with a robust , accessible , well-connected mass transit system that connects all parts of the city and the region all around . If you design a city with the blind in mind ,
there &apos;ll be jobs , lots of jobs .
Blind people want to work too .
They want to earn a living .
So , in designing a city for the blind , I hope you start to realize that it actually would be a more inclusive , a more equitable , a more just city for all .
And based on my prior sighted experience , it sounds like a pretty cool city , whether you &apos;re blind , whether you have a disability , or you haven &apos;t quite found yours yet .
So thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here to show you how something you can &apos;t see can be so much fun to look at .
You &apos;re about to experience a new , available and exciting technology that &apos;s going to make us rethink how we waterproof our lives .
What I have here is a cinder block that we &apos;ve coated half with a nanotechnology spray that can be applied to almost any material .
It &apos;s called Ultra-Ever Dry , and when you apply it to any material , it turns into a superhydrophobic shield .
So this is a cinder block , uncoated , and you can see that it &apos;s porous , it absorbs water .
Not anymore .
Porous , nonporous .
So what &apos;s superhydrophobic ?
Superhydrophobic is how we measure a drop of water on a surface .
The rounder it is , the more hydrophobic it is , and if it &apos;s really round , it &apos;s superhydrophobic .
A freshly waxed car , the water molecules slump to about 90 degrees .
A windshield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees .
But what you &apos;re seeing here is 160 to 175 degrees , and anything over 150 is superhydrophobic .
So as part of the demonstration , what I have is a pair of gloves , and we &apos;ve coated one of the gloves with the nanotechnology coating , and let &apos;s see if you can tell which one , and I &apos;ll give you a hint .
Did you guess the one that was dry ?
When you have nanotechnology and nanoscience , what &apos;s occurred is that we &apos;re able to now look at atoms and molecules and actually control them for great benefits .
And we &apos;re talking really small here .
The way you measure nanotechnology is in nanometers , and one nanometer is a billionth of a meter , and to put some scale to that , if you had a nanoparticle that was one nanometer thick , and you put it side by side , and you had 50,000 of them , you &apos;d be the width of a human hair .
So very small , but very useful .
And it &apos;s not just water that this works with .
It &apos;s a lot of water-based materials like concrete , water-based paint , mud , and also some refined oils as well .
You can see the difference .
Moving onto the next demonstration , we &apos;ve taken a pane of glass and we &apos;ve coated the outside of it , we &apos;ve framed it with the nanotechnology coating , and we &apos;re going to pour this green-tinted water inside the middle , and you &apos;re going to see , it &apos;s going to spread out on glass like you &apos;d normally think it would , except when it hits the coating , it stops , and I can &apos;t even coax it to leave .
It &apos;s that afraid of the water .
( Applause ) So what &apos;s going on here ? What &apos;s happening ?
Well , the surface of the spray coating is actually filled with nanoparticles that form a very rough and craggly surface .
You &apos;d think it &apos;d be smooth , but it &apos;s actually not .
And it has billions of interstitial spaces , and those spaces , along with the nanoparticles , reach up and grab the air molecules , and cover the surface with air .
It &apos;s an umbrella of air all across it , and that layer of air is what the water hits , the mud hits , the concrete hits , and it glides right off .
So if I put this inside this water here , you can see a silver reflective coating around it , and that silver reflective coating is the layer of air that &apos;s protecting the water from touching the paddle , and it &apos;s dry .
So what are the applications ?
I mean , many of you right now are probably going through your head .
Everyone that sees this gets excited , and says , &quot; Oh , I could use it for this and this and this . &quot;
The applications in a general sense could be anything that &apos;s anti-wetting .
We &apos;ve certainly seen that today .
It could be anything that &apos;s anti-icing , because if you don &apos;t have water , you don &apos;t have ice .
It could be anti-corrosion .
No water , no corrosion .
It could be anti-bacterial .
Without water , the bacteria won &apos;t survive .
And it could be things that need to be self-cleaning as well .
So imagine how something like this could help revolutionize your field of work .
And I &apos;m going to leave you with one last demonstration , but before I do that , I would like to say thank you , and think small .
( Applause ) It &apos;s going to happen . Wait for it . Wait for it .
Chris Anderson : You guys didn &apos;t hear about us cutting out the Design from TED ? ( Laughter ) &#91; Two minutes later ... &#93; He ran into all sorts of problems in terms of managing the medical research part .
It &apos;s happening !

My favorite topic is shortcuts .
The master of shortcuts — it &apos;s , of course , nature .
But I will demonstrate different ways to get rid of difficulties and go to the point , to find an answer probably much quicker than Arthur did . So , first , we violate the common sense , the logic . All of you , if you hold your hand like this , 90 degrees — all of you . Not you .
All of you , right ? Palm up .
If you do this , the common , the logic says you must turn the wrist .
Do you agree ?
Good .
But I will first teach you a method , how you can do it without moving the wrist , and then the shortcut .
You can do it immediately , right ?
Hold the hand like this , palm up .
Don &apos;t move the wrist . The wrist is — I doesn &apos;t speak very many , but I do the best , what I are .
Right-molded you say , with iron ?
That was a joke , actually , and I — OK .
Hold the hand palm up . Do this , don &apos;t move the wrist .
Over the heart , don &apos;t move the wrist .
Forward , don &apos;t move the wrist .
Up , don &apos;t move the wrist . Over the heart , don &apos;t move the wrist .
And forward . Yeah .
Now — ( Laughter ) — logic , logically , you have got to this position from this , without moving the wrist . ( Laughter )
Now , the shortcut . ( Laughter )
But it was six moves . Now with one move .
I start here , palm down , you can follow .
And then look at me .
Yeah ! ( Laughter ) One move . OK .
So , that was the warming up .
Now , I need an assistant .
I talked to a nice girl before , Zoe .
She has left . No ! A big hand .
( Applause ) Good . Nice . And you can sit over there .
One item here was water , right ?
And I will give my tribute to water .
I think it &apos;s enough with water for me . The other guys can talk about — cheers .
( Laughter ) Beer has about — there &apos;s a lot of water in beer . ( Laughter )
So , now I will demonstrate different ways of memorizing , control cards and so on .
And I think I &apos;ll take off this one .
I work with a special method to do it , quick . I work with
precision — oh , sorry — control and a very powerful ...
memory system , right ?
( Laughter ) So , if — I have studied the poker . I like to gamble .
Officially , I don &apos;t gamble but ...
So , if we are — if we have five person , and I will do a five-handed poker game .
Now I will interact . So a different person all the time , so not the same person can answer .
So we have an agreement .
Which one shall have a good poker hand ?
Which number ? One , two , three , four or five ? ( Audience : Three . ) Lennart Green : Three — good .
And here , I had a mat here to make it a little — the critical moment is — sorry .
If a card shark gathers the cards together , immediately when he — before he deals the card . Now , so I think , number three , I have arranged them in a full house .
( Laughter ) With queens and — it &apos;s OK — queens and tens .
That &apos;s a challenge . I like this .
I will explain later . One , two , three , four , five .
I start with three queens .
So here you see the contrast when I treat the cards .
And two tens .
Yeah . Thank you .
( Applause ) But also the other hand is good , if all the other guys have good hands too .
So these guys have actually a stronger hand — three aces and two kings .
This guy beats them with four of a kind , or deuce — deuce .
No reaction ? That with even — OK , and this .
These look in order , I &apos;m probably — hopefully — yeah . Three , four , five , six , seven and ...
But , of course , I will have the winning hand .
Ten , jack , queen , king , ace .
Yeah . So , good .
( Laughter ) So the hand that looks so good from the beginning , number three , at the end was actually the lowest hand .
Such life . Right ?
So , please mix them .
Now , if you are interested , I will demonstrate some underground techniques .
Yes ?
I work with kind of estimation , shuffle tracking — ah , good .
Impressive . Thank you .
( Laughter ) So , first , the first term is estimation .
Here , I can estimate exactly how many cards are put between my royal flush .
Of course , I can count the cards , but this is much quicker .
Right ? You agree .
So here I have , actually — I know exactly where the cards are .
So here , I can make a bet , and this is actually one of the points where I get my money .
So here : 10 , jack , queen , king , ace .
OK .
( Applause ) Next is a term — I do it quick . I call this stealing .
So here , I think I know about where the cards are .
I will spread the cards and you &apos;ll say stop , when I point to them , right . Point , say stop .
Zoe : Stop .
LG : Here — you see some are missing ?
And that &apos;s the stealing cards , which I did .
( Laughter ) OK .
Now , another term called shuffle tracking .
Shuffle tracking means I keep track of the cards , even if another person shuffles .
This is a little risky .
So — because if you look , now , I can still see it .
You agree ? But if you square — square , and shuffle , and then a cut .
So here , to follow my cards , I must look at the shuffle from the begin — ah , we are started together . It &apos;s OK , it &apos;s OK .
Come to — no , no , no , no .
I &apos;m joking , yeah ?
Any style — yeah , good .
Here I have to calculate , but actually , I don &apos;t like to calculate .
I work direct with the right brain .
If you pass the left brain , you have to take care of logic and common sense .
Direct in the right brain , that &apos;s much better . And so — ( Laughter ) — Arthur Benjamin did a little of the same thing .
And if you work with , in the right atmosphere , with humor , you have — that &apos;s the password to the cosmic bank of knowledge , where you can find any solution of any problem .
OK . Now , I drop the cards , and you say stop anyway , right ?
Not at the last card .
Zoe : Stop . LG : Yeah .
When I &apos;m sober , I do this much quicker , but we will check .
( Laughter ) Ah , not in order , it — that was a mistake .
No , I &apos;m kidding .
( Applause ) No , now and then I put in a mistake , just to emphasize how difficult it is .
Right ?
Yeah , last night I forgot that . That was a mistake .
But now I &apos;m glad I remember it .
So , this deck is bought here . Sorry .
I have a little pad to make it a little softer .
This deck is bought here in America .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Bicycle . &quot; &quot; And this deck is very flexible , but not so many people know , if you check , if you press at the right spots , you see how thin and flexible this deck is , right ?
Now , you can carry this in your wallet , so ...
You don &apos;t see it , make no reaction ?
( Laughter ) So , but here , and — is the camera getting too much ? No . ( Laughter )
Yeah ? ( Audience : It &apos;s getting too much . ) LG : Pardon ? But then , when we will have it back , you do this .
But not too much .
Then you have to push it down again .
Here , please . If you push these heaps — everyone see — push them together so they are really interlaced , right ? Yeah , good .
Perfect .
Just push them through , good . Thank you .
And then , I will demonstrate a thing from Russian satellite , stealen — stolen , probably copied from America but we will see .
Here — shortcuts . I talk about shortcuts .
Now I go very quick through the deck and try to find some pattern .
The new chaos theory is already old , right ?
But you know , I think you are familiar with fractals — the Mandelbrot spirals and all these things .
And it &apos;s much easier to memorize cards in a pattern way , and not concentrate . If you concentrate and calculate , then you go to — then it &apos;s the left brain . But if you just look and talk in another language ...
Yeah , great .
I think I have it .
So now , different persons , older , tap .
Please name any card , anyone .
( Audience : Jack of spades . ) LG : Jack of spades . Jack of spades .
I think jack of spades is number 12 from the top . One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight ,
nine , 10 , 11 , 12 . Yes , right .
So — oh , jack of spades .
You said spades ? ( Audience : Yes . ) LG : Ah .
My fault . Don &apos;t applaud , this was clubs .
So , jack of spades .
I think ...
23 — 24 , sorry , 24 .
One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 — ah , 25 , yes .
It &apos;s the last .
Now , I do it quicker , better .
OK . Another person . Oh , I forgot , I shouldn &apos;t shuffle but I think — ( Laughter ) — actually , my technique is to peek , all the time .
When I lift the heap , I peek .
You see , yeah , perfect .
Three , four , five , six . Then I calculate — yeah , good .
( Laughter ) Another person , another card . ( Audience : Seven of diamonds . ) LG : Seven of diamonds . Perfect , my favorite , yeah , seven .
So I will do it quick , very quick , but in slow motion , so you can follow .
( Laughter ) Seven of ? ( Audience : Diamonds . ) LG : Diamonds , good . I start here .
Good , thank you .
( Applause ) The thing I did — I peeked .
I know where the card were , then I chose it . So another person , another card .
( Laughter ) Another person .
( Audience : Ten of diamonds . ) LG : Pardon ? ( Audience : Ten of diamonds . )
LG : Ten of diamonds , yeah .
I think I do it the same way . I like to , so I know where it is .
Ten of diamonds .
But now I do it the regular speed , right ?
Ten of diamonds .
Good .
Maybe you will cut ? Lift .
Excellent .
So , thank you . Another person , another card .
( Audience : Five of clubs . ) LG : Pardon ? ( Audience : Five of clubs . ) LG : Five of clubs . It &apos;s not the same person , even if it &apos;s the same spot .
We can take some over there later . So now , I will drop the cards .
And you &apos;ll say stop , anywhere . Got it ?
Five of clubs .
Not the last . Yes , that &apos;s difficult to find a card here .
( Laughter ) We do it again .
The person who said five of clubs say stop , when the cards are in the air , right ?
( Audience : Stop . ) LG : Very good .
OK .
( Applause ) OK , I had to use a little force there .
I think we save five of clubs .
And now a card with a contrast of five of clubs .
( Audience : Queen of hearts . ) LG : Queen of hearts , yeah .
Excellent . I love that card .
Here , I will do the most difficult thing .
For example , you are sitting in Las Vegas , and you &apos;re betting , and you let the other guys peek this card by mistake . Feel , it &apos;s just the regular , one card .
And now , when I lift this card , it shall be your card . What was your card ?
( Audience : Queen of hearts . ) LG : Queen of ? Queen of hearts .
So that &apos;s a tough challenge , right ?
So here , I grab — you know this ? Five of clubs ...
and queen of hearts . Yes !
This is a tough one , because here I must take advantage of — I switch it with the five of clubs .
So , now a false count .
Which card shall I use ? Queen or five ?
Zoe : The queen . LG : Queen , yes .
So , I use the queen , and here &apos;s five of clubs .
The false count — and the number one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight — you say the same card all the time .
Eight , nine , 10 .
This is a kind of optical deal , right ?
When I put one card at a table — look , it &apos;s not one card . It &apos;s — look , it &apos;s a bunch of cards that gives this impression .
Yeah .
Now some hard stuff .
I think we keep the queen here , yes .
Now , to the satellites things .
This — oh sorry , don &apos;t look at the beam . My fault .
( Laughter ) This is high-frequency laser , and it &apos;s enough with a fraction of a second to destroy the retina completely .
Right , sorry , my — I should have mentioned that , yeah .
But you can relax , because it takes half an hour before it works , so you have plenty of time to see my whole performance .
( Laughter ) Now , I put the laser here , and — now , when I deal the cards in the laser , I know where they are but — yes ?
Did the camera got it ?
No ?
They didn &apos;t ?
What happened ?
( Audience : It disappeared . ) LG : OK , I &apos;ll take another group .
Do the cameras see the cards now ?
No ? ( Audience : No , they &apos;re all gone . ) LG : But you see the hand .
Ah , good , good , good . But now .
So now , that was the reason , right ?
You see the cards ? Yes .
( Laughter ) Yeah , good .
Now — ( Laughter ) — one guy laughed . So now , to find the queen , do it this way : take back the other one , take back the queen . ( Laughter )
Yeah , interesting , but a little dangerous . ( Laughter )
I liked it . Now , a little more difficult .
Name — anyone , name , please , any suit .
( Audience : Spades . ) LG : Spades ? Spades , good .
So here , here I have to peek , lots of cards .
I think there are lots of — I don &apos;t know how many — but 10 , 15 spades in a deck , at least , right ?
( Laughter ) So every time I lift the heap , I peek , right .
Then I arrange them so I can get them quick .
Perfect , excellent .
So I start with the ace — yeah , ace . Ah , yeah — spades ?
Same mistake as before , right ?
So — I arrange the spades — the clubs .
I try to do this right here . First , I take the spades .
You see , I don &apos;t work with prestige , so always do mistakes .
It doesn &apos;t matter to me .
And now and then , I get some extra sympathy points , right ?
One , two , three , four — yes , the camera got it ? Five , six , seven , eight — ah — nine , 10 , the jack , jack of spades , queen of — I like that laugh , yeah ! Good . Queen .
( Laughter ) Wait , wait , wait — please take any card .
Grab any one . Quick , quick , good .
And we switch this to the king .
Ace of diamonds .
And now , look , ace of diamonds will guide .
So I find ...
king of spades .
There was the place . And here is king of spades , correct ?
Yeah ? OK .
( Applause ) Now , a little more difficult thing .
Maybe you think I have the cards in order already , so you help me to shuffle again .
Another suit , please .
( Audience : Armani . ) LG : Pardon ? ( Audience : Armani . ) ( Laughter ) LG : It was after the blindfold .
I like this guy , yeah .
OK . That should be my end effect , but OK .
Armani — who said Armani ? You ?
I drop the cards and you — which size ?
Which size ? It &apos;s a piece of cake . I like challenges . Which size ?
( Audience : Extra large . ) LG : Extra large , OK . Say stop . ( Audience : Stop . )
( Laughter ) LG : Yeah , Armani . OK .
( Applause ) Ah , this is tough .
OK , a suit . I had clubs before , spades .
Another suit . ( Audience : Diamonds . ) LG : Diamonds , perfect .
So , in this case , I try to locate diamonds . I look at the cards , and OK .
We try . Yeah . You help me .
If I drop the card face up , like this , you reverse it . Zoe : OK .
LG : OK , now .
Do with both hands , and quick . Yes , good , good .
( Laughter ) I think we have it now . Yeah , good , good .
So here , diamonds , hearts — no , diamonds . Good , good .
Stop . Do you see the pattern ?
No ? Now ?
Yes , yes , OK .
I work with pattern .
Oh sorry , I dropped one .
Maybe it &apos;s important — yeah — nine of diamonds , OK .
So now — I always ask , why do I put myself in this position ?
I have to figure out so many outs , when I miss some cards , but I love it . So now , I will do it . I will try to find the diamonds , but I will do it the hard way .
It &apos;s too easy to do it right away , right ?
I think I will do it ...
blindfolded .
At this distance , it works immediately .
Aargh !
( Laughter ) Duct tape .
I look — shake the cards , so I don &apos;t .
Go ahead . Yeah , good . I like the empathy .
Empathy .
But it was — did you hear ?
It was women &apos;s voice . Hear the guy — yeah , more , more , more .
( Laughter ) Yeah , good . Yeah .
You can take the nostril too , because some guys think — ( Laughter ) — some guys think I can peek through the nostril , so do more . Go , go .
Right ? Good .
Satisfied ?
Looks good , like Batman . Ow !
( Laughter ) No , with dignity and elegance , right ?
But I like her , yeah . I said , be a little tough .
And it was OK . One more ?
The last .
OK .
All right .
Now you must agree that I &apos;m — I must rely on other senses , right ?
I work with vibration .
So , what was the card ?
Diamonds . Ah , I memorized hearts .
So now I have to improvise again .
Maybe I &apos;ll stand up . Half .
Diamonds — I &apos;ll start with ace of diamonds .
Just kidding , warming up — king of hearts .
( Laughter ) And I give you a diamonds , so they — so you put them here , in a nice row , right . And you can see , yeah ? Good .
Ace of diamonds , yes ? Zoe : Yeah .
LG : Good . Good . Two — ( Applause ) — thank you .
I never ever miss two . This is interesting .
Always I &apos;ve found two , but the wrong color . Spades , sorry .
And the deck is a gift to you after , so let the skepticals here , in this , examine them , right ? Remind me . It &apos;s a gift .
Two — and it was two of spades , right ?
Sorry , two of diamonds . I &apos;ll do it quick now .
Three — three of diamonds . Yes !
Four — I like challenges , yes .
Yeah , good .
Chris Anderson : You &apos;re peeking .
LG : Pardon ?
CA : You &apos;re peeking . You just got to — this is a request from the lady in the back .
( Laughter ) Okay .
Try that .
LG : Yeah . Also listen .
OK , now .
This is maybe a little tough .
We will try .
Yes ? Good ?
( Laughter ) OK . So , how many cards ? Five ? Zoe : Four .
LG : Four . Is five the next card ?
Zoe : Five of diamonds , yeah .
LG : It &apos;s not here ? Zoe : It &apos;s not there .
LG : Oh .
So here , all the cards are face down — you agree ? ( Audience : Yes . ) LG : Yes ? You see that in the screen ?
And this is face up , and it &apos;s not at the bottom here .
So next card will be — was it five ?
Zoe : Five . LG : Yeah — I will reverse it face up here .
Yes ? Zoe : Yeah .
LG : Six — six with the thumb .
Seven .
Yeah , I do this . I know where it is , because I peeked before and then I do this .
Right ?
Eight .
If — and then nine , right ?
Yeah .
Yesterday — the day before yesterday , I was in Vegas , and I used this actually .
Nine ? Yeah ? Correct ?
No ? Yes ! Ah , good , good .
Ten — once again , I love this Jonny Wayne move .
Yeah . Jack — you &#91; unclear &#93; with Jack ? Jack
of diamonds , correct ? ( Audience : No . ) LG : Yes ?
And queen ! Queen , with misdirection .
Misdirection . ( Applause ) Yeah ?
And then , king , after exactly five seconds .
Yeah . Five . Five seconds .
One , two , three , four — mmm !
Check it .
Yes ?
CA : King of diamonds . LG : Ah !
Good . Oh .
Touch me , feel — ah , ah , you know !
CA : Ladies and gentlemen , Lennart Green ! LG : Okay , thank you .
I wanna start today — here &apos;s my thing . Hold on . There I go .
Hey . I wanna start today — talk about the structure of a polypeptide . ( Laughter ) I get a lot of people asking me , in terms of &quot; &quot; Lost , &quot; &quot; you know , &quot; &quot; What the hell &apos;s that island ? &quot; &quot; You know , it &apos;s usually followed by , &quot; No , seriously , what the hell is that island ? &quot; ( Laughter )
Why so many mysteries ? What is it about mystery that I seem to be drawn to ?
And I was thinking about this , what to talk about at TED .
When I talked to the kind rep from TED , and I said , &quot; Listen , you know , what should I talk about ? &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry about it . Just be profound . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I took enormous comfort in that .
So thank you , if you &apos;re here .
I was trying to think , what do I talk about ? It &apos;s a good question .
Why do I do so much stuff that involves mystery ? And I started trying to figure it out .
And I started thinking about why do I do any of what I do , and I started thinking about my grandfather .
I loved my grandfather . Harry Kelvin was his name , my mother &apos;s father . He died in 1986 . He was an amazing guy .
And one of the reasons he was amazing : After World War II he began an electronics company .
He started selling surplus parts , kits , to schools and stuff .
So he had this incredible curiosity . As a kid I saw him come over to me with radios and telephones and all sorts of things .
And he &apos;d open them up , he &apos;d unscrew them , and reveal the inner workings — which many of us , I &apos;m sure , take for granted .
But it &apos;s an amazing gift to give a kid .
To open up this thing and show how it works and why it works and what it is .
He was the ultimate deconstructer , in many ways .
And my grandfather was a kind of guy who would not only take things apart , but he got me interested in all sorts of different odd crafts , like , you know , printing , like the letter press . I &apos;m obsessed with printing .
I &apos;m obsessed with silk screening and bookbinding and box making .
When I was a kid , I was always , like , taking apart boxes and stuff .
And last night in the hotel , I took apart the Kleenex box .
I was just looking at it . And I &apos;m telling you ... ( Laughter ) It &apos;s a beautiful thing .
I swear to God . I mean , when you look at the box , and you sort of see how it works .
Rives is here , and I met him years ago at a book fair ; he does pop-up books .
And I &apos;m obsessed with , like , engineering of paper .
But like , the scoring of it , the printing of it , where the thing gets glued , you know , the registration marks for the ink . I just love boxes .
My grandfather was sort of the guy who , you know , kind of got me into all sorts of these things .
He would also supply me with tools .
He was this amazing encourager — this patron , sort of , to make stuff .
And he got me a Super 8 camera when I was 10 years old .
And in 1976 , that was sort of an anomaly , to be a 10-year-old kid that had access to a camera .
And you know , he was so generous ; I couldn &apos;t believe it .
He wasn &apos;t doing it entirely without some manipulation .
I mean , I would call him , and I &apos;d be like , &quot; &quot; Listen , Grandpa , I really need this camera .
You don &apos;t understand . This is , like , you know , I want to make movies .
I &apos;ll get invited to TED one day . This is like — &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And you know , and my grandmother was the greatest .
Because she &apos;d be like , you know — she &apos;d get on the phone .
She &apos;d be like , &quot; &quot; Harry , it &apos;s better than the drugs . He should be doing — &quot; &quot; She was fantastic . ( Laughter ) So I found myself getting this stuff , thanks to her assist , and suddenly , you know , I had a synthesizer when I was 14 years old — this kind of stuff .
And it let me make things , which , to me , was sort of the dream .
He sort of humored my obsession to other things too , like magic .
The thing is , we &apos;d go to this magic store in New York City called Lou Tannen &apos;s Magic .
It was this great magic store . It was a crappy little building in Midtown , but you &apos;d be in the elevator , the elevator would open — there &apos;d be this little , small magic store . You &apos;d be in the magic store .
And it was just , it was a magical place .
So I got all these sort of magic tricks . Oh , here . I &apos;ll show you .
This is the kind of thing . So it would be like , you know . Right ?
Which is good , but now I can &apos;t move .
Now , I have to do this , the rest of the thing , like this .
I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Oh , wow . Look at my computer over there ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Anyway , so one of the things that I bought at the magic store was this : Tannen &apos;s Mystery Magic Box .
The premise behind the mystery magic box was the following : 15 dollars buys you 50 dollars worth of magic .
Which is a savings . ( Laughter ) Now , I bought this decades ago and I &apos;m not kidding .
If you look at this , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s never been opened .
But I &apos;ve had this forever .
Now , I was looking at this , it was in my office , as it always is , on the shelf , and I was thinking , why have I not opened this ?
And why have I kept it ? Because I &apos;m not a pack rat . I don &apos;t keep everything but for some reason I haven &apos;t opened this box .
And I felt like there was a key to this , somehow , in talking about something at TED that I haven &apos;t discussed before , and bored people elsewhere .
So I thought , maybe there &apos;s something with this . I started thinking about it .
And there was this giant question mark . I love the design , for what it &apos;s worth , of this thing . And I started thinking , why haven &apos;t I opened it ?
And I realized that I haven &apos;t opened it because it represents something important — to me . It represents my grandfather .
Am I allowed to cry at TED ? Because — no , I &apos;m not going to cry . But — ( Laughter ) — the thing is , that it represents infinite possibility .
It represents hope . It represents potential .
And what I love about this box , and what I realize I sort of do in whatever it is that I do , is I find myself drawn to infinite possibility , that sense of potential .
And I realize that mystery is the catalyst for imagination .
Now , it &apos;s not the most ground-breaking idea , but when I started to think that maybe there are times when mystery is more important than knowledge , I started getting interested in this .
And so I started thinking about &quot; &quot; Lost , &quot; &quot; and the stuff that we do , and I realized , oh my God , mystery boxes are everywhere in what I do !
In how — in the creation of &quot; &quot; Lost , &quot; &quot; Damon Lindelof and I , who created the show with me , we were basically tasked with creating this series that we had very little time to do . We had 11 and a half weeks to write it , cast it , crew it , shoot it , cut it , post it , turn in a two-hour pilot .
So it was not a lot of time . And that sense of possibility — what could this thing be ?
There was no time to develop it .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re all familiar with those people who tell you what you can &apos;t do and what you should change .
And there was no time for that , which is kind of amazing .
And so we did this show , and for those of you who , you know , who haven &apos;t seen it , or don &apos;t know it , I can show you this one little clip from the pilot , just to show you some stuff that we did .
Claire : Help ! Please help me ! Help me ! Help me !
Jack : Get him out of here ! Get him away from the engine ! Get him out of here !
C : I &apos;m having contractions !
J : How many months pregnant are you ?
C : I &apos;m only eight months .
J : And how far apart are they coming ?
C : I don &apos;t know . I think it just happened .
Man : Hey ! Hey ! Hey , get away from — JJA : Now , 10 years ago , if we wanted to do that , we &apos;d have to kill a stuntman .
We &apos;d actually — ( Laughter ) it would be harder . It would take — Take 2 would be a bitch .
So the amazing thing was , we were able to do this thing .
And part of that was the amazing availability of technology , knowing we could do anything . I mean , we could never have done that .
We might have been able to write it ; we wouldn &apos;t have been able to depict it like we did . And so part of the amazing thing for me is in the creative process , technology is , like , mind-blowingly inspiring to me .
I realize that that blank page is a magic box , you know ?
It needs to be filled with something fantastic .
I used to have the &quot; &quot; Ordinary People &quot; &quot; script that I &apos;d flip through .
The romance of the script was amazing to me ; it would inspire me .
I wanted to try and fill pages with the same kind of spirit and thought and emotion that that script did .
You know , I love Apple computers . I &apos;m obsessed .
So the Apple computer — like those — the PowerBook — this computer , right , it challenges me . It basically says , what are you going to write worthy of me ? ( Laughter ) I guess I feel this — I &apos;m compelled .
And I often am like , you know , dude , today I &apos;m out . I got nothing . You know ? ( Laughter ) So there &apos;s that . In terms of the content of it , you look at stories , you think , well , what are stories but mystery boxes ?
There &apos;s a fundamental question — in TV , the first act is called the teaser .
It &apos;s literally the teaser . It &apos;s the big question .
So you &apos;re drawn into it . Then of course , there &apos;s another question . And it goes on and on .
Look at &quot; &quot; Star Wars . &quot; &quot; You got the droids ; they meet the mysterious woman .
Who &apos;s that ? We don &apos;t know . Mystery box ! You know ?
Then you meet Luke Skywalker . He gets the Droid , you see the holographic image .
You learn , oh , it &apos;s a message , you know .
She wants to , you know , find Obi Wan Kenobi . He &apos;s her only hope .
But who the hell &apos;s Obi Wan Kenobi ? Mystery box !
So then you go and he meets Ben Kenobi . Ben Kenobi is Obi Wan Kenobi .
Holy shit ! You know — so it keeps us — ( Laughter ) — have you guys not seen that ?
( Laughter ) It &apos;s huge ! Anyway — So there &apos;s this thing with mystery boxes that I started feeling compelled .
Then there &apos;s the thing of mystery in terms of imagination — the withholding of information . You know , doing that intentionally is much more engaging .
Whether it &apos;s like the shark in &quot; &quot; Jaws &quot; &quot; — if Spielberg &apos;s mechanical shark , Bruce , had worked , it would not be remotely as scary ; you would have seen it too much .
In &quot; &quot; Alien &quot; &quot; , they never really showed the alien : terrifying !
Even in a movie , like a romantic comedy , &quot; &quot; The Graduate , &quot; &quot; they &apos;re having that date , remember ?
And they &apos;re in the car , and it &apos;s loud , and so they put the top up .
They &apos;re in there — you don &apos;t hear anything they &apos;re saying ! You can &apos;t hear a word !
But it &apos;s the most romantic date ever . And you love it because you don &apos;t hear it .
So to me , there &apos;s that .
And then , finally , there &apos;s this idea — stretching the sort of paradigm a little bit — but the idea of the mystery box .
Meaning , what you think you &apos;re getting , then what you &apos;re really getting .
And it &apos;s true in so many movies and stories .
And when you look at &quot; &quot; E.T. , &quot; &quot; for example — &quot; &quot; E.T. &quot; &quot; is this , you know , unbelievable movie about what ? It &apos;s about an alien who meets a kid , right ?
Well , it &apos;s not . &quot; &quot; E.T. &quot; &quot; is about divorce . &quot; &quot; E.T. &quot; &quot; is about a heartbroken , divorce-crippled family , and ultimately , this kid who can &apos;t find his way .
&quot; &quot; Die Hard , &quot; &quot; right ? Crazy , great , fun , action-adventure movie in a building .
It &apos;s about a guy who &apos;s on the verge of divorce .
He &apos;s showing up to L.A. , tail between his legs .
There are great scenes — maybe not the most amazing dramatic scenes in the history of time , but pretty great scenes .
There &apos;s a half an hour of investment in character before you get to the stuff that you &apos;re , you know , expecting .
When you look at a movie like &quot; &quot; Jaws , &quot; &quot; the scene that you expect — we have the screen ?
These are the kind of , you know , scenes that you remember and expect from &quot; &quot; Jaws . &quot; &quot; And she &apos;s being eaten ; there &apos;s a shark .
The thing about &quot; &quot; Jaws &quot; &quot; is , it &apos;s really about a guy who is sort of dealing with his place in the world — with his masculinity , with his family , how he &apos;s going to , you know , make it work in this new town .
This is one of my favorite scenes ever , and this is a scene that you wouldn &apos;t necessarily think of when you think of &quot; &quot; Jaws . &quot; &quot; But it &apos;s an amazing scene .
Father : C &apos;mere . Give us a kiss .
Son : Why ?
Father : &apos; Cause I need it .
JJA : C &apos;mon . &quot; &quot; Why ? &apos; Cause I need it ? &quot; &quot; Best scene ever , right ?
Come on ! So you think of &quot; &quot; Jaws &quot; &quot; — so that &apos;s the kind of stuff that , like , you know , the investment of character , which is the stuff that really is inside the box , you know ?
It &apos;s why when people do sequels , or rip off movies , you know , of a genre , they &apos;re ripping off the wrong thing .
You &apos;re not supposed to rip off the shark or the monster .
You gotta rip off — you know , if you rip something off — rip off the character .
Rip off the stuff that matters . I mean , look inside yourself and figure out what is inside you .
Because ultimately , you know , the mystery box is all of us . So there &apos;s that .
Then the distribution . What &apos;s a bigger mystery box than a movie theater ?
You know ? You go to the theater , you &apos;re just so excited to see anything .
The moment the lights go down is often the best part , you know ?
And you &apos;re full of that amazing — that feeling of excited anticipation .
And often , the movie &apos;s , like , there and it &apos;s going , and then something happens and you go , &quot; &quot; Oh — &quot; &quot; and then something else , and you &apos;re , &quot; &quot; Mmm ... &quot; &quot; Now , when it &apos;s a great movie , you &apos;re along for the ride &apos; cause you &apos;re willing to give yourself to it .
So to me , whether it &apos;s that , whether it &apos;s a TV , an iPod , computer , cell phone — it &apos;s funny , I &apos;m an — as I said , Apple fanatic — and one day , about a year or so ago , I was signing on online in the morning to watch Steve Jobs &apos; keynote , &apos; cause I always do . And he came on , he was presenting the video iPod , and what was on the enormous iPod behind him ?
&quot; &quot; Lost &quot; &quot; ! I had no idea ! And I realized , holy shit , it &apos;d come full circle .
Like , the inspiration I get from the technology is now using the stuff that I do , inspired by it , to sell technology . I mean , it &apos;s nuts ! ( Laughter ) I was gonna show you a couple of other things I &apos;m gonna skip through .
I just want to show you one other thing that has nothing to do with anything .
This is something online ; I don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve seen it before .
Six years ago they did this . This is an online thing done by guys who had some visual effects experience . But the point was , that they were doing things that were using these mystery boxes that they had — everyone has now .
What I &apos;ve realized is what my grandfather did for me when I was a kid , everyone has access to now .
You don &apos;t need to have my grandfather , though you wished you had .
But I have to tell you — this is a guy doing stuff on a Quadra 950 computer — the resolution &apos;s a little bit low — using Infinity software they stopped making 15 years ago .
He &apos;s doing stuff that looks as amazing as stuff I &apos;ve seen released from Hollywood .
The most incredible sort of mystery , I think , is now the question of what comes next .
Because it is now democratized . So now , the creation of media is — it &apos;s everywhere .
The stuff that I was lucky and begging for to get when I was a kid is now ubiquitous .
And so , there &apos;s an amazing sense of opportunity out there .
And when I think of the filmmakers who exist out there now who would have been silenced , you know — who have been silenced in the past — it &apos;s a very exciting thing .
I used to say in classes and lectures and stuff , to someone who wants to write , &quot; &quot; Go ! Write ! Do your thing . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s free , you know , you don &apos;t need permission to go write . But now I can say , &quot; &quot; Go make your movie ! &quot; &quot; There &apos;s nothing stopping you from going out there and getting the technology .
You can lease , rent , buy stuff off the shelf that is either as good , or just as good , as the stuff that &apos;s being used by the , you know , quote unquote &quot; &quot; legit people . &quot; &quot; No community is best served when only the elite have control .
And I feel like this is an amazing opportunity to see what else is out there .
When I did &quot; &quot; Mission : Impossible III , &quot; &quot; we had amazing visual effects stuff .
ILM did the effects ; it was incredible .
And sort of like my dream to be involved .
And there are a couple of sequences in the movie , like these couple of moments I &apos;ll show you .
There &apos;s that .
Okay , obviously I have an obsession with big crazy explosions .
So my favorite visual effect in the movie is the one I &apos;m about to show you .
And it &apos;s a scene in which Tom &apos;s character wakes up . He &apos;s drowsy . He &apos;s crazy — out of it . And the guy wakes up , and he shoves this gun in his nose and shoots this little capsule into his brain that he &apos;s going to use later to kill him , as bad guys do .
Bad Guy : Good morning .
JJA : OK , now . When we shot that scene , we were there doing it , the actor who had the gun , an English actor , Eddie Marsan — sweetheart , great guy — he kept taking the gun and putting it into Tom &apos;s nose , and it was hurting Tom &apos;s nose .
And I learned this very early on in my career : Don &apos;t hurt Tom &apos;s nose . ( Laughter ) There are three things you don &apos;t want to do . Number two is : Don &apos;t hurt Tom &apos;s nose .
So Eddie has this gun — and he &apos;s the greatest guy — he &apos;s this really sweet English guy . He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Sorry , I don &apos;t want to hurt you . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like — you gotta — we have to make this look good .
And I realized that we had to do something &apos; cause it wasn &apos;t working just as it was .
And I literally , like , thought back to what I would have done using the Super 8 camera that my grandfather got me sitting in that room , and I realized that hand didn &apos;t have to be Eddie Marsan &apos;s . It could be Tom &apos;s .
And Tom would know just how hard to push the gun . He wouldn &apos;t hurt himself .
So we took his hand and we painted it to look a little bit more like Eddie &apos;s .
We put it in Eddie &apos;s sleeve , and so the hand that you see — I &apos;ll show you again , that &apos;s not Eddie &apos;s hand , that &apos;s Tom &apos;s .
So Tom is playing two roles . ( Laughter ) And he didn &apos;t ask for any more money .
So here , here . Watch it again .
There he is . He &apos;s waking up . He &apos;s drowsy , been through a lot .
Tom &apos;s hand . Tom &apos;s hand . Tom &apos;s hand . ( Laughter ) Anyway .
So .
( Applause ) Thanks .
So you don &apos;t need the greatest technology to do things that can work in movies .
And the mystery box , in honor of my grandfather , stays closed .
Thank you . ( Applause )
June 29 , 2016 .
And here are the dietary factors going head-to-head against these drugs .
Do you recommend pursuing these treatments now , for most cancer patients ?
The Angiogenesis Foundation is following almost 300 companies , and there are about 100 more drugs in that pipeline .
Right now you have a movie playing inside your head .
It &apos;s an amazing multi-track movie .
It has 3D vision and surround sound for what you &apos;re seeing and hearing right now , but that &apos;s just the start of it .
Your movie has smell and taste and touch .
It has a sense of your body , pain , hunger , orgasms .
It has emotions , anger and happiness .
It has memories , like scenes from your childhood playing before you .
And it has this constant voiceover narrative in your stream of conscious thinking .
At the heart of this movie is you experiencing all this directly .
Consciousness is one of the fundamental facts of human existence .
Each of us is conscious .
We all have our own inner movie , you and you and you .
There &apos;s nothing we know about more directly .
At least , I know about my consciousness directly .
I can &apos;t be certain that you guys are conscious .
Consciousness also is what makes life worth living .
If we weren &apos;t conscious , nothing in our lives would have meaning or value .
But at the same time , it &apos;s the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe .
Why are we conscious ?
Why do we have these inner movies ?
Why aren &apos;t we just robots who process all this input , produce all that output , without experiencing the inner movie at all ?
Right now , nobody knows the answers to those questions .
I &apos;m going to suggest that to integrate consciousness into science , some radical ideas may be needed .
Some people say a science of consciousness is impossible .
Science , by its nature , is objective .
Consciousness , by its nature , is subjective .
So there can never be a science of consciousness .
For much of the 20th century , that view held sway .
Psychologists studied behavior objectively , neuroscientists studied the brain objectively , and nobody even mentioned consciousness .
Even 30 years ago , when TED got started , there was very little scientific work on consciousness .
Now , about 20 years ago , all that began to change .
Neuroscientists like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger Penrose said now is the time for science to attack consciousness .
And since then , there &apos;s been a real explosion , a flowering of scientific work on consciousness .
And this work has been wonderful . It &apos;s been great .
But it also has some fundamental limitations so far .
The centerpiece of the science of consciousness in recent years has been the search for correlations , correlations between certain areas of the brain and certain states of consciousness .
We saw some of this kind of work from Nancy Kanwisher and the wonderful work she presented just a few minutes ago .
Now we understand much better , for example , the kinds of brain areas that go along with the conscious experience of seeing faces or of feeling pain or of feeling happy .
But this is still a science of correlations .
It &apos;s not a science of explanations .
We know that these brain areas go along with certain kinds of conscious experience , but we don &apos;t know why they do .
I like to put this by saying that this kind of work from neuroscience is answering some of the questions we want answered about consciousness , the questions about what certain brain areas do and what they correlate with .
But in a certain sense , those are the easy problems .
No knock on the neuroscientists .
There are no truly easy problems with consciousness .
But it doesn &apos;t address the real mystery at the core of this subject : why is it that all that physical processing in a brain should be accompanied by consciousness at all ?
Why is there this inner subjective movie ?
Right now , we don &apos;t really have a bead on that .
And you might say , let &apos;s just give neuroscience a few years .
It &apos;ll turn out to be another emergent phenomenon like traffic jams , like hurricanes , like life , and we &apos;ll figure it out .
The classical cases of emergence are all cases of emergent behavior , how a traffic jam behaves , how a hurricane functions , how a living organism reproduces and adapts and metabolizes , all questions about objective functioning .
You could apply that to the human brain in explaining some of the behaviors and the functions of the human brain as emergent phenomena : how we walk , how we talk , how we play chess , all these questions about behavior .
But when it comes to consciousness , questions about behavior are among the easy problems .
And here , the standard paradigm of emergence , even the standard paradigms of neuroscience , don &apos;t really , so far , have that much to say .
Now , I &apos;m a scientific materialist at heart .
It &apos;s a long story , but the core idea is just that what you get from purely reductionist explanations in physical terms , in brain-based terms , is stories about the functioning of a system , its structure , its dynamics , the behavior it produces , great for solving the easy problems — how we behave , how we function — but when it comes to subjective experience — why does all this feel like something from the inside ? — that &apos;s something fundamentally new , and it &apos;s always a further question .
So I think we &apos;re at a kind of impasse here .
We &apos;ve got this wonderful , great chain of explanation , we &apos;re used to it , where physics explains chemistry , chemistry explains biology , biology explains parts of psychology .
But consciousness doesn &apos;t seem to fit into this picture .
On the one hand , it &apos;s a datum that we &apos;re conscious .
On the other hand , we don &apos;t know how to accommodate it into our scientific view of the world .
Faced with an anomaly like this , radical ideas may be needed , and I think that we may need one or two ideas that initially seem crazy before we can come to grips with consciousness scientifically .
Now , there are a few candidates for what those crazy ideas might be .
My friend Dan Dennett , who &apos;s here today , has one .
His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness .
The whole idea of the inner subjective movie involves a kind of illusion or confusion .
Well I say , more power to him .
That &apos;s the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if you want to have a purely reductionist brain-based theory of consciousness .
At the same time , for me and for many other people , that view is a bit too close to simply denying the datum of consciousness to be satisfactory .
So I go in a different direction .
In the time remaining , I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think may have some promise .
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental .
Physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental building blocks : space and time and mass .
They postulate fundamental laws governing them , like the laws of gravity or of quantum mechanics .
These fundamental properties and laws aren &apos;t explained in terms of anything more basic .
Rather , they &apos;re taken as primitive , and you build up the world from there .
Now sometimes , the list of fundamentals expands .
In the 19th century , Maxwell figured out that you can &apos;t explain electromagnetic phenomena in terms of the existing fundamentals — space , time , mass , Newton &apos;s laws — so he postulated fundamental laws of electromagnetism and postulated electric charge as a fundamental element that those laws govern .
I think that &apos;s the situation we &apos;re in with consciousness .
If you can &apos;t explain consciousness in terms of the existing fundamentals — space , time , mass , charge — then as a matter of logic , you need to expand the list .
The natural thing to do is to postulate consciousness itself as something fundamental , a fundamental building block of nature .
This doesn &apos;t mean you suddenly can &apos;t do science with it .
This opens up the way for you to do science with it .
What we then need is to study the fundamental laws governing consciousness , the laws that connect consciousness to other fundamentals : space , time , mass , physical processes .
Physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we could write them on the front of a t-shirt .
Well I think something like that is the situation we &apos;re in with consciousness .
We want to find fundamental laws so simple we could write them on the front of a t-shirt .
We don &apos;t know what those laws are yet , but that &apos;s what we &apos;re after .
The second crazy idea is that consciousness might be universal .
Every system might have some degree of consciousness .
This view is sometimes called panpsychism : pan for all , psych for mind , every system is conscious , not just humans , dogs , mice , flies , but even Rob Knight &apos;s microbes , elementary particles .
Even a photon has some degree of consciousness .
The idea is not that photons are intelligent or thinking .
It &apos;s not that a photon is wracked with angst because it &apos;s thinking , &quot; &quot; Aww , I &apos;m always buzzing around near the speed of light .
I never get to slow down and smell the roses . &quot; &quot; No , not like that .
But the thought is maybe photons might have some element of raw , subjective feeling , some primitive precursor to consciousness .
This may sound a bit kooky to you .
I mean , why would anyone think such a crazy thing ?
Some motivation comes from the first crazy idea , that consciousness is fundamental .
If it &apos;s fundamental , like space and time and mass , it &apos;s natural to suppose that it might be universal too , the way they are .
It &apos;s also worth noting that although the idea seems counterintuitive to us , it &apos;s much less counterintuitive to people from different cultures , where the human mind is seen as much more continuous with nature .
A deeper motivation comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way to find fundamental laws connecting consciousness to physical processing is to link consciousness to information .
Wherever there &apos;s information processing , there &apos;s consciousness .
Complex information processing , like in a human , complex consciousness .
Simple information processing , simple consciousness .
A really exciting thing is in recent years a neuroscientist , Giulio Tononi , has taken this kind of theory and developed it rigorously with a mathematical theory .
He has a mathematical measure of information integration which he calls phi , measuring the amount of information integrated in a system .
And he supposes that phi goes along with consciousness .
So in a human brain , incredibly large amount of information integration , high degree of phi , a whole lot of consciousness .
In a mouse , medium degree of information integration , still pretty significant , pretty serious amount of consciousness .
But as you go down to worms , microbes , particles , the amount of phi falls off .
The amount of information integration falls off , but it &apos;s still non-zero .
On Tononi &apos;s theory , there &apos;s still going to be a non-zero degree of consciousness .
In effect , he &apos;s proposing a fundamental law of consciousness : high phi , high consciousness .
Now , I don &apos;t know if this theory is right , but it &apos;s actually perhaps the leading theory right now in the science of consciousness , and it &apos;s been used to integrate a whole range of scientific data , and it does have a nice property that it is in fact simple enough you can write it on the front of a t-shirt .
Another final motivation is that panpsychism might help us to integrate consciousness into the physical world .
Physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract .
It describes the structure of reality using a bunch of equations , but it doesn &apos;t tell us about the reality that underlies it .
As Stephen Hawking puts it , what puts the fire into the equations ?
Well , on the panpsychist view , you can leave the equations of physics as they are , but you can take them to be describing the flux of consciousness .
That &apos;s what physics really is ultimately doing , describing the flux of consciousness .
On this view , it &apos;s consciousness that puts the fire into the equations .
On that view , consciousness doesn &apos;t dangle outside the physical world as some kind of extra .
It &apos;s there right at its heart .
This view , I think , the panpsychist view , has the potential to transfigure our relationship to nature , and it may have some pretty serious social and ethical consequences .
Some of these may be counterintuitive .
I used to think I shouldn &apos;t eat anything which is conscious , so therefore I should be vegetarian .
Now , if you &apos;re a panpsychist and you take that view , you &apos;re going to go very hungry .
So I think when you think about it , this tends to transfigure your views , whereas what matters for ethical purposes and moral considerations , not so much the fact of consciousness , but the degree and the complexity of consciousness .
It &apos;s also natural to ask about consciousness in other systems , like computers .
What about the artificially intelligent system in the movie &quot; &quot; Her , &quot; &quot; Samantha ?
Is she conscious ?
Well , if you take the informational , panpsychist view , she certainly has complicated information processing and integration , so the answer is very likely yes , she is conscious .
If that &apos;s right , it raises pretty serious ethical issues about both the ethics of developing intelligent computer systems and the ethics of turning them off .
Finally , you might ask about the consciousness of whole groups , the planet .
Does Canada have its own consciousness ?
Or at a more local level , does an integrated group like the audience at a TED conference , are we right now having a collective TED consciousness , an inner movie for this collective TED group which is distinct from the inner movies of each of our parts ?
I don &apos;t know the answer to that question , but I think it &apos;s at least one worth taking seriously .
Okay , so this panpsychist vision , it is a radical one , and I don &apos;t know that it &apos;s correct .
I &apos;m actually more confident about the first crazy idea , that consciousness is fundamental , than about the second one , that it &apos;s universal .
I mean , the view raises any number of questions , has any number of challenges , like how do those little bits of consciousness add up to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love .
If we can answer those questions , then I think we &apos;re going to be well on our way to a serious theory of consciousness .
If not , well , this is the hardest problem perhaps in science and philosophy .
We can &apos;t expect to solve it overnight .
But I do think we &apos;re going to figure it out eventually .
Understanding consciousness is a real key , I think , both to understanding the universe and to understanding ourselves .
It may just take the right crazy idea .
Thank you .

I &apos;m an ecologist , mostly a coral reef ecologist .
I started out in Chesapeake Bay and went diving in the winter and became a tropical ecologist overnight .
And it was really a lot of fun for about 10 years .
I mean , somebody pays you to go around and travel and look at some of the most beautiful places on the planet .
And that was what I did .
And I ended up in Jamaica , in the West Indies , where the coral reefs were really among the most extraordinary , structurally , that I ever saw in my life .
And this picture here , it &apos;s really interesting , it shows two things : First of all , it &apos;s in black and white because the water was so clear and you could see so far , and film was so slow in the 1960s and early 70s , you took pictures in black and white .
The other thing it shows you is that , although there &apos;s this beautiful forest of coral , there are no fish in that picture .
Those reefs at Discovery Bay , Jamaica were the most studied coral reefs in the world for 20 years .
We were the best and the brightest .
People came to study our reefs from Australia , which is sort of funny because now we go to theirs .
And the view of scientists about how coral reefs work , how they ought to be , was based on these reefs without any fish .
Then , in 1980 , there was a hurricane , Hurricane Allen .
I put half the lab up in my house .
The wind blew very strong .
The waves were 25 to 50 feet high .
And the reefs disappeared , and new islands formed , and we thought , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;re real smart .
We know that hurricanes have always happened in the past . &quot; &quot; And we published a paper in Science , the first time that anybody ever described the destruction on a coral reef by a major hurricane .
And we predicted what would happen , and we got it all wrong .
And the reason was because of overfishing , and the fact that a last common grazer , a sea urchin , died .
And within a few months after that sea urchin dying , the seaweed started to grow .
And that is the same reef ; that &apos;s the same reef 15 years ago ; that &apos;s the same reef today .
The coral reefs of the north coast of Jamaica have a few percent live coral cover and a lot of seaweed and slime .
And that &apos;s more or less the story of the coral reefs of the Caribbean , and increasingly , tragically , the coral reefs worldwide .
Now , that &apos;s my little , depressing story .
All of us in our 60s and 70s have comparable depressing stories .
There are tens of thousands of those stories out there , and it &apos;s really hard to conjure up much of a sense of well-being , because it just keeps getting worse .
And the reason it keeps getting worse is that after a natural catastrophe , like a hurricane , it used to be that there was some kind of successional sequence of recovery , but what &apos;s going on now is that overfishing and pollution and climate change are all interacting in a way that prevents that .
And so I &apos;m going to sort of go through and talk about those three kinds of things .
We hear a lot about the collapse of cod .
It &apos;s difficult to imagine that two , or some historians would say three world wars were fought during the colonial era for the control of cod .
Cod fed most of the people of Western Europe .
It fed the slaves brought to the Antilles , the song &quot; &quot; Jamaica Farewell &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; Ackee rice salt fish are nice &quot; &quot; — is an emblem of the importance of salt cod from northeastern Canada .
It all collapsed in the 80s and the 90s : 35,000 people lost their jobs .
And that was the beginning of a kind of serial depletion from bigger and tastier species to smaller and not-so-tasty species , from species that were near to home to species that were all around the world , and what have you .
It &apos;s a little hard to understand that , because you can go to a Costco in the United States and buy cheap fish .
You ought to read the label to find out where it came from , but it &apos;s still cheap , and everybody thinks it &apos;s okay .
It &apos;s hard to communicate this , and one way that I think is really interesting is to talk about sport fish , because people like to go out and catch fish .
It &apos;s one of those things .
This picture here shows the trophy fish , the biggest fish caught by people who pay a lot of money to get on a boat , go to a place off of Key West in Florida , drink a lot of beer , throw a lot of hooks and lines into the water , come back with the biggest and the best fish , and the champion trophy fish are put on this board , where people take a picture , and this guy is obviously really excited about that fish .
Well , that &apos;s what it &apos;s like now , but this is what it was like in the 1950s from the same boat in the same place on the same board on the same dock .
The trophy fish were so big that you couldn &apos;t put any of those small fish up on it .
And the average size trophy fish weighed 250 to 300 pounds , goliath grouper , and if you wanted to go out and kill something , you could pretty much count on being able to catch one of those fish .
And they tasted really good .
And people paid less in 1950 dollars to catch that than what people pay now to catch those little , tiny fish .
And that &apos;s everywhere .
It &apos;s not just the fish , though , that are disappearing .
Industrial fishing uses big stuff , big machinery .
We use nets that are 20 miles long .
We use longlines that have one million or two million hooks .
And we trawl , which means to take something the size of a tractor trailer truck that weighs thousands and thousands of pounds , put it on a big chain , and drag it across the sea floor to stir up the bottom and catch the fish .
Think of it as being kind of the bulldozing of a city or of a forest , because it clears it away .
And the habitat destruction is unbelievable .
This is a photograph , a typical photograph , of what the continental shelves of the world look like .
You can see the rows in the bottom , the way you can see the rows in a field that has just been plowed to plant corn .
What that was , was a forest of sponges and coral , which is a critical habitat for the development of fish .
What it is now is mud , and the area of the ocean floor that has been transformed from forest to level mud , to parking lot , is equivalent to the entire area of all the forests that have ever been cut down on all of the earth in the history of humanity .
We &apos;ve managed to do that in the last 100 to 150 years .
We tend to think of oil spills and mercury and we hear a lot about plastic these days .
And all of that stuff is really disgusting , but what &apos;s really insidious is the biological pollution that happens because of the magnitude of the shifts that it causes to entire ecosystems .
And I &apos;m going to just talk very briefly about two kinds of biological pollution : one is introduced species and the other is what comes from nutrients .
So this is the infamous Caulerpa taxifolia , the so-called killer algae .
A book was written about it .
It &apos;s a bit of an embarrassment .
It was accidentally released from the aquarium in Monaco , it was bred to be cold tolerant to have in peoples aquaria .
It &apos;s very pretty , and it has rapidly started to overgrow the once very rich biodiversity of the northwestern Mediterranean .
I don &apos;t know how many of you remember the movie &quot; The Little Shop of Horrors , &quot; but this is the plant of &quot; &quot; The Little Shop of Horrors . &quot; &quot; But , instead of devouring the people in the shop , what it &apos;s doing is overgrowing and smothering virtually all of the bottom-dwelling life of the entire northwestern Mediterranean Sea .
We don &apos;t know anything that eats it , we &apos;re trying to do all sorts of genetics and figure out something that could be done , but , as it stands , it &apos;s the monster from hell , about which nobody knows what to do .
Now another form of pollution that &apos;s biological pollution is what happens from excess nutrients .
The green revolution , all of this artificial nitrogen fertilizer , we use too much of it .
It &apos;s subsidized , which is one of the reasons we used too much of it .
It runs down the rivers , and it feeds the plankton , the little microscopic plant cells in the coastal water .
But since we ate all the oysters and we ate all the fish that would eat the plankton , there &apos;s nothing to eat the plankton and there &apos;s more and more of it , so it dies of old age , which is unheard of for plankton .
And when it dies , it falls to the bottom and then it rots , which means that bacteria break it down .
And in the process they use up all the oxygen , and in using up all the oxygen they make the environment utterly lethal for anything that can &apos;t swim away .
So , what we end up with is a microbial zoo dominated by bacteria and jellyfish , as you see on the left in front of you .
And the only fishery left — and it is a commercial fishery — is the jellyfish fishery you see on the right , where there used to be prawns .
Even in Newfoundland where we used to catch cod , we now have a jellyfish fishery .
And another version of this sort of thing is what is often called red tides or toxic blooms .
That picture on the left is just staggering to me .
I have talked about it a million times , but it &apos;s unbelievable .
In the upper right of that picture on the left is almost the Mississippi Delta , and the lower left of that picture is the Texas-Mexico border .
You &apos;re looking at the entire northwestern Gulf of Mexico ; you &apos;re looking at one toxic dinoflagellate bloom that can kill fish , made by that beautiful little creature on the lower right .
And in the upper right you see this black sort of cloud moving ashore .
That &apos;s the same species .
And as it comes to shore and the wind blows , and little droplets of the water get into the air , the emergency rooms of all the hospitals fill up with people with acute respiratory distress .
And that &apos;s retirement homes on the west coast of Florida .
A friend and I did this thing in Hollywood we called Hollywood ocean night , and I was trying to figure out how to explain to actors what &apos;s going on .
And I said , &quot; &quot; So , imagine you &apos;re in a movie called &apos; Escape from Malibu &apos; because all the beautiful people have moved to North Dakota , where it &apos;s clean and safe .
And the only people who are left there are the people who can &apos;t afford to move away from the coast , because the coast , instead of being paradise , is harmful to your health . &quot; &quot; And then this is amazing .
It was when I was on holiday last early autumn in France .
This is from the coast of Brittany , which is being enveloped in this green , algal slime .
The reason that it attracted so much attention , besides the fact that it &apos;s disgusting , is that sea birds flying over it are asphyxiated by the smell and die , and a farmer died of it , and you can imagine the scandal that happened .
And so there &apos;s this war between the farmers and the fishermen about it all , and the net result is that the beaches of Brittany have to be bulldozed of this stuff on a regular basis .
And then , of course , there &apos;s climate change , and we all know about climate change .
I guess the iconic figure of it is the melting of the ice in the Arctic Sea .
Think about the thousands and thousands of people who died trying to find the Northwest Passage .
Well , the Northwest Passage is already there .
I think it &apos;s sort of funny ; it &apos;s on the Siberian coast , maybe the Russians will charge tolls .
The governments of the world are taking this really seriously .
The military of the Arctic nations is taking it really seriously .
For all the denial of climate change by government leaders , the CIA and the navies of Norway and the U.S. and Canada , whatever are busily thinking about how they will secure their territory in this inevitability from their point of view .
And , of course , Arctic communities are toast .
The other kinds of effects of climate change — this is coral bleaching . It &apos;s a beautiful picture , right ?
All that white coral .
Except it &apos;s supposed to be brown .
What happens is that the corals are a symbiosis , and they have these little algal cells that live inside them .
And the algae give the corals sugar , and the corals give the algae nutrients and protection .
But when it gets too hot , the algae can &apos;t make the sugar .
The corals say , &quot; &quot; You cheated . You didn &apos;t pay your rent . &quot; &quot; They kick them out , and then they die .
Not all of them die ; some of them survive , some more are surviving , but it &apos;s really bad news .
To try and give you a sense of this , imagine you go camping in July somewhere in Europe or in North America , and you wake up the next morning , and you look around you , and you see that 80 percent of the trees , as far as you can see , have dropped their leaves and are standing there naked .
And you come home , and you discover that 80 percent of all the trees in North America and in Europe have dropped their leaves .
And then you read in the paper a few weeks later , &quot; Oh , by the way , a quarter of those died . &quot;
Well , that &apos;s what happened in the Indian Ocean during the 1998 El Nino , an area vastly greater than the size of North America and Europe , when 80 percent of all the corals bleached and a quarter of them died .
And then the really scary thing about all of this — the overfishing , the pollution and the climate change — is that each thing doesn &apos;t happen in a vacuum .
But there are these , what we call , positive feedbacks , the synergies among them that make the whole vastly greater than the sum of the parts .
And the great scientific challenge for people like me in thinking about all this , is do we know how to put Humpty Dumpty back together again ?
I mean , because we , at this point , we can protect it .
But what does that mean ?
We really don &apos;t know .
So what are the oceans going to be like in 20 or 50 years ?
Well , there won &apos;t be any fish except for minnows , and the water will be pretty dirty , and all those kinds of things and full of mercury , etc . , etc .
And dead zones will get bigger and bigger and they &apos;ll start to merge , and we can imagine something like the dead-zonification of the global , coastal ocean .
Then you sure won &apos;t want to eat fish that were raised in it , because it would be a kind of gastronomic Russian roulette .
Sometimes you have a toxic bloom ; sometimes you don &apos;t .
That doesn &apos;t sell .
The really scary things though are the physical , chemical , oceanographic things that are happening .
As the surface of the ocean gets warmer , the water is lighter when it &apos;s warmer , it becomes harder and harder to turn the ocean over .
We say it becomes more strongly stratified .
The consequence of that is that all those nutrients that fuel the great anchoveta fisheries , of the sardines of California or in Peru or whatever , those slow down and those fisheries collapse .
And , at the same time , water from the surface , which is rich in oxygen , doesn &apos;t make it down and the ocean turns into a desert .
So the question is : How are we all going to respond to this ?
And we can do all sorts of things to fix it , but in the final analysis , the thing we really need to fix is ourselves .
It &apos;s not about the fish ; it &apos;s not about the pollution ; it &apos;s not about the climate change .
It &apos;s about us and our greed and our need for growth and our inability to imagine a world that is different from the selfish world we live in today .
So the question is : Will we respond to this or not ?
I would say that the future of life and the dignity of human beings depends on our doing that .
Thank you . ( Applause )
Chris Anderson : Elon , what kind of crazy dream would persuade you to think of trying to take on the auto industry and build an all-electric car ?
Elon Musk : Well , it goes back to when I was in university .
I thought about , what are the problems that are most likely to affect the future of the world or the future of humanity ?
I think it &apos;s extremely important that we have sustainable transport and sustainable energy production .
That sort of overall sustainable energy problem is the biggest problem that we have to solve this century , independent of environmental concerns .
CA : Most of American electricity comes from burning fossil fuels .
How can an electric car that plugs into that electricity help ?
EM : Right . There &apos;s two elements to that answer .
One is that , even if you take the same source fuel and produce power at the power plant and use it to charge electric cars , you &apos;re still better off .
If you put that same fuel in an internal combustion engine car , you get about 20 percent efficiency .
And the reason is , in the stationary power plant , you can afford to have something that weighs a lot more , is voluminous , and you can take the waste heat and run a steam turbine and generate a secondary power source .
So in effect , even after you &apos;ve taken transmission loss into account and everything , even using the same source fuel , you &apos;re at least twice as better off charging an electric car , then burning it at the power plant .
CA : That scale delivers efficiency .
EM : Yes , it does .
And then the other point is , we have to have sustainable means of power generation anyway , electricity generation .
So given that we have to solve sustainable electricity generation , then it makes sense for us to have electric cars as the mode of transport .
CA : So we &apos;ve got some video here of the Tesla being assembled , which , if we could play that first video — So what is innovative about this process in this vehicle ?
EM : Sure . So , in order to accelerate the advent of electric transport , and I should say that I think , actually , all modes of transport will become fully electric with the ironic exception of rockets .
There &apos;s just no way around Newton &apos;s third law .
The question is how do you accelerate the advent of electric transport ?
In fact , we applied a lot of rocket design techniques to make the car light despite having a very large battery pack .
And then it also has the lowest drag coefficient of any car of its size .
So as a result , the energy usage is very low , and it has the most advanced battery pack , and that &apos;s what gives it the range that &apos;s competitive , so you can actually have on the order of a 250-mile range .
CA : I mean , those battery packs are incredibly heavy , but you think the math can still work out intelligently — by combining light body , heavy battery , you can still gain spectacular efficiency .
EM : Exactly . The rest of the car has to be very light to offset the mass of the pack , and then you have to have a low drag coefficient so that you have good highway range .
And in fact , customers of the Model S are sort of competing with each other to try to get the highest possible range .
I think somebody recently got 420 miles out of a single charge .
CA : Bruno Bowden , who &apos;s here , did that , broke the world record.EM : Congratulations .
CA : That was the good news . The bad news was that to do it , he had to drive at 18 miles an hour constant speed and got pulled over by the cops . ( Laughter ) EM : I mean , you can certainly drive — if you drive it 65 miles an hour , under normal conditions , 250 miles is a reasonable number .
Not at all a dig at The New York Times , this , by the way .
What is the most surprising thing about the experience of driving the car ?
EM : In creating an electric car , the responsiveness of the car is really incredible .
You can do that with an electric car because of its responsiveness .
You can &apos;t do that with a gasoline car .
I think that &apos;s really a profound difference , and people only experience that when they have a test drive .
CA : I mean , this is a beautiful but expensive car .
Is there a road map where this becomes a mass-market vehicle ?
So we &apos;re at step two at this point .
So we had a $ 100,000 sports car , which was the Roadster .
But whenever you &apos;ve got really new technology , it generally takes about three major versions in order to make it a compelling mass-market product .
And so I think we &apos;re making progress in that direction , and I feel confident that we &apos;ll get there .
CA : I mean , right now , if you &apos;ve got a short commute , you can drive , you can get back , you can charge it at home .
There isn &apos;t a huge nationwide network of charging stations now that are fast .
Do you see that coming , really , truly , or just on a few key routes ?
EM : There actually are far more charging stations than people realize , and at Tesla we developed something called a Supercharging technology , and we &apos;re offering that if you buy a Model S for free , forever .
And so this is something that maybe a lot of people don &apos;t realize .
We actually have California and Nevada covered , and we &apos;ve got the Eastern seaboard from Boston to D.C. covered .
And the key thing is to have a ratio of drive to stop , to stop time , of about six or seven .
CA : So your proposition to consumers is , for the full charge , it could take an hour .
So it &apos;s common — don &apos;t expect to be out of here in 10 minutes .
EM : Actually , what we &apos;re expecting is for people to stop for about 20 to 30 minutes , not for an hour .
It &apos;s actually better to drive for about maybe 160 , 170 miles and then stop for half an hour and then keep going .
That &apos;s the natural cadence of a trip .
CA : All right . So this is only one string to your energy bow .
You &apos;ve been working on this solar company SolarCity .
What &apos;s unusual about that ?
EM : Well , as I mentioned earlier , we have to have sustainable electricity production as well as consumption , so I &apos;m quite confident that the primary means of power generation will be solar .
I mean , it &apos;s really indirect fusion , is what it is .
We &apos;ve got this giant fusion generator in the sky called the sun , and we just need to tap a little bit of that energy for purposes of human civilization .
What most people know but don &apos;t realize they know is that the world is almost entirely solar-powered already .
If the sun wasn &apos;t there , we &apos;d be a frozen ice ball at three degrees Kelvin , and the sun powers the entire system of precipitation .
The whole ecosystem is solar-powered .
CA : But in a gallon of gasoline , you have , effectively , thousands of years of sun power compressed into a small space , so it &apos;s hard to make the numbers work right now on solar , and to remotely compete with , for example , natural gas , fracked natural gas . How are you going to build a business here ?
EM : Well actually , I &apos;m confident that solar will beat everything , hands down , including natural gas .
( Applause ) CA : How ?
EM : It must , actually . If it doesn &apos;t , we &apos;re in deep trouble .
CA : But you &apos;re not selling solar panels to consumers .
What are you doing ?
EM : No , we actually are . You can buy a solar system or you can lease a solar system .
Most people choose to lease .
And the thing about solar power is that it doesn &apos;t have any feed stock or operational costs , so once it &apos;s installed , it &apos;s just there .
It works for decades . It &apos;ll work for probably a century .
So therefore , the key thing to do is to get the cost of that initial installation low , and then get the cost of the financing low , because that interest — those are the two factors that drive the cost of solar .
And we &apos;ve made huge progress in that direction , and that &apos;s why I &apos;m confident we &apos;ll actually beat natural gas .
CA : So your current proposition to consumers is , don &apos;t pay so much up front .
EM : Zero.CA : Pay zero up front .
We will install panels on your roof .
You will then pay , how long is a typical lease ?
EM : Typical leases are 20 years , but the value proposition is , as you &apos;re sort of alluding to , quite straightforward .
It &apos;s no money down , and your utility bill decreases .
Pretty good deal .
CA : So that seems like a win for the consumer .
No risk , you &apos;ll pay less than you &apos;re paying now .
For you , the dream here then is that — I mean , who owns the electricity from those panels for the longer term ?
I mean , how do you , the company , benefit ?
EM : Well , essentially , SolarCity raises a chunk of capital from say , a company or a bank .
Google is one of our big partners here .
And they have an expected return on that capital .
With that capital , SolarCity purchases and installs the panel on the roof and then charges the homeowner or business owner a monthly lease payment , which is less than the utility bill .
CA : But you yourself get a long-term commercial benefit from that power .
You &apos;re kind of building a new type of distributed utility .
EM : Exactly . What it amounts to is a giant distributed utility .
I think it &apos;s a good thing , because utilities have been this monopoly , and people haven &apos;t had any choice .
So effectively it &apos;s the first time there &apos;s been competition for this monopoly , because the utilities have been the only ones that owned those power distribution lines , but now it &apos;s on your roof .
So I think it &apos;s actually very empowering for homeowners and businesses .
EM : I &apos;m extremely confident that solar will be at least a plurality of power , and most likely a majority , and I predict it will be a plurality in less than 20 years .
I made that bet with someone — CA : Definition of plurality is ?
EM : More from solar than any other source .
CA : Ah . Who did you make the bet with ?
EM : With a friend who will remain nameless .
CA : Just between us . ( Laughter ) EM : I made that bet , I think , two or three years ago , so in roughly 18 years , I think we &apos;ll see more power from solar than any other source .
You &apos;d made some money from the sale of PayPal .
You decided to build a space company .
Why on Earth would someone do that ?
( Laughter ) EM : I got that question a lot , that &apos;s true .
And they &apos;d look at me , like , &quot; &quot; Is he serious ? &quot; &quot; CA : And strangely , you were . So what happened ?
EM : It was a close call . Things almost didn &apos;t work out .
CA : Would humanity become a space-faring civilization ?
So that was a dream of yours , in a way , from a young age ?
You &apos;ve dreamed of Mars and beyond ?
EM : I did build rockets when I was a kid , but I didn &apos;t think I &apos;d be involved in this .
It was really more from the standpoint of what are the things that need to happen in order for the future to be an exciting and inspiring one ?
How on Earth have you done that ?
NASA has been doing this for years . How have you done this ?
There &apos;s a long list of innovations that we &apos;ve come up with there that are a little difficult to communicate in this talk , but — CA : Not least because you could still get copied , right ?
EM : No , we don &apos;t patent.CA : You didn &apos;t patent because you think it &apos;s more dangerous to patent than not to patent .
EM : Since our primary competitors are national governments , the enforceability of patents is questionable . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : That &apos;s really , really interesting .
But the big innovation is still ahead , and you &apos;re working on it now . Tell us about this .
All rockets that fly today are fully expendable .
So the space shuttle ended up costing a billion dollars per flight .
Obviously that doesn &apos;t work very well for — CA : What just happened there ? We just saw something land ?
EM : That &apos;s right . So it &apos;s important that the rocket stages be able to come back , to be able to return to the launch site and be ready to launch again within a matter of hours .
CA : Wow . Reusable rockets.EM : Yes . ( Applause ) And so what a lot of people don &apos;t realize is , the cost of the fuel , of the propellant , is very small .
It &apos;s much like on a jet .
So the cost of the propellant is about .3 percent of the cost of the rocket .
So it &apos;s possible to achieve , let &apos;s say , roughly 100-fold improvement in the cost of spaceflight if you can effectively reuse the rocket .
That &apos;s why it &apos;s so important .
Every mode of transport that we use , whether it &apos;s planes , trains , automobiles , bikes , horses , is reusable , but not rockets .
So we must solve this problem in order to become a space-faring civilization .
CA : You asked me the question earlier of how popular traveling on cruises would be if you had to burn your ships afterward.EM : Certain cruises are apparently highly problematic .
CA : Definitely more expensive .
So that &apos;s potentially absolutely disruptive technology , and , I guess , paves the way for your dream to actually take , at some point , to take humanity to Mars at scale .
You &apos;d like to see a colony on Mars .
CA : So progress on this &quot; &quot; let &apos;s make it reusable , &quot; &quot; how is that going ? That was just a simulation video we saw .
How &apos;s it going ?
EM : We &apos;re actually , we &apos;ve been making some good progress recently with something we call the Grasshopper Test Project , where we &apos;re testing the vertical landing portion of the flight , the sort of terminal portion which is quite tricky .
And we &apos;ve had some good tests .
CA : Can we see that ? EM : Yeah .
So that &apos;s just to give a sense of scale .
We dressed a cowboy as Johnny Cash and bolted the mannequin to the rocket . ( Laughter ) CA : All right , let &apos;s see that video then , because this is actually amazing when you think about it .
You &apos;ve never seen this before . A rocket blasting off and then — EM : Yeah , so that rocket is about the size of a 12-story building .
( Rocket launch ) So now it &apos;s hovering at about 40 meters , and it &apos;s constantly adjusting the angle , the pitch and yaw of the main engine , and maintaining roll with cold gas thrusters .
CA : How cool is that ? ( Applause ) Elon , how have you done this ?
These projects are so — Paypal , SolarCity , Tesla , SpaceX , they &apos;re so spectacularly different , they &apos;re such ambitious projects at scale .
How on Earth has one person been able to innovate in this way ?
What is it about you ?
EM : I don &apos;t know , actually .
I don &apos;t have a good answer for you .
I work a lot . I mean , a lot .
CA : Well , I have a theory.EM : Okay . All right .
You bet your fortune on it , and you seem to have done that multiple times .
I mean , almost no one can do that .
Is that — could we have some of that secret sauce ?
Can we put it into our education system ? Can someone learn from you ?
It is truly amazing what you &apos;ve done .
Well , I do think there &apos;s a good framework for thinking .
It is physics . You know , the sort of first principles reasoning .
And you have to do that .
Otherwise , mentally , you wouldn &apos;t be able to get through the day .
But when you want to do something new , you have to apply the physics approach .
It &apos;s really counterintuitive .
So I think that &apos;s an important thing to do , and then also to really pay attention to negative feedback , and solicit it , particularly from friends .
This may sound like simple advice , but hardly anyone does that , and it &apos;s incredibly helpful .
CA : Boys and girls watching , study physics .
Learn from this man .
Elon Musk , I wish we had all day , but thank you so much for coming to TED .
EM : Thank you . CA : That was awesome . That was really , really cool .
Thank you so much .
I &apos;m going to start by asking you a question : Is anyone familiar with the blue algae problem ?
Okay , so most of you are .
I think we can all agree it &apos;s a serious issue .
Nobody wants to drink blue algae-contaminated water , or swim in a blue algae-infested lake .
Right ?
I hope you won &apos;t be disappointed , but today , I won &apos;t be talking about blue algae .
Instead , I &apos;ll be talking about the main cause at the root of this issue , which I will be referring to as the phosphorus crisis .
Why have I chosen to talk to you about the phosphorus crisis today ?
For the simple reason that nobody else is talking about it .
And by the end of my presentation , I hope that the general public will be more aware of this crisis and this issue .
Now , the problem is that if I ask , why do we find ourselves in this situation with blue algae ?
The answer is that it comes from how we farm .
We use fertilizers in our farming , chemical fertilizers .
Why do we use chemical fertilizers in agriculture ?
Basically , to help plants grow and to produce a better yield .
The issue is that this is set to engender an environmental problem that is without precedent .
Before going further , let me give you a crash course in plant biology .
So , what does a plant need in order to grow ?
A plant , quite simply , needs light , it needs CO2 , but even more importantly , it needs nutrients , which it draws from the soil .
Several of these nutrients are essential chemical elements : phosphorus , nitrogen and calcium .
So , the plant ’ s roots will extract these resources .
Today I &apos;ll be focusing on a major problem that is linked to phosphorus .
Why phosphorus in particular ?
Because it is the most problematic chemical element .
By the end of my presentation , you will have seen what these problems are , and where we are today .
Phosphorus is a chemical element that is essential to life . This is a very important point .
I ’ d like everyone to understand precisely what the phosphorus issue is .
Phosphorus is a key component in several molecules , in many of our molecules of life .
Experts in the field will know that cellular communication is phosphorus-based — phosphorylation , dephosphorylation .
Cell membranes are phosphorus-based : These are called phospholipids .
The energy in all living things , ATP , is phosphorus-based .
And more importantly still , phosphorus is a key component of DNA , something everyone is familiar with , and which is shown in this image .
DNA is our genetic heritage .
It is extremely important , and once again , phosphorus is a key player .
Now , where do we find this phosphorus ?
As humans , where do we find it ?
As I explained earlier , plants extract phosphorus from the soil , through water .
So , we humans get it from the things we eat : plants , vegetables , fruits , and also from eggs , meat and milk .
It ’ s true that some humans eat better than others .
Some are happier than others .
And now , looking at this picture , which speaks for itself , we see modern agriculture , which I also refer to as intensive agriculture .
Intensive agriculture is based on the use of chemical fertilizers .
Without them , we would not manage to produce enough to feed the world &apos;s population .
Speaking of humans , there are currently 7 billion of us on Earth .
In less than 40 years , there will be 9 billion of us .
And the question is a simple one : Do we have enough phosphorus to feed our future generations ?
So , in order to understand these issues , where do we find our phosphorus ?
Let me explain .
But first , let ’ s just suppose that we are using 100 percent of a given dose of phosphorus .
Only 15 percent of this 100 percent goes to the plant . Eighty-five percent is lost .
It goes into the soil , ending its journey in the lakes , resulting in lakes with extra phosphorus , which leads to the blue algae problem .
So , you ’ ll see there ’ s a problem here , something that is illogical .
A hundred percent of the phosphorus is used , but only 15 percent goes to the plant .
You ’ re going to tell me it ’ s wasteful .
Yes , it is . What is worse is that it is very expensive .
Nobody wants to throw their money out the window , but unfortunately that &apos;s what is happening here .
Eighty percent of each dose of phosphorus is lost .
Modern agriculture depends on phosphorus .
And because in order to get 15 percent of it to the plant , all the rest is lost , we have to add more and more .
Now , where will we get this phosphorus from ?
Basically , we get it out of mines .
This is the cover of an extraordinary article published in Nature in 2009 , which really launched the discussion about the phosphorus crisis .
Phosphorus , a nutrient essential to life , which is becoming increasingly scarce , yet nobody is talking about it .
And everyone agrees : Politicians and scientists are in agreement that we are headed for a phosphorus crisis .
What you are seeing here is an open-pit mine in the U.S. , and to give you an idea of the dimensions of this mine , if you look in the top right-hand corner , the little crane you can see , that is a giant crane .
So that really puts it into perspective .
So , we get phosphorus from mines .
And if I make a comparison with oil , there ’ s an oil crisis , we talk about it , we talk about global warming , yet we never mention the phosphorus crisis .
To come back to the oil problem , oil is something we can replace .
We can use biofuels , or solar power , or hydropower , but phosphorus is an essential element , indispensable to life , and we can ’ t replace it .
What is the current state of the world &apos;s phosphorus reserves ?
This graph gives you a rough idea of where we are today .
The black line represents predictions for phosphorus reserves .
In 2030 , we ’ ll reach the peak .
By the end of this century , it will all be gone .
The dotted line shows where we are today .
As you can see , they meet in 2030 , I ’ ll be retired by then .
But we are indeed heading for a major crisis , and I ’ d like people to become aware of this problem .
Do we have a solution ?
What are we to do ? We are faced with a paradox .
Less and less phosphorus will be available .
By 2050 there will be 9 billion of us , and according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization , we will need to produce twice as much food in 2050 than we do today .
So , we will have less phosphorus , but we &apos;ll need to produce more food .
What should we do ?
It truly is a paradoxical situation .
Do we have a solution , or an alternative which will allow us to optimize phosphorus use ?
Remember that 80 percent is destined to be lost .
The solution I &apos;m offering today is one that has existed for a very long time , even before plants existed on Earth , and it &apos;s a microscopic mushroom that is very mysterious , very simple , and yet also extremely complex .
I &apos;ve been fascinated by this little mushroom for over 16 years now .
It has led me to further my research and to use it as a model for my laboratory research .
This mushroom exists in symbiosis with the roots .
By symbiosis , I mean a bidirectional and mutually beneficial association which is also called mycorrhiza .
This slide illustrates the elements of a mycorrhiza .
You ’ re looking at the root of wheat , one of the world ’ s most important plants .
Normally , a root will find phosphorus all by itself .
It will go in search of phosphorus , but only within the one millimeter which surrounds it .
Beyond one millimeter , the root is ineffective .
It cannot go further in its search for phosphorus .
Now , imagine this tiny , microscopic mushroom .
It grows much faster , and is much better designed to seek out phosphorus .
It can go beyond the root ’ s one-millimeter scope to seek out phosphorus .
I haven ’ t invented anything at all ; it &apos;s a biotechnology that has existed for 450 million years .
And over time , this mushroom has evolved and adapted to seek out even the tiniest trace of phosphorus , and to put it to use , to make it available to the plant .
What you ’ re seeing here , in the real world , is a carrot root , and the mushroom with its very fine filaments .
Looking closer , we can see that this mushroom is very gentle in its penetration .
It will proliferate between the root &apos;s cells , eventually penetrating a cell and starting to form a typical arbuscular structure , which will considerably increase the exchange interface between the plant and the mushroom .
And it is through this structure that mutual exchanges will occur .
It ’ s a win-win trade : I give you phosphorus , and you feed me .
True symbiosis .
Now let &apos;s add a mycorrhiza plant into the diagram I used earlier .
And instead of using a 100 percent dose , I ’ m going to reduce it to 25 percent .
You ’ ll see that of this 25 percent , most will benefit the plant , more than 90 percent .
A very small amount of phosphorus will remain in the soil .
That &apos;s completely natural .
What &apos;s more is that in certain cases , we don &apos;t even need to add phosphorus .
If you recall the graphs I showed you earlier , 85 percent of phosphorus is lost in the soil , and the plants are unable to access it .
Even though it is present in the soil , it is in insoluble form .
The plant is only able to seek out soluble forms .
The mushroom is capable of dissolving this insoluble form and making it available for the plant to use .
To further support my argument , here is a picture that speaks for itself .
These are trials in a field of sorghum .
On the left side , you see the yield produced using conventional agriculture , with a 100 percent phosphorus dose .
On the other side , the dose was reduced to 50 percent , and just look at the yield .
With only a half-dose , we achieved a better yield .
This is to show you that this method works .
And in some cases , in Cuba , Mexico and India , the dose can be reduced to 25 percent , and in several other cases , there &apos;s no need to add any phosphorus at all , because the mushrooms are so well adapted to finding phosphorus and drawing it from the soil .
This is an example of soy production in Canada .
Mycorrhiza was used in one field but not in the other .
And here , where blue indicates a better yield , and yellow a weaker yield .
The black rectangle is the plot from which the mycorrhiza was added .
In other words , as I already said , I have invented nothing .
Mycorrhiza has existed for 450 million years , and it has even helped modern-day plant species to diversify .
So , this it isn &apos;t something that is still undergoing lab tests .
Mycorrhiza exists , it works , it &apos;s produced at an industrial scale and commercialized worldwide .
The problem is that people are not aware of it .
People like food producers and farmers are still not aware of this problem .
We have a technology that works , and one that , if used correctly , will alleviate some of the pressure we are putting on the world &apos;s phosphorus reserves .
In conclusion , I am a scientist and a dreamer .
I &apos;m passionate about this topic .
So if you were to ask me what my retirement dream is , which will be at the moment we reach that phosphorus peak , it would be that we use one label , &quot; &quot; Made with mycorrhiza , &quot; &quot; and that my children and grandchildren buy products bearing that label too .
Thank you for your attention .

On March 14 , this year , I posted this poster on Facebook .
This is an image of me and my daughter holding the Israeli flag .
I will try to explain to you about the context of why and when I posted .
A few days ago , I was sitting waiting on the line at the grocery store , and the owner and one of the clients were talking to each other , and the owner was explaining to the client that we &apos;re going to get 10,000 missiles on Israel .
And the client was saying , no , it &apos;s 10,000 a day .
( Laughter ) ( &quot; &quot; 10,000 missiles &quot; &quot; ) This is the context . This is where we are now in Israel .
We have this war with Iran coming for 10 years now , and we have people , you know , afraid .
It &apos;s like every year it &apos;s the last minute that we can do something about the war with Iran .
It &apos;s like , if we don &apos;t act now , it &apos;s too late forever , for 10 years now .
So at some point it became , you know , to me , I &apos;m a graphic designer , so I made posters about it and I posted the one I just showed you before .
Most of the time , I make posters , I post them on Facebook , my friends like it , don &apos;t like it , most of the time don &apos;t like it , don &apos;t share it , don &apos;t nothing , and it &apos;s another day .
So I went to sleep , and that was it for me .
And later on in the night , I woke up because I &apos;m always waking up in the night , and I went by the computer and I see all these red dots , you know , on Facebook , which I &apos;ve never seen before .
( Laughter ) And I was like , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; So I come to the computer and I start looking on , and suddenly I see many people talking to me , most of them I don &apos;t know , and a few of them from Iran , which is — What ?
Because you have to understand , in Israel we don &apos;t talk with people from Iran .
We don &apos;t know people from Iran .
It &apos;s like , on Facebook , you have friends only from — it &apos;s like your neighbors are your friends on Facebook .
And now people from Iran are talking to me .
So I start answering this girl , and she &apos;s telling me she saw the poster and she asked her family to come , because they don &apos;t have a computer , she asked her family to come to see the poster , and they &apos;re all sitting in the living room crying .
So I &apos;m like , whoa .
I ask my wife to come , and I tell her , you have to see that .
People are crying , and she came , she read the text , and she started to cry .
And everybody &apos;s crying now . ( Laughter ) So I don &apos;t know what to do , so my first reflex , as a graphic designer , is , you know , to show everybody what I &apos;d just seen , and people started to see them and to share them , and that &apos;s how it started .
The day after , when really it became a lot of talking , I said to myself , and my wife said to me , I also want a poster , so this is her . ( Laughter ) Because it &apos;s working , put me in a poster now .
But more seriously , I was like , okay , these ones work , but it &apos;s not just about me , it &apos;s about people from Israel who want to say something .
So I &apos;m going to shoot all the people I know , if they want , and I &apos;m going to put them in a poster and I &apos;m going to share them .
So I went to my neighbors and friends and students and I just asked them , give me a picture , I will make you a poster .
And that &apos;s how it started . And that &apos;s how , really , it &apos;s unleashed , because suddenly people from Facebook , friends and others , just understand that they can be part of it .
It &apos;s not just one dude making one poster , it &apos;s — we can be part of it , so they start sending me pictures and ask me , &quot; &quot; Make me a poster . Post it .
Tell the Iranians we from Israel love you too . &quot; &quot; It became , you know , at some point it was really , really intense .
I mean , so many pictures , so I asked friends to come , graphic designers most of them , to make posters with me , because I didn &apos;t have the time .
It was a huge amount of pictures .
So for a few days , that &apos;s how my living room was .
And we received Israeli posters , Israeli images , but also lots of comments , lots of messages from Iran .
And we took these messages and we made posters out of it , because I know people : They don &apos;t read , they see images .
If it &apos;s an image , they may read it .
So here are a few of them .
( &quot; &quot; You are my first Israelian friend . I wish we both get rid of our idiot politicians , anyway nice to see you ! &quot; &quot; ) ( &quot; &quot; I love that blue . I love that star . I love that flag . &quot; &quot; ) This one is really moving for me because it &apos;s the story of a girl who has been raised in Iran to walk on an Israeli flag to enter her school every morning , and now that she sees the posters that we &apos;re sending , she starts — she said that she changed her mind , and now she loves that blue , she loves that star , and she loves that flag , talking about the Israeli flag ,
and she wished that we &apos;d meet and come to visit one another , and just a few days after I posted the first poster .
The day after , Iranians started to respond with their own posters .
They have graphic designers . What ? ( Laughter ) Crazy , crazy .
So you can see they are still shy , they don &apos;t want to show their faces , but they want to spread the message .
They want to respond . They want to say the same thing .
So . And now it &apos;s communication .
It &apos;s a two-way story . It &apos;s Israelis and Iranians sending the same message , one to each other .
( &quot; &quot; My Israeli Friends . I don &apos;t hate you . I don &apos;t want War . &quot; &quot; ) This never happened before , and this is two people supposed to be enemies , we &apos;re on the verge of a war , and suddenly people on Facebook are starting to say , &quot; I like this guy . I love those guys . &quot;
And it became really big at some point .
And then it became news .
Because when you &apos;re seeing the Middle East , you see only the bad news .
And suddenly , there is something that was happening that was good news . So the guys on the news , they say , &quot; &quot; Okay , let &apos;s talk about this . &quot; &quot; And they just came , and it was so much , I remember one day , Michal , she was talking with the journalist , and she was asking him , &quot; Who &apos;s gonna see the show ? &quot; And he said , &quot; Everybody . &quot;
So she said , &quot; &quot; Everybody in Palestine , in where ? Israel ?
Who is everybody ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Everybody . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Syria ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; Lebanon ? &quot; &quot; Lebanon . &quot;
At some point , he just said , &quot; &quot; 40 million people are going to see you today .
It &apos;s everybody . &quot; &quot; The Chinese .
And we were just at the beginning of the story .
Something crazy also happened .
Every time a country started talking about it , like Germany , America , wherever , a page on Facebook popped up with the same logo with the same stories , so at the beginning we had &quot; &quot; Iran-Loves-Israel , &quot; &quot; which is an Iranian sitting in Tehran , saying , &quot; &quot; Okay , Israel loves Iran ?
I give you Iran-Loves-Israel . &quot; &quot; You have Palestine-Loves-Israel .
You have Lebanon that just — a few days ago .
And this whole list of pages on Facebook dedicated to the same message , to people sending their love , one to each other .
The moment I really understood that something was happening , a friend of mine told me , &quot; Google the word &apos; Israel . &apos; &quot; And those were the first images on those days that popped up from Google when you were typing , &quot; &quot; Israel &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Iran . &quot; &quot; We really changed how people see the Middle East .
Because you &apos;re not in the Middle East .
You &apos;re somewhere over there , and then you want to see the Middle East , so you go on Google and you say , &quot; &quot; Israel , &quot; &quot; and they give you the bad stuff .
And for a few days you got those images .
Today the Israel-Loves-Iran page is this number , 80,831 , and two million people last week went on the page and shared , liked , I don &apos;t know , commented on one of the photos .
So for five months now , that &apos;s what we are doing , me , Michal , a few of my friends , are just making images .
We &apos;re showing a new reality by just making images because that &apos;s how the world perceives us .
They see images of us , and they see bad images .
So we &apos;re working on making good images . End of story .
Look at this one . This is the Iran-Loves-Israel page .
This is not the Israel-Loves-Iran . This is not my page .
This is a guy in Tehran on the day of remembrance of the Israeli fallen soldier putting an image of an Israeli soldier on his page .
This is the enemy .
What ?
( &quot; &quot; Our heartfelt condolences to the families who lost their dearests in terror attack in Bulgaria &quot; &quot; ) And it &apos;s going both ways .
It &apos;s like , we are showing respect , one to each other .
And we &apos;re understanding . And you show compassion .
And you become friends .
And at some point , you become friends on Facebook , and you become friends in life .
You can go and travel and meet people .
And I was in Munich a few weeks ago .
I went there to open an exposition about Iran and I met there with people from the page that told me , &quot; &quot; Okay , you &apos;re going to be in Europe , I &apos;m coming . I &apos;m coming from France , from Holland , from Germany , &quot; &quot; of course , and from Israel people came , and we just met there for the first time in real life .
I met with people that are supposed to be my enemies for the first time . And we just shake hands , and have a coffee and a nice discussion , and we talk about food and basketball .
And that was the end of it .
Remember that image from the beginning ?
At some point we met in real life , and we became friends .
And it goes the other way around .
Some girl that we met on Facebook never been in Israel , born and raised in Iran , lives in Germany , afraid of Israelis because of what she knows about us , decides after a few months of talking on the Internet with some Israelis to come to Israel , and she gets on the plane and arrives at Ben Gurion and says , &quot; &quot; Okay , not that big a deal . &quot; &quot; So a few weeks ago , the stress is getting higher , so we start this new campaign called &quot; &quot; Not ready to die in your war . &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s plus / minus the same message , but we wanted really to add some aggressivity to it .
And again , something amazing happened , something that we didn &apos;t have on the first wave of the campaign .
Now people from Iran , the same ones who were shy at the first campaign and just sent , you know , their foot and half their faces , now they &apos;re sending their faces , and they &apos;re saying , &quot; Okay , no problem , we &apos;re into it . We are with you . &quot;
Just read where those guys are from .
And for every guy from Israel , you &apos;ve got someone from Iran .
Just people sending their pictures .
Crazy , yes ?
So — ( Applause ) So you may ask yourself , who is this dude ?
My name is Ronny Edry , and I &apos;m 41 , I &apos;m an Israeli , I &apos;m a father of two , I &apos;m a husband , and I &apos;m a graphic designer . I &apos;m teaching graphic design .
And I &apos;m not that naive , because a lot of the time I &apos;ve been asked , many times I &apos;ve been asked , &quot; &quot; Yeah , but , this is really naive , sending flowers over , I mean — &quot; &quot; I was in the army . I was in the paratroopers for three years , and I know how it looks from the ground .
I know how it can look really bad .
So to me , this is the courageous thing to do , to try to reach the other side before it &apos;s too late , because when it &apos;s going to be too late , it &apos;s going to be too late .
And sometimes war is inevitable , sometimes , but maybe &#91; with &#93; effort , we can avoid it .
Maybe as people , because especially in Israel , we &apos;re in a democracy . We have the freedom of speech , and maybe that little thing can change something .
And really , we can be our own ambassadors .
We can just send a message and hope for the best .
So I want to ask Michal , my wife , to come with me on the stage just to make with you one image , because it &apos;s all about images .
And maybe that image will help us change something .
Just raise that . Exactly .
And I &apos;m just going to take a picture of it , and I &apos;m just going to post it on Facebook with kind of &quot; &quot; Israelis for peace &quot; &quot; or something .
Oh my God .
Don &apos;t cry .
Thank you guys .

I &apos;m a writer and a journalist , and I &apos;m also an insanely curious person , so in 22 years as a journalist , I &apos;ve learned how to do a lot of new things .
And three years ago , one of the things I learned how to do was to become invisible .
I became one of the working homeless .
I quit my job as a newspaper editor after my father died in February of that same year , and decided to travel .
His death hit me pretty hard .
And there were a lot of things that I wanted to feel and deal with while I was doing that .
I &apos;ve camped my whole life . And I decided that living in a van for a year to do this would be like one long camping trip .
So I packed my cat , my Rottweiler and my camping gear into a 1975 Chevy van , and drove off into the sunset , having fully failed to realize three critical things .
One : that society equates living in a permanent structure , even a shack , with having value as a person .
Two : I failed to realize how quickly the negative perceptions of other people can impact our reality , if we let it .
Three : I failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude , not a lifestyle .
At first , living in the van was great .
I showered in campgrounds . I ate out regularly .
And I had time to relax and to grieve .
But then the anger and the depression about my father &apos;s death set in .
My freelance job ended . And I had to get a full-time job to pay the bills .
What had been a really mild spring turned into a miserably hot summer .
And it became impossible to park anywhere — ( Laughs ) — without being very obvious that I had a cat and a dog with me , and it was really hot .
The cat came and went through an open window in the van .
The doggy went into doggy day care .
And I sweated .
Whenever I could , I used employee showers in office buildings and truck stops .
Or I washed up in public rest rooms .
Nighttime temperatures in the van rarely dropped below 80 degrees Fahrenheit , making it difficult or impossible to sleep .
Food rotted in the heat .
Ice in my ice chest melted within hours , and it was pretty miserable .
I couldn &apos;t afford to find an apartment , or couldn &apos;t afford an apartment that would allow me to have the Rottweiler and the cat .
And I refused to give them up , so I stayed in the van .
And when the heat made me too sick to walk the 50 feet to the public restroom outside my van at night , I used a bucket and a trash bag as a toilet .
When winter weather set in , the temperatures dropped below freezing . And they stayed there .
And I faced a whole new set of challenges .
I parked a different place every night so I would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police .
I didn &apos;t always succeed .
But I felt out of control of my life .
And I don &apos;t know when or how it happened , but the speed at which I went from being a talented writer and journalist to being a homeless woman , living in a van , took my breath away .
I hadn &apos;t changed . My I.Q. hadn &apos;t dropped .
My talent , my integrity , my values , everything about me remained the same .
But I had changed somehow .
I spiraled deeper and deeper into a depression .
And eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic .
And I went . I hadn &apos;t bathed in three days .
I was as smelly and as depressed as anyone in line .
I just wasn &apos;t drunk or high .
And when several of the homeless men realized that , including a former university professor , they said , &quot; &quot; You aren &apos;t homeless . Why are you really here ? &quot; &quot; Other homeless people didn &apos;t see me as homeless , but I did .
Then the professor listened to my story and he said , &quot; &quot; You have a job . You have hope .
The real homeless don &apos;t have hope . &quot; &quot; A reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression left me suicidal . And I remember thinking , &quot; If I killed myself , no one would notice . &quot;
A friend told me , shortly after that , that she had heard that Tim Russert , a nationally renowned journalist , had been talking about me on national T.V.
An essay I &apos;d written about my father , the year before he died , was in Tim &apos;s new book .
And he was doing the talk show circuit . And he was talking about my writing .
And when I realized that Tim Russert , former moderator of &quot; &quot; Meet the Press , &quot; &quot; was talking about my writing , while I was living in a van in a Wal-Mart parking lot , I started laughing .
You should too .
( Laughter ) I started laughing because it got to the point where , was I a writer , or was I a homeless woman ?
So I went in the bookstore . And I found Tim &apos;s book .
And I stood there . And I reread my essay .
And I cried .
Because I was a writer . I was a writer .
Shortly after that I moved back to Tennessee . I alternated between living in a van and couch surfing with friends . And I started writing again . By the summer of the following year I was a working journalist . I was winning awards . I was living in my own apartment . I was no longer homeless . And I was no longer invisible . Thousands of people work full and part-time jobs ,
and live in their cars .
But society continues to stigmatize and criminalize living in your vehicle or on the streets .
So the homeless , the working homeless , primarily remain invisible .
But if you ever meet one , engage them , encourage them , and offer them hope .
The human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope .
And I &apos;m not here to be the poster girl for the homeless .
I &apos;m not here to encourage you to give money to the next panhandler you meet .
But I am here to tell you that , based on my experience , people are not where they live , where they sleep , or what their life situation is at any given time .
Three years ago I was living in a van in a Wal-Mart parking lot , and today I &apos;m speaking at TED .
Hope always , always finds a way . Thank you .

You know , my favorite part of being a dad is the movies I get to watch .
I love sharing my favorite movies with my kids , and when my daughter was four , we got to watch &quot; &quot; The Wizard of Oz &quot; &quot; together .
It totally dominated her imagination for months .
Her favorite character was Glinda , of course .
It gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress and carry a wand .
But you watch that movie enough times , and you start to realize how unusual it is .
Now we live today , and are raising our children , in a kind of children &apos;s-fantasy-spectacular-industrial complex .
But &quot; &quot; The Wizard of Oz &quot; &quot; stood alone .
It did not start that trend .
Forty years later was when the trend really caught on , with , interestingly , another movie that featured a metal guy and a furry guy rescuing a girl by dressing up as the enemy &apos;s guards .
Do you know what I &apos;m talking about ? ( Laughter ) Yeah .
Now , there &apos;s a big difference between these two movies , a couple of really big differences between &quot; &quot; The Wizard of Oz &quot; &quot; and all the movies we watch today .
One is there &apos;s very little violence in &quot; &quot; The Wizard of Oz . &quot; &quot; The monkeys are rather aggressive , as are the apple trees .
But I think if &quot; &quot; The Wizard of Oz &quot; &quot; were made today , the wizard would say , &quot; &quot; Dorothy , you are the savior of Oz that the prophecy foretold .
Use your magic slippers to defeat the computer-generated armies of the Wicked Witch . &quot; &quot; But that &apos;s not how it happens .
Another thing that &apos;s really unique about &quot; &quot; The Wizard of Oz &quot; &quot; to me is that all of the most heroic and wise and even villainous characters are female .
Now I started to notice this when I actually showed &quot; &quot; Star Wars &quot; &quot; to my daughter , which was years later , and the situation was different .
At that point I also had a son .
He was only three at the time .
He was not invited to the screening . He was too young for that .
But he was the second child , and the level of supervision had plummeted . ( Laughter ) So he wandered in , and it imprinted on him like a mommy duck does to its duckling , and I don &apos;t think he understands what &apos;s going on , but he is sure soaking in it .
And I wonder what he &apos;s soaking in .
Is he picking up on the themes of courage and perseverance and loyalty ?
Is he picking up on the fact that Luke joins an army to overthrow the government ? Is he picking up on the fact that
there are only boys in the universe except for Aunt Beru , and of course this princess , who &apos;s really cool , but who kind of waits around through most of the movie so that she can award the hero with a medal and a wink to thank him for saving the universe , which he does by the magic that he was born with ?
Compare this to 1939 with &quot; &quot; The Wizard of Oz . &quot; &quot; How does Dorothy win her movie ?
By making friends with everybody and being a leader .
That &apos;s kind of the world I &apos;d rather raise my kids in — Oz , right ? — and not the world of dudes fighting , which is where we kind of have to be .
Why is there so much Force — capital F , Force — in the movies we have for our kids , and so little yellow brick road ?
There is a lot of great writing about the impact that the boy-violent movie has on girls , and you should do that reading . It &apos;s very good .
I haven &apos;t read as much on how boys are picking up on this vibe .
I know from my own experience that Princess Leia did not provide the adequate context that I could have used in navigating the adult world that is co-ed . ( Laughter ) I think there was a first-kiss moment when I really expected the credits to start rolling because that &apos;s the end of the movie , right ?
I finished my quest , I got the girl .
Why are you still standing there ?
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m supposed to do .
The movies are very , very focused on defeating the villain and getting your reward , and there &apos;s not a lot of room for other relationships and other journeys .
It &apos;s almost as though if you &apos;re a boy , you are a dopey animal , and if you are a girl , you should bring your warrior costume .
There are plenty of exceptions , and I will defend the Disney princesses in front of any you .
But they do send a message to boys , that they are not , the boys are not really the target audience .
They are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend against the patriarchy , but they are not necessarily showing boys how they &apos;re supposed to defend against the patriarchy .
There &apos;s no models for them .
And we also have some terrific women who are writing new stories for our kids , and as three-dimensional and delightful as Hermione and Katniss are , these are still war movies .
And , of course , the most successful studio of all time continues to crank out classic after classic , every single one of them about the journey of a boy , or a man , or two men who are friends , or a man and his son , or two men who are raising a little girl .
Until , as many of you are thinking , this year , when they finally came out with &quot; &quot; Brave . &quot; &quot; I recommend it to all of you . It &apos;s on demand now .
Do you remember what the critics said when &quot; &quot; Brave &quot; &quot; came out ?
&quot; Aw , I can &apos;t believe Pixar made a princess movie . &quot;
It &apos;s very good . Don &apos;t let that stop you .
Now , almost none of these movies pass the Bechdel Test .
I don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard of this .
It has not yet caught on and caught fire , but maybe today we will start a movement .
Alison Bechdel is a comic book artist , and back in the mid- &apos; 80s , she recorded this conversation she &apos;d had with a friend about assessing the movies that they saw .
And it &apos;s very simple . There &apos;s just three questions you should ask : Is there more than one character in the movie that is female who has lines ?
So try to meet that bar .
And do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie ?
And is their conversation about something other than the guy that they both like ? ( Laughter ) Right ? Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much .
Two women who exist and talk to each other about stuff .
It does happen . I &apos;ve seen it , and yet I very rarely see it in the movies that we know and love .
In fact , this week I went to see a very high-quality movie , &quot; &quot; Argo . &quot; &quot; Right ? Oscar buzz , doing great at the box office , a consensus idea of what a quality Hollywood film is .
It pretty much flunks the Bechdel test .
And I don &apos;t think it should , because a lot of the movie , I don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve seen it , but a lot of the movie takes place in this embassy where men and women are hiding out during the hostage crisis .
We &apos;ve got quite a few scenes of the men having deep , angst-ridden conversations in this hideout , and the great moment for one of the actresses is to peek through the door and say , &quot; &quot; Are you coming to bed , honey ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s Hollywood for you .
So let &apos;s look at the numbers .
2011 , of the 100 most popular movies , how many of them do you think actually have female protagonists ?
Eleven . It &apos;s not bad .
It &apos;s not as many percent as the number of women we &apos;ve just elected to Congress , so that &apos;s good .
But there is a number that is greater than this that &apos;s going to bring this room down .
Last year , The New York Times published a study that the government had done .
Here &apos;s what it said .
One out of five women in America say that they have been sexually assaulted some time in their life .
Now , I don &apos;t think that &apos;s the fault of popular entertainment .
I don &apos;t think kids &apos; movies have anything to do with that .
I don &apos;t even think that music videos or pornography are really directly related to that , but something is going wrong , and when I hear that statistic , one of the things I think of is that &apos;s a lot of sexual assailants .
Who are these guys ? What are they learning ?
What are they failing to learn ?
Are they absorbing the story that a male hero &apos;s job is to defeat the villain with violence and then collect the reward , which is a woman who has no friends and doesn &apos;t speak ?
Are we soaking up that story ?
You know , as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter like all of you who are doing the same thing , we find this world and this statistic very alarming and we want to prepare them .
We have tools at our disposal like &quot; &quot; girl power , &quot; &quot; and we hope that that will help , but I gotta wonder , is girl power going to protect them if , at the same time , actively or passively , we are training our sons to maintain their boy power ?
I mean , I think the Netflix queue is one way that we can do something very important , and I &apos;m talking mainly to the dads here .
I think we have got to show our sons a new definition of manhood .
The definition of manhood is already turning upside down .
You &apos;ve read about how the new economy is changing the roles of caregiver and wage earner .
They &apos;re throwing it up in the air .
So our sons are going to have to find some way of adapting to this , some new relationship with each other , and I think we really have to show them , and model for them , how a real man is someone who trusts his sisters and respects them , and wants to be on their team , and stands up against the real bad guys , who are the men who want to abuse the women .
And I think our job in the Netflix queue is to look out for those movies that pass the Bechdel Test , if we can find them , and to seek out the heroines who are there , who show real courage , who bring people together , and to nudge our sons to identify with those heroines and to say , &quot; &quot; I want to be on their team , &quot; &quot; because they &apos;re going to be on their team .
When I asked my daughter who her favorite character was in &quot; &quot; Star Wars , &quot; &quot; do you know what she said ?
Obi-Wan .
Obi-Wan Kenobi and Glinda .
What do these two have in common ?
Maybe it &apos;s not just the sparkly dress .
I think these people are experts .
I think these are the two people in the movie who know more than anybody else , and they love sharing their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential .
Now , they are leaders .
I like that kind of quest for my daughter , and I like that kind of quest for my son .
I want more quests like that .
I want fewer quests where my son is told , &quot; Go out and fight it alone , &quot; and more quests where he sees that it &apos;s his job to join a team , maybe a team led by women , to help other people become better and be better people , like the Wizard of Oz .
Thank you .
I &apos;ve spent the last decade subjecting myself to pain and humiliation , hopefully for a good cause , which is self-improvement .
And I &apos;ve done this in three parts .
So first I started with the mind .
And I decided to try to get smarter by reading the entire Encyclopedia Britannica from A to Z — or , more precisely , from &quot; &quot; a-ak &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; Zywiec . &quot; &quot; And here &apos;s a little image of that .
And this was an amazing year .
It was really a fascinating journey .
It was painful at times , especially for those around me .
My wife started to fine me one dollar for every irrelevant fact I inserted into conversation .
So it had its downsides .
But after that , I decided to work on the spirit .
As I mentioned last year , I grew up with no religion at all .
I &apos;m Jewish , but I &apos;m Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian .
( Laughter ) Not really .
But I decided to learn about the Bible and my heritage by actually diving in and trying to live it and immerse myself in it .
So I decided to follow all the rules of the Bible .
And from the Ten Commandments to growing my beard — because Leviticus says you cannot shave .
So this is what I looked like by the end .
Thank you for that reaction .
( Laughter ) I look a little like Moses , or Ted Kaczynski .
I got both of them .
So there was the topiary there .
And there &apos;s the sheep .
Now the final part of the trilogy was I wanted to focus on the body and try to be the healthiest person I could be , the healthiest person alive .
So that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been doing the last couple of years .
And I just finished a couple of months ago .
And I have to say , thank God .
Because living so healthily was killing me .
( Laughter ) It was so overwhelming , because the amount of things you have to do , it &apos;s just mind-boggling .
I was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers .
And they were telling me all the things I had to do .
I had to eat right , exercise , meditate , pet dogs , because that lowers the blood pressure .
I wrote the book on a treadmill , and it took me about a thousand miles to write the book .
I had to put on sunscreen .
This was no small feat , because if you listen to dermatologists , they say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen .
And you have to reapply it every two to four hours .
So I think half of my book advance went into sunscreen .
I was like a glazed doughnut for most of the year .
There was the washing of hands .
I had to do that properly .
And my immunologist told me that I should also wipe down all of the remote controls and iPhones in my house , because those are just orgies of germs .
So that took a lot of time .
I also tried to be the safest person I could be , because that &apos;s a part of health .
I was inspired by the Danish Safety Council .
They started a public campaign that says , &quot; &quot; A walking helmet is a good helmet . &quot; &quot; So they believe you should not just wear helmets for biking , but also for walking around .
And you can see there they &apos;re shopping with their helmets .
( Laughter ) Well yeah , I tried that .
Now it &apos;s a little extreme , I admit .
But if you think about this , this is actually — the &quot; &quot; Freakonomics &quot; &quot; authors wrote about this — that more people die on a per mile basis from drunk walking than from drunk driving .
So something to think about tonight if you &apos;ve had a couple .
So I finished , and it was a success in a sense .
All of the markers went in the right direction .
My cholesterol went down , I lost weight , my wife stopped telling me that I looked pregnant .
So that was nice .
And it was successful overall .
But I also learned that I was too healthy , and that was unhealthy .
I was so focused on doing all these things that I was neglecting my friends and family .
And as Dan Buettner can tell you , having a strong social network is so crucial to our health .
So I finished .
And I kind of went overboard on the week after the project was over .
I went to the dark side , and I just indulged myself .
It was like something out of Caligula .
( Laughter ) Without the sex part .
Because I have three young kids , so that wasn &apos;t happening .
But the over-eating and over-drinking , definitely .
And I finally have stabilized .
So now I &apos;m back to adopting many — not all ; I don &apos;t wear a helmet anymore — but dozens of healthy behaviors that I adopted during my year .
It was really a life-changing project .
And I , of course , don &apos;t have time to go into all of them .
Let me just tell you two really quickly .
The first is — and this was surprising to me ; I didn &apos;t expect this to come out — but I live a much quieter life now .
Because we live in such a noisy world .
There &apos;s trains and planes and cars and Bill O &apos;Reilly , he &apos;s very noisy .
( Laughter ) And this is a real underestimated , under-appreciated health hazard — not just because it harms our hearing , which it obviously does , but it actually initiates the fight-or-flight response .
A loud noise will get your fight-or-flight response going .
And this , over the years , can cause real damage , cardiovascular damage .
The World Health Organization just did a big study that they published this year .
And it was done in Europe .
And they estimated that 1.6 million years of healthy living are lost every year in Europe because of noise pollution .
So they think it &apos;s actually very deadly .
And by the way , it &apos;s also terrible for your brain .
It really impairs cognition .
And our Founding Fathers knew about this .
When they wrote the Constitution , they put dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hall so that they could concentrate .
So without noise reduction technology , our country would not exist .
So as a patriot , I felt it was important to — I wear all the earplugs and the earphones , and it &apos;s really improved my life in a surprising and unexpected way .
And the second point I want to make , the final point , is that — and it &apos;s actually been a theme of TEDMED — that joy is so important to your health , that very few of these behaviors will stick with me unless there &apos;s some sense of pleasure and joy in them .
And just to give you one instance of this : food .
The junk food industry is really great at pressing our pleasure buttons and figuring out what &apos;s the most pleasurable .
But I think we can use their techniques and apply them to healthy food .
To give just one example , we love crunchiness , mouthfeel .
So I basically have tried to incorporate crunchiness into a lot of my recipes — throw in some sunflower seeds .
And you can almost trick yourself into thinking you &apos;re eating Doritos .
( Laughter ) And it has made me a healthier person .
So that is it .
The book about it comes out in April .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Drop Dead Healthy . &quot; &quot; And I hope that I don &apos;t get sick during the book tour .
That &apos;s my greatest hope .
So thank you very much .
( Applause )
Good morning . How are you ?
I have an interest in education .
And yet we &apos;re meant to be educating them for it .
Shakespeare being seven ?
I &apos;ve got two kids ; he &apos;s 21 now , my daughter &apos;s 16 .
He didn &apos;t want to come to Los Angeles .
They &apos;re just a form of life , another form of life .
The brain isn &apos;t divided into compartments .
Because you are , aren &apos;t you ?
If I &apos;m cooking , the door is shut , the kids are out , the phone &apos;s on the hook , if she comes in I get annoyed .
Take her to a dance school . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What happened ? &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; She did . I can &apos;t tell you how wonderful it was .
We walked in this room and it was full of people like me .
People who had to move to think . &quot; &quot; Who had to move to think .
So there are a few things that bring us humans together in the way that an election does .
We stand in elections ; we vote in elections ; we observe elections .
Our democracies rely on elections .
We all understand why we have elections , and we all leave the house on the same day to go and vote .
We cherish the opportunity to have our say , to help decide the future of the country .
The fundamental idea is that politicians are given mandate to speak for us , to make decisions on our behalf that affect us all .
Without that mandate , they would be corrupt .
Well unfortunately , power corrupts , and so people will do lots of things to get power and to stay in power , including doing bad things to elections .
You see , even if the idea of the election is perfect , running a countrywide election is a big project , and big projects are messy .
Whenever there is an election , it seems like something always goes wrong , someone tries to cheat , or something goes accidentally awry — a ballot box goes missing here , chads are left hanging over here .
To make sure as few things as possible go wrong , we have all these procedures around the election .
So for example , you come to the polling station , and a poll station worker asks for your ID before giving you a ballot form and asking you to go into a voting booth to fill out your vote .
When you come back out , you get to drop your vote into the ballot box where it mixes with all the other votes , so that no one knows how you voted .
Well , what I want us to think about for a moment is what happens after that , after you drop your vote into the ballot box .
And most people would go home and feel sure that their vote has been counted , because they trust that the election system works .
They trust that election workers and election observers do their jobs and do their jobs correctly .
The ballot boxes go to counting places .
They &apos;re unsealed and the votes are poured out and laboriously counted .
Most of us have to trust that that happens correctly for our own vote , and we all have to trust that that happens correctly for all the votes in the election .
So we have to trust a lot of people .
We have to trust a lot of procedures .
And sometimes we even have to trust computers .
So imagine hundreds of millions of voters casting hundreds of millions of votes , all to be counted correctly and all the things that can possibly go wrong causing all these bad headlines , and you cannot help but feel exhausted at the idea of trying to make elections better .
Well in the face of all these bad headlines , researchers have taken a step back and thought about how we can do elections differently .
They &apos;ve zoomed out and looked at the big picture .
And the big picture is this : elections should be verifiable .
Voters should be able to check that their votes are counted correctly , without breaking election secrecy , which is so very important .
And that &apos;s the tough part .
How do we make an election system completely verifiable while keeping the votes absolutely secret ?
Well , the way we &apos;ve come up with uses computers but doesn &apos;t depend on them .
And the secret is the ballot form .
And if you look closely at these ballot forms , you &apos;ll notice that the candidate list is in a different order on each one .
And that means , if you mark your choices on one of them and then remove the candidate list , I won &apos;t be able to tell from the bit remaining what your vote is for .
And on each ballot form there is this encrypted value in the form of this 2D barcode on the right .
And there &apos;s some complicated cryptography going on in there , but what &apos;s not complicated is voting with one of these forms .
So we can let computers do all the complicated cryptography for us , and then we &apos;ll use the paper for verification .
So this is how you vote .
You get one of these ballot forms at random , and then you go into the voting booth , and you mark your choices , and you tear along a perforation .
And you shred the candidate list .
And the bit that remains , the one with your marks — this is your encrypted vote .
So you let a poll station worker scan your encrypted vote .
And because it &apos;s encrypted , it can be submitted , stored and counted centrally and displayed on a website for anyone to see , including you .
So you take this encrypted vote home as your receipt .
And after the close of the election , you can check that your vote was counted by comparing your receipt to the vote on the website .
And remember , the vote is encrypted from the moment you leave the voting booth , so if an election official wants to find out how you voted , they will not be able to .
If the government wants to find out how you voted , they won &apos;t be able to .
No hacker can break in and find out how you voted .
No hacker can break in and change your vote , because then it won &apos;t match your receipt .
Votes can &apos;t go missing because then you won &apos;t find yours when you look for it .
But the election magic doesn &apos;t stop there .
Instead , we want to make the whole process so transparent that news media and international observers and anyone who wants to can download all the election data and do the count themselves .
They can check that all the votes were counted correctly . They can check
that the announced result of the election is the correct one .
And these are elections by the people , for the people .
So the next step for our democracies are transparent and verifiable elections .
We &apos;re at a tipping point in human history , a species poised between gaining the stars and losing the planet we call home .
Even in just the past few years , we &apos;ve greatly expanded our knowledge of how Earth fits within the context of our universe .
NASA &apos;s Kepler mission has discovered thousands of potential planets around other stars , indicating that Earth is but one of billions of planets in our galaxy .
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the subtle dimming of stars as planets pass in front of them , blocking just a little bit of that light from reaching us .
Kepler &apos;s data reveals planets &apos; sizes as well as their distance from their parent star .
Together , this helps us understand whether these planets are small and rocky , like the terrestrial planets in our own Solar System , and also how much light they receive from their parent sun .
In turn , this provides clues as to whether these planets that we discover might be habitable or not .
Unfortunately , at the same time as we &apos;re discovering this treasure trove of potentially habitable worlds , our own planet is sagging under the weight of humanity .
2014 was the hottest year on record .
Glaciers and sea ice that have been with us for millennia are now disappearing in a matter of decades .
These planetary-scale environmental changes that we have set in motion are rapidly outpacing our ability to alter their course .
But I &apos;m not a climate scientist , I &apos;m an astronomer .
I study planetary habitability as influenced by stars with the hopes of finding the places in the universe where we might discover life beyond our own planet .
You could say that I look for choice alien real estate .
Now , as somebody who is deeply embedded in the search for life in the universe , I can tell you that the more you look for planets like Earth , the more you appreciate our own planet itself .
Each one of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets we know best : those of our own Solar System .
Consider our neighbor , Mars .
Mars is small and rocky , and though it &apos;s a bit far from the Sun , it might be considered a potentially habitable world if found by a mission like Kepler .
Indeed , it &apos;s possible that Mars was habitable in the past , and in part , this is why we study Mars so much .
Our rovers , like Curiosity , crawl across its surface , scratching for clues as to the origins of life as we know it .
Orbiters like the MAVEN mission sample the Martian atmosphere , trying to understand how Mars might have lost its past habitability .
Private spaceflight companies now offer not just a short trip to near space but the tantalizing possibility of living our lives on Mars .
But though these Martian vistas resemble the deserts of our own home world , places that are tied in our imagination to ideas about pioneering and frontiers , compared to Earth Mars is a pretty terrible place to live .
Consider the extent to which we have not colonized the deserts of our own planet , places that are lush by comparison with Mars .
Even in the driest , highest places on Earth , the air is sweet and thick with oxygen exhaled from thousands of miles away by our rainforests .
I worry — I worry that this excitement about colonizing Mars and other planets carries with it a long , dark shadow : the implication and belief by some that Mars will be there to save us from the self-inflicted destruction of the only truly habitable planet we know of , the Earth .
As much as I love interplanetary exploration , I deeply disagree with this idea .
There are many excellent reasons to go to Mars , but for anyone to tell you that Mars will be there to back up humanity is like the captain of the Titanic telling you that the real party is happening later on the lifeboats .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you .
But the goals of interplanetary exploration and planetary preservation are not opposed to one another .
No , they &apos;re in fact two sides of the same goal : to understand , preserve and improve life into the future .
The extreme environments of our own world are alien vistas .
They &apos;re just closer to home .
If we can understand how to create and maintain habitable spaces out of hostile , inhospitable spaces here on Earth , perhaps we can meet the needs of both preserving our own environment and moving beyond it .
I leave you with a final thought experiment : Fermi &apos;s paradox .
Many years ago , the physicist Enrico Fermi asked that , given the fact that our universe has been around for a very long time and we expect that there are many planets within it , we should have found evidence for alien life by now .
So where are they ?
Well , one possible solution to Fermi &apos;s paradox is that , as civilizations become technologically advanced enough to consider living amongst the stars , they lose sight of how important it is to safeguard the home worlds that fostered that advancement to begin with .
It is hubris to believe that interplanetary colonization alone will save us from ourselves , but planetary preservation and interplanetary exploration can work together .
If we truly believe in our ability to bend the hostile environments of Mars for human habitation , then we should be able to surmount the far easier task of preserving the habitability of the Earth .
Thank you .

In the past few months , I &apos;ve been traveling for weeks at a time with only one suitcase of clothes .
One day , I was invited to an important event , and I wanted to wear something special and new for it .
So I looked through my suitcase and I couldn &apos;t find anything to wear .
I was lucky to be at the technology conference on that day , and I had access to 3D printers .
So I quickly designed a skirt on my computer , and I loaded the file on the printer .
It just printed the pieces overnight .
The next morning , I just took all the pieces , assembled them together in my hotel room , and this is actually the skirt that I &apos;m wearing right now .
( Applause ) So it wasn &apos;t the first time that I printed clothes .
For my senior collection at fashion design school , I decided to try and 3D print an entire fashion collection from my home .
The problem was that I barely knew anything about 3D printing , and I had only nine months to figure out how to print five fashionable looks .
I always felt most creative when I worked from home .
I loved experimenting with new materials , and I always tried to develop new techniques to make the most unique textiles for my fashion projects .
I loved going to old factories and weird stores in search of leftovers of strange powders and weird materials , and then bring them home to experiment on .
As you can probably imagine , my roommates didn &apos;t like that at all .
( Laughter ) So I decided to move on to working with big machines , ones that didn &apos;t fit in my living room .
I love the exact and the custom work I can do with all kinds of fashion technologies , like knitting machines and laser cutting and silk printing .
One summer break , I came here to New York for an internship at a fashion house in Chinatown .
We worked on two incredible dresses that were 3D printed .
They were amazing — like you can see here .
But I had a few issues with them .
They were made from hard plastics and that &apos;s why they were very breakable .
The models couldn &apos;t sit in them , and they even got scratched from the plastics under their arms .
With 3D printing , the designers had so much freedom to make the dresses look exactly like they wanted , but still , they were very dependent on big and expensive industrial printers that were located in a lab far from their studio .
Later that year , a friend gave me a 3D printed necklace , printed using a home printer .
I knew that these printers were much cheaper and much more accessible than the ones we used at my internship .
So I looked at the necklace , and then I thought , &quot; &quot; If I can print a necklace from home , why not print my clothes from home , too ? &quot; &quot; I really liked the idea that I wouldn &apos;t have to go to the market and pick fabrics that someone else chose to sell — I could just design them and print them directly from home .
I found a small makerspace , where I learned everything I know about 3D printing .
Right away , they literally gave me the key to the lab , so I could experiment into the night , every night .
The main challenge was to find the right filament for printing clothes with .
So what is a filament ?
Filament is the material you feed the printer with .
And I spent a month or so experimenting with PLA , which is a hard and scratchy , breakable material .
The breakthrough came when I was introduced to Filaflex , which is a new kind of filament .
It &apos;s strong , yet very flexible .
And with it , I was able to print the first garment , the red jacket that had the word &quot; &quot; Liberté &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; freedom &quot; &quot; in French — embedded into it .
I chose this word because I felt so empowered and free when I could just design a garment from my home and then print it by myself .
And actually , you can easily download this jacket , and easily change the word to something else .
For example , your name or your sweetheart &apos;s name .
( Laughter ) So the printer plates are small , so I had to piece the garment together , just like a puzzle .
And I wanted to solve another challenge .
I wanted to print textiles that I would use just like regular fabrics .
That &apos;s when I found an open-source file from an architect who designed a pattern that I love .
And with it , I was able to print a beautiful textile that I would use just like a regular fabric .
And it actually even looks a little bit like lace .
So I took his file and I modified it , and changed it , played with it — many kinds of versions out of it .
And I needed to print another 1,500 more hours to complete printing my collection .
So I brought six printers to my home and just printed 24-7 .
And this is actually a really slow process , but let &apos;s remember the Internet was significantly slower 20 years ago , so 3D printing will also accelerate and in no time you &apos;ll be able to print a T-Shirt in your home in just a couple of hours , or even minutes .
So you guys , you want to see what it looks like ?
Audience : Yeah !
( Applause ) Danit Peleg : Rebecca is wearing one of my five outfits .
Almost everything here she &apos;s wearing , I printed from my home .
Even her shoes are printed .
Audience : Wow !
Audience : Cool !
( Applause ) Danit Peleg : Thank you , Rebecca .
( To audience ) Thank you , guys .
So I think in the future , materials will evolve , and they will look and feel like fabrics we know today , like cotton or silk .
Imagine personalized clothes that fit exactly to your measurements .
Music was once a very physical thing .
You would have to go to the record shop and buy CDs , but now you can just download the music — digital music — directly to your phone .
Fashion is also a very physical thing .
And I wonder what our world will look like when our clothes will be digital , just like this skirt is .
Thank you so much .
( Applause ) &#91; Thank You &#93; ( Applause )
Alec Soth : So about 10 years ago , I got a call from a woman in Texas , Stacey Baker , and she &apos;d seen some of my photographs in an art exhibition and was wondering if she could commission me to take a portrait of her parents .
Now , at the time I hadn &apos;t met Stacey , and I thought this was some sort of wealthy oil tycoon and I &apos;d struck it rich , but it was only later that I found out she &apos;d actually taken out a loan to make this happen .
I took the picture of her parents , but I was actually more excited about photographing Stacey .
The picture I made that day ended up becoming one of my best-known portraits .
At the time I made this picture , Stacey was working as an attorney for the State of Texas .
Not long after , she left her job to study photography in Maine , and while she was there , she ended up meeting the director of photography at the New York Times Magazine and was actually offered a job .
Stacey Baker : In the years since , Alec and I have done a number of magazine projects together , and we &apos;ve become friends .
A few months ago , I started talking to Alec about a fascination of mine .
I &apos;ve always been obsessed with how couples meet .
I asked Alec how he and his wife Rachel met , and he told me the story of a high school football game where she was 16 and he was 15 , and he asked her out .
He liked her purple hair .
She said yes , and that was it .
I then asked Alec if he &apos;d be interested in doing a photography project exploring this question .
AS : And I was interested in the question , but I was actually much more interested in Stacey &apos;s motivation for asking it , particularly since I &apos;d never known Stacey to have a boyfriend .
So as part of this project , I thought it &apos;d be interesting if she tried to meet someone .
So my idea was to have Stacey here go speed dating in Las Vegas on Valentine &apos;s Day .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) SB : We ended up at what was advertised as the world &apos;s largest speed dating event .
I had 19 dates and each date lasted three minutes .
Participants were given a list of ice- breaker questions to get the ball rolling , things like , &quot; &quot; If you could be any kind of animal , what would you be ? &quot; &quot; That sort of thing .
My first date was Colin .
He &apos;s from England , and he once married a woman he met after placing an ad for a Capricorn .
Alec and I saw him at the end of the evening , and he said he &apos;d kissed a woman in line at one of the concession stands .
Zack and Chris came to the date-a-thon together .
This is Carl .
I asked Carl , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the first thing you notice about a woman ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Tits . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Matthew is attracted to women with muscular calves .
We talked about running . He does triathlons , I run half-marathons .
Alec actually liked his eyes and asked if I was attracted to him , but I wasn &apos;t , and I don &apos;t think he was attracted to me either .
Austin and Mike came together .
Mike asked me a hypothetical question .
He said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re in an elevator running late for a meeting .
Someone makes a dash for the elevator .
Do you hold it open for them ? &quot; &quot; And I said I would not .
( Laughter ) Cliff said the first thing he notices about a woman is her teeth , and we complimented each other &apos;s teeth .
Because he &apos;s an open mouth sleeper , he says he has to floss more to help prevent gum disease , and so I asked him how often he flosses , and he said , &quot; &quot; Every other day . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , as someone who flosses twice a day , I wasn &apos;t really sure that that was flossing more but I don &apos;t think I said that out loud .
Bill is an auditor , and we talked the entire three minutes about auditing . ( Laughter ) The first thing Spencer notices about a woman is her complexion .
He feels a lot of women wear too much makeup , and that they should only wear enough to accentuate the features that they have .
I told him I didn &apos;t wear any makeup at all and he seemed to think that that was a good thing .
Craig told me he didn &apos;t think I was willing to be vulnerable .
He was also frustrated when I couldn &apos;t remember my most embarrassing moment .
He thought I was lying , but I wasn &apos;t .
I didn &apos;t think he liked me at all , but at the end of the night , he came back to me and he gave me a box of chocolates .
William was really difficult to talk to .
I think he was drunk .
( Laughter ) Actor Chris McKenna was the MC of the event .
He used to be on &quot; &quot; The Young and the Restless . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t actually go on a date with him .
Alec said he saw several women give their phone numbers to him .
Needless to say , I didn &apos;t fall in love .
I didn &apos;t feel a particular connection with any of the men that I went on dates with , and I didn &apos;t feel like they felt a particular connection with me either .
AS : Now , the most beautiful thing to me — ( Laughter ) — as a photographer is the quality of vulnerability .
The physical exterior reveals a crack in which you can get a glimpse at a more fragile interior .
At this date-a-thon event , I saw so many examples of that , but as I watched Stacey &apos;s dates and talked to her about them , I realized how different photographic love is from real love .
What is real love ? How does it work ?
In order to work on this question and to figure out how someone goes from meeting on a date to having a life together , Stacey and I went to Sun City Summerlin , which is the largest retirement community in Las Vegas .
Our contact there was George , who runs the community &apos;s photography club .
He arranged for us to meet other couples in their makeshift photo studio .
SB : After 45 years of marriage , Anastasia &apos;s husband died two years ago , so we asked if she had an old wedding picture .
She met her husband when she was a 15-year-old waitress at a small barbecue place in Michigan .
He was 30 .
She &apos;d lied about her age .
He was the first person she &apos;d dated .
Dean had been named photographer of the year in Las Vegas two years in a row , and this caught Alec &apos;s attention , as did the fact that he met his wife , Judy , at the same age when Alec met Rachel .
Dean admitted that he likes to look at beautiful women , but he &apos;s never questioned his decision to marry Judy .
AS : George met Josephine at a parish dance .
He was 18 , she was 15 .
Like a lot of the couples we met , they weren &apos;t especially philosophical about their early choices .
George said something that really stuck with me .
He said , &quot; &quot; When you get that feeling , you just go with it . &quot; &quot; Bob and Trudy met on a blind date when she was still in high school .
They said they weren &apos;t particularly attracted to each other when the first met .
Nevertheless , they were married soon after .
SB : The story that stayed with me the most was that of George , the photography club president , and his wife , Mary .
This was George and Mary &apos;s second marriage .
They met at a country-western club in Louisville , Kentucky called the Sahara .
He was there alone drinking and she was with friends .
When they started dating , he owed the IRS 9,000 dollars in taxes , and she offered to help him get out of debt , so for the next year , he turned his paychecks over to Mary , and she got him out of debt .
George was actually an alcoholic when they married , and Mary knew it .
At some point in their marriage , he says he consumed 54 beers in one day .
Another time , when he was drunk , he threatened to kill Mary and her two kids , but they escaped and a SWAT team was called to the house .
Amazingly , Mary took him back , and eventually things got better .
George has been involved in Alcoholics Anonymous and hasn &apos;t had a drink in 36 years .
( Music ) At the end of the day , after we left Sun City , I told Alec that I didn &apos;t actually think that the stories of how these couples met were all that interesting .
What was more interesting was how they managed to stay together .
AS : They all had this beautiful quality of endurance , but that was true of the singles , too .
The world is hard , and the singles were out there trying to connect with other people , and the couples were holding onto each other after all these decades .
My favorite pictures on this trip were of Joe and Roseanne .
Now , by the time we met Joe and Roseanne , we &apos;d gotten in the habit of asking couples if they had an old wedding photograph .
In their case , they simultaneously pulled out of their wallets the exact same photograph .
What &apos;s more beautiful , I thought to myself , this image of a young couple who has just fallen in love or the idea of these two people holding onto this image for decades ?
Thank you .

The human voice : It &apos;s the instrument we all play .
And why is that ?
How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world ?
I &apos;m not pretending this is an exhaustive list , but these seven , I think , are pretty large habits that we can all fall into .
First , gossip .
Speaking ill of somebody who &apos;s not present .
Second , judging .
Third , negativity .
It &apos;s our national sport .
Excuses .
It demeans our language , actually , sometimes .
For example , if I see something that really is awesome , what do I call it ?
When those two things get conflated , you &apos;re listening into the wind .
So here they are , seven deadly sins of speaking .
These are things I think we need to avoid .
But is there a positive way to think about this ?
Yes , there is .
The word is &quot; &quot; hail , &quot; &quot; and it has a great definition as well .
See if you can guess .
The A is authenticity , just being yourself .
A friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth , which I think is a lovely way to put it .
The I is integrity , being your word , actually doing what you say , and being somebody people can trust .
I don &apos;t mean romantic love , but I do mean wishing people well , for two reasons .
First of all , I think absolute honesty may not be what we want .
Perhaps that &apos;s not necessary .
Tempered with love , of course , honesty is a great thing .
But also , if you &apos;re really wishing somebody well , it &apos;s very hard to judge them at the same time .
I &apos;m not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously .
So hail .
This instrument is incredible , and yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened .
Now , falsetto register may not be very useful most of the time , but there &apos;s a register in between .
You hear the difference ?
We vote for politicians with lower voices , it &apos;s true , because we associate depth with power and with authority .
That &apos;s register .
Then we have timbre .
It &apos;s the way your voice feels .
Well if that &apos;s not you , that &apos;s not the end of the world , because you can train .
Go and get a voice coach .
Then prosody . I love prosody .
This is the sing-song , the meta-language that we use in order to impart meaning .
It &apos;s root one for meaning in conversation .
People who speak all on one note are really quite hard to listen to if they don &apos;t have any prosody at all .
That &apos;s where the word &quot; &quot; monotonic &quot; &quot; comes from , or monotonous , monotone .
Also , we have repetitive prosody now coming in , where every sentence ends as if it were a question when it &apos;s actually not a question , it &apos;s a statement ?
There &apos;s nothing wrong with a bit of silence in a talk , is there ?
We don &apos;t have to fill it with ums and ahs .
Of course , pitch often goes along with pace to indicate arousal , but you can do it just with pitch .
( Higher pitch ) Where did you leave my keys ?
And finally , volume .
( Loud ) I can get really excited by using volume .
Sorry about that , if I startled anybody .
Or , I can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet .
Warm up your voice .
Any time you &apos;re going to talk to anybody important , do these .
One more time .
Ahhhh , very good .
Now we &apos;re going to warm up our lips , and we &apos;re going to go Ba , Ba , Ba , Ba , Ba , Ba , Ba , Ba . Very good .
And now , brrrrrrrrrr , just like when you were a kid .
Beautiful . You &apos;re getting really good at this .
That &apos;s like champagne for the tongue .
Finally , and if I can only do one , the pros call this the siren .
Fantastic . Give yourselves a round of applause .
Now let me just put this in context to close .
This is a serious point here .
This is where we are now , right ?
What would the world be like if we were speaking powerfully to people who were listening consciously in environments which were actually fit for purpose ?
Thank you .
I grew up on a steady diet of science fiction .
In high school , I took a bus to school an hour each way every day .
And I was always absorbed in a book , science fiction book , which took my mind to other worlds , and satisfied , in a narrative form , this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had .
And you know , that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever I wasn &apos;t in school I was out in the woods , hiking and taking &quot; &quot; samples &quot; &quot; — frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water — and bringing it back , looking at it under the microscope .
You know , I was a real science geek .
But it was all about trying to understand the world , understand the limits of possibility .
And my love of science fiction actually seemed mirrored in the world around me , because what was happening , this was in the late &apos; 60s , we were going to the moon , we were exploring the deep oceans .
Jacques Cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places and a wondrous world that we could never really have previously imagined .
So , that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it .
And I was an artist .
I could draw . I could paint .
And I found that because there weren &apos;t video games and this saturation of CG movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape , I had to create these images in my head .
You know , we all did , as kids having to read a book , and through the author &apos;s description , put something on the movie screen in our heads .
And so , my response to this was to paint , to draw alien creatures , alien worlds , robots , spaceships , all that stuff .
I was endlessly getting busted in math class doodling behind the textbook .
That was — the creativity had to find its outlet somehow .
And an interesting thing happened : The Jacques Cousteau shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on Earth .
I might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday — that seemed pretty darn unlikely .
But that was a world I could really go to , right here on Earth , that was as rich and exotic as anything that I had imagined from reading these books .
So , I decided I was going to become a scuba diver at the age of 15 .
And the only problem with that was that I lived in a little village in Canada , 600 miles from the nearest ocean .
But I didn &apos;t let that daunt me .
I pestered my father until he finally found a scuba class in Buffalo , New York , right across the border from where we live .
And I actually got certified in a pool at a YMCA in the dead of winter in Buffalo , New York .
And I didn &apos;t see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to California .
Since then , in the intervening 40 years , I &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours underwater , and 500 hours of that was in submersibles .
And I &apos;ve learned that that deep-ocean environment , and even the shallow oceans , are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination .
Nature &apos;s imagination is so boundless compared to our own meager human imagination .
I still , to this day , stand in absolute awe of what I see when I make these dives .
And my love affair with the ocean is ongoing , and just as strong as it ever was .
But when I chose a career as an adult , it was filmmaking .
And that seemed to be the best way to reconcile this urge I had to tell stories with my urges to create images .
And I was , as a kid , constantly drawing comic books , and so on .
So , filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories together , and that made sense .
And of course the stories that I chose to tell were science fiction stories : &quot; &quot; Terminator , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aliens &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; The Abyss . &quot; &quot; And with &quot; &quot; The Abyss , &quot; &quot; I was putting together my love of underwater and diving with filmmaking .
So , you know , merging the two passions .
Something interesting came out of &quot; &quot; The Abyss , &quot; &quot; which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film , which was to create this kind of liquid water creature , we actually embraced computer generated animation , CG .
And this resulted in the first soft-surface character , CG animation that was ever in a movie .
And even though the film didn &apos;t make any money — barely broke even , I should say — I witnessed something amazing , which is that the audience , the global audience , was mesmerized by this apparent magic .
You know , it &apos;s Arthur Clarke &apos;s law that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic .
They were seeing something magical .
And so that got me very excited .
And I thought , &quot; &quot; Wow , this is something that needs to be embraced into the cinematic art . &quot; &quot; So , with &quot; &quot; Terminator 2 , &quot; &quot; which was my next film , we took that much farther .
Working with ILM , we created the liquid metal dude in that film . The success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work .
And it did , and we created magic again , and we had the same result with an audience — although we did make a little more money on that one .
So , drawing a line through those two dots of experience came to , &quot; &quot; This is going to be a whole new world , &quot; &quot; this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists .
So , I started a company with Stan Winston , my good friend Stan Winston , who is the premier make-up and creature designer at that time , and it was called Digital Domain .
And the concept of the company was that we would leapfrog past the analog processes of optical printers and so on , and we would go right to digital production .
And we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while .
But we found ourselves lagging in the mid &apos; 90s in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do .
So , I wrote this piece called &quot; &quot; Avatar , &quot; &quot; which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of visual effects , of CG effects , beyond , with realistic human emotive characters generated in CG , and the main characters would all be in CG , and the world would be in CG .
And the envelope pushed back , and I was told by the folks at my company that we weren &apos;t going to be able to do this for a while .
So , I shelved it , and I made this other movie about a big ship that sinks .
( Laughter ) You know , I went and pitched it to the studio as &quot; &quot; &apos; Romeo and Juliet &apos; on a ship : &quot; &quot; It &apos;s going to be this epic romance , passionate film . &quot; &quot; Secretly , what I wanted to do was I wanted to dive to the real wreck of &quot; &quot; Titanic . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s why I made the movie .
( Applause ) And that &apos;s the truth . Now , the studio didn &apos;t know that .
But I convinced them . I said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to dive to the wreck . We &apos;re going to film it for real .
We &apos;ll be using it in the opening of the film .
It will be really important . It will be a great marketing hook . &quot; &quot; And I talked them into funding an expedition .
( Laughter ) Sounds crazy . But this goes back to that theme about your imagination creating a reality .
Because we actually created a reality where six months later , I find myself in a Russian submersible two and a half miles down in the north Atlantic , looking at the real Titanic through a view port .
Not a movie , not HD — for real .
( Applause ) Now , that blew my mind .
And it took a lot of preparation , we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things .
But , it struck me how much this dive , these deep dives , was like a space mission .
You know , where it was highly technical , and it required enormous planning .
You get in this capsule , you go down to this dark hostile environment where there is no hope of rescue if you can &apos;t get back by yourself .
And I thought like , &quot; &quot; Wow . I &apos;m like , living in a science fiction movie .
This is really cool . &quot; &quot; And so , I really got bitten by the bug of deep-ocean exploration .
Of course , the curiosity , the science component of it — it was everything . It was adventure , it was curiosity , it was imagination .
And it was an experience that Hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
Because , you know , I could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it . But I couldn &apos;t imagine what I was seeing out that window .
As we did some of our subsequent expeditions , I was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents and sometimes things that I had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imaged them .
So , I was completely smitten by this , and had to do more .
And so , I actually made a kind of curious decision .
After the success of &quot; &quot; Titanic , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; OK , I &apos;m going to park my day job as a Hollywood movie maker , and I &apos;m going to go be a full-time explorer for a while . &quot; &quot; And so , we started planning these expeditions .
And we wound up going to the Bismark , and exploring it with robotic vehicles .
We went back to the Titanic wreck .
We took little bots that we had created that spooled a fiber optic .
And the idea was to go in and do an interior survey of that ship , which had never been done .
Nobody had ever looked inside the wreck . They didn &apos;t have the means to do it , so we created technology to do it .
So , you know , here I am now , on the deck of Titanic , sitting in a submersible , and looking out at planks that look much like this , where I knew that the band had played .
And I &apos;m flying a little robotic vehicle through the corridor of the ship .
When I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m operating it , &quot; &quot; but my mind is in the vehicle .
I felt like I was physically present inside the shipwreck of Titanic .
And it was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience I &apos;ve ever had , because I would know before I turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it , because I had walked the set for months when we were making the movie .
And the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprints of the ship .
So , it was this absolutely remarkable experience .
And it really made me realize that the telepresence experience — that you actually can have these robotic avatars , then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle , into this other form of existence .
It was really , really quite profound .
And it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post-human futures that I can imagine , as a science fiction fan .
So , having done these expeditions , and really beginning to appreciate what was down there , such as at the deep ocean vents where we had these amazing , amazing animals — they &apos;re basically aliens right here on Earth .
They live in an environment of chemosynthesis .
They don &apos;t survive on sunlight-based system the way we do .
And so , you &apos;re seeing animals that are living next to a 500-degree-Centigrade water plumes .
You think they can &apos;t possibly exist .
At the same time I was getting very interested in space science as well — again , it &apos;s the science fiction influence , as a kid .
And I wound up getting involved with the space community , really involved with NASA , sitting on the NASA advisory board , planning actual space missions , going to Russia , going through the pre-cosmonaut biomedical protocols , and all these sorts of things , to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3D camera systems .
And this was fascinating .
But what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep .
And taking them down so that they had access — astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme environments — taking them down to the vents , and letting them see , and take samples and test instruments , and so on .
So , here we were making documentary films , but actually doing science , and actually doing space science .
I &apos;d completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan , you know , as a kid , and doing this stuff for real .
And you know , along the way in this journey of discovery , I learned a lot .
I learned a lot about science . But I also learned a lot about leadership .
Now you think director has got to be a leader , leader of , captain of the ship , and all that sort of thing .
I didn &apos;t really learn about leadership until I did these expeditions .
Because I had to , at a certain point , say , &quot; &quot; What am I doing out here ?
Why am I doing this ? What do I get out of it ? &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t make money at these damn shows .
We barely break even . There is no fame in it .
People sort of think I went away between &quot; &quot; Titanic &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Avatar &quot; &quot; and was buffing my nails someplace , sitting at the beach .
Made all these films , made all these documentary films for a very limited audience .
No fame , no glory , no money . What are you doing ?
You &apos;re doing it for the task itself , for the challenge — and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is — for the thrill of discovery , and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a tightly knit team .
Because we would do these things with 10 , 12 people , working for years at a time , sometimes at sea for two , three months at a time .
And in that bond , you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you , that you &apos;ve done a task that you can &apos;t explain to someone else .
When you come back to the shore and you say , &quot; &quot; We had to do this , and the fiber optic , and the attentuation , and the this and the that , all the technology of it , and the difficulty , the human-performance aspects of working at sea , &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t explain it to people . It &apos;s that thing that maybe cops have , or people in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it .
Creates a bond , creates a bond of respect .
So , when I came back to make my next movie , which was &quot; &quot; Avatar , &quot; &quot; I tried to apply that same principle of leadership , which is that you respect your team , and you earn their respect in return .
And it really changed the dynamic .
So , here I was again with a small team , in uncharted territory , doing &quot; &quot; Avatar , &quot; &quot; coming up with new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
Tremendously exciting .
Tremendously challenging .
And we became a family , over a four-and-half year period .
And it completely changed how I do movies .
So , people have commented on how , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of Pandora . &quot; &quot; To me , it was more of a fundamental way of doing business , the process itself , that changed as a result of that .
So , what can we synthesize out of all this ?
You know , what are the lessons learned ?
Well , I think number one is curiosity .
It &apos;s the most powerful thing you own .
Imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality .
And the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels in the world .
I have young filmmakers come up to me and say , &quot; &quot; Give me some advice for doing this . &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t put limitations on yourself .
Other people will do that for you — don &apos;t do it to yourself , don &apos;t bet against yourself , and take risks . &quot; &quot; NASA has this phrase that they like : &quot; Failure is not an option . &quot;
But failure has to be an option in art and in exploration , because it &apos;s a leap of faith .
And no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk .
You have to be willing to take those risks .
So , that &apos;s the thought I would leave you with , is that in whatever you &apos;re doing , failure is an option , but fear is not . Thank you .
( Applause )
( Laughter ) Thank you .
I want to make a case .
He created this experiment that is used in many other experiments in behavioral science .
I bring you into a room .
He gathered his participants and said : &quot; I &apos;m going to time you , how quickly you can solve this problem . &quot;
Incentivize them .
It dulls thinking and blocks creativity .
And I &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s not even close .
Rewards , by their very nature , narrow our focus , concentrate the mind ; that &apos;s why they work in so many cases .
Let me tell you why this is so important .
I &apos;m not telling a story , I &apos;m making a case .
Do you know who sponsored this research ?
The good news is that the scientists who &apos;ve been studying motivation have given us this new approach .
Autonomy : the urge to direct our own lives .
Mastery : the desire to get better and better at something that matters .
I want to talk today only about autonomy .
In the 20th century , we came up with this idea of management .
Management did not emanate from nature .
Somebody invented it .
But if you want engagement , self-direction works better .
How many of you have heard of the company Atlassian ?
And they do something incredibly cool .
Autonomy , mastery and purpose , the building blocks of a new way of doing things .
A few years later , another encyclopedia got started .
The drive to do things cause they matter .
And here &apos;s the best part .
We already know this .
For the past decade , I &apos;ve been studying non-state armed groups : armed organizations like terrorists , insurgents or militias .
I document what these groups do when they &apos;re not shooting .
My goal is to better understand these violent actors and to study ways to encourage transition from violent engagement to nonviolent confrontation .
I work in the field , in the policy world and in the library .
Understanding non-state armed groups is key to solving most ongoing conflict , because war has changed .
It used to be a contest between states .
No longer .
It is now a conflict between states and non-state actors .
For example , of the 216 peace agreements signed between 1975 and 2011 , 196 of them were between a state and a non-state actor .
So we need to understand these groups ; we need to either engage them or defeat them in any conflict resolution process that has to be successful .
So how do we do that ?
We need to know what makes these organizations tick .
We know a lot about how they fight , why they fight , but no one looks at what they &apos;re doing when they &apos;re not fighting .
Yet , armed struggle and unarmed politics are related .
It is all part of the same organization .
We cannot understand these groups , let alone defeat them , if we don &apos;t have the full picture .
And armed groups today are complex organizations .
Take the Lebanese Hezbollah , known for its violent confrontation against Israel .
But since its creation in the early 1980s , Hezbollah has also set up a political party , a social-service network , and a military apparatus .
Similarly , the Palestinian Hamas , known for its suicide attacks against Israel , also runs the Gaza Strip since 2007 .
So these groups do way more than just shoot .
They multi-task .
They set up complex communication machines — radio stations , TV channels , Internet websites and social media strategies .
And up here , you have the ISIS magazine , printed in English and published to recruit .
Armed groups also invest in complex fund-raising — not looting , but setting up profitable businesses ; for example , construction companies .
Now , these activities are keys .
They allow these groups to increase their strength , increase their funds , to better recruit and to build their brand .
Armed groups also do something else : they build stronger bonds with the population by investing in social services .
They build schools , they run hospitals , they set up vocational-training programs or micro-loan programs .
Hezbollah offers all of these services and more .
Armed groups also seek to win the population over by offering something that the state is not providing : safety and security .
The initial rise of the Taliban in war-torn Afghanistan , or even the beginning of the ascent of ISIS , can be understood also by looking at these groups &apos; efforts to provide security .
Now , unfortunately , in these cases , the provision of security came at an unbearably high price for the population .
But in general , providing social services fills a gap , a governance gap left by the government , and allows these groups to increase their strength and their power .
For example , the 2006 electoral victory of the Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without acknowledging the group &apos;s social work .
Now , this is a really complex picture , yet in the West , when we look at armed groups , we only think of the violent side .
But that &apos;s not enough to understand these groups &apos; strength , strategy or long-term vision .
These groups are hybrid .
They rise because they fill a gap left by the government , and they emerge to be both armed and political , engage in violent struggle and provide governance .
And the more these organizations are complex and sophisticated , the less we can think of them as the opposite of a state .
Now , what do you call a group like Hezbollah ?
They run part of a territory , they administer all their functions , they pick up the garbage , they run the sewage system .
Is this a state ? Is it a rebel group ?
Or maybe something else , something different and new ?
And what about ISIS ?
The lines are blurred .
We live in a world of states , non-states , and in-between , and the more states are weak , like in the Middle East today , the more non-state actors step in and fill that gap .
This matters for governments , because to counter these groups , they will have to invest more in non-military tools .
Filling that governance gap has to be at the center of any sustainable approach .
This also matters very much for peacemaking and peacebuilding .
If we better understand armed groups , we will better know what incentives to offer to encourage the transition from violence to nonviolence .
So in this new contest between states and non-states , military power can win some battles , but it will not give us peace nor stability .
To achieve these objectives , what we need is a long-term investment in filling that security gap , in filling that governance gap that allowed these groups to thrive in the first place .
Thank you .

My name is Emiliano Salinas and I &apos;m going to talk about the role we members of society play in the violent atmosphere this country is living in right now .
I was born in 1976 .
I grew up in a traditional Mexican family .
As a child , I had a pretty normal life : I would go to school , play with my friends and cousins .
But then my father became President of Mexico and my life changed .
What I &apos;m about to say , at least some of what I &apos;m about to say , will cause controversy .
Firstly , because I &apos;m the one who &apos;s going to say it .
And secondly , because what I &apos;m going to say is true , and it will make a lot of people nervous because it &apos;s something we don &apos;t want to hear .
But it &apos;s imperative that we listen because it &apos;s undeniable and definitive .
It will also make members of criminal organizations nervous for the same reasons .
I &apos;m going to talk about the role we members of society play in this phenomenon , and about four different response levels we citizens have against violence .
I know many will find it difficult to separate the fact that I &apos;m Carlos Salinas de Gortari &apos;s son from the fact that I &apos;m a citizen concerned about the country &apos;s current situation .
Don &apos;t worry .
It &apos;s not necessary for understanding the importance of what I &apos;m going to say .
I think we have a problem in Mexico .
We have a big problem .
I think there &apos;s consensus on this .
No one argues — we all agree there &apos;s a problem .
What we don &apos;t agree on is what the problem actually is .
Is it the Zetas ? The drug traffickers ? The government ?
Corruption ? Poverty ? Or is it something else ?
I think none of these is the problem .
I don &apos;t mean they don &apos;t deserve attention .
But we won &apos;t be able to take care of any of those things if we don &apos;t solve the real problem we have in Mexico first .
The real problem we have is most of us Mexicans , we believe we are victims of our circumstances .
We are a country of victims .
Historically , we &apos;ve always acted as victims of something or somebody .
We were victims of the Spaniards .
Then we were victims of the French .
Then we were victims of Don Porfirio .
Then we were victims of the PRI .
Even of Salinas .
And of El Peje .
And now of the Zetas and the traffickers and the criminals and the kidnappers ...
Hold on ! Wait a minute !
What if none of these things is the problem ?
The problem is not the things we feel victims of .
The problem is that we play the role of victims .
We need to open our eyes and see that we are not victims .
If only we stopped feeling like victims , if we stopped acting as victims , our country would change so much !
I &apos;m going to talk about how to go from a society that acts as a victim of circumstances to a responsible , involved society that takes the future of its country in its own hands .
I &apos;m going to talk about four different levels of civil response against violence , from weakest to strongest .
The first level , the weakest level of civil response against violence , is denial and apathy .
Today , much of Mexican society is in denial of the situation we &apos;re going through .
We want to go on with our daily life even though we are not living under normal circumstances .
Daily life in our country is , to say the least , under extraordinary , exceptional circumstances .
It &apos;s like someone who has a serious illness and pretends it &apos;s the flu and it will just go away .
We want to pretend that Mexico has the flu .
But it doesn &apos;t .
Mexico has cancer .
And if we don &apos;t do something about it , the cancer will end up killing it .
We need to move Mexican society from denial and apathy to the next level of citizen response , which is , effectively , recognition .
And that recognition will sow fear — recognizing the seriousness of the situation .
But , fear is better than apathy because fear makes us do something .
Many people in Mexico are afraid today .
We &apos;re very afraid .
And we &apos;re acting out of that fear .
And let me tell you what the problem is with acting out of fear — and this is the second level of civil response : fear .
Let &apos;s think about Mexican streets : they &apos;re unsafe because of violence , so people stay at home .
Does that make streets more or less safe ?
Less safe !
So streets become more desolate and unsafe , so we stay home more — which makes streets even more desolate and unsafe , and we stay home even more .
This vicious circle ends up with the whole population stuck inside their houses , scared to death — even more afraid than when we were out on the streets .
We need to confront this fear .
We need to move Mexican society , the members of society who are at this level , to the next level , which is action .
We need to face our fears and take back our streets , our cities , our neighborhoods .
For many people , acting involves courage .
We go from fear to courage .
They say , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t take it anymore .
Let &apos;s do something about it . &quot; &quot; Recently — this is a sensitive figure — 35 public lynchings have been recorded so far in 2010 in Mexico .
Usually it &apos;s one or two a year .
Now we &apos;re experiencing one every week .
This shows that society is desperate and it &apos;s taking the law into its own hands .
Unfortunately , violent action — though action is better than no action — but taking part in it only disguises violence .
If I &apos;m violent with you and you respond with violence , you become part of the violence and you just disguise my violence .
So civil action is vital , but it &apos;s also vital to take people who are at the level of courage and violent action to the next level , which is non-violent action .
It &apos;s pacific , coordinated civil action , which doesn &apos;t mean passive action .
It means it &apos;s determined and effective , but not violent .
There are examples of this kind of action in Mexico .
Two years ago , in Galena City , Chihuahua , a member of the community was kidnapped , Eric Le Barón .
His brothers , Benjamín and Julián , got together with the rest of the community to think of the best course of action : to pay the ransom , to take up arms and go after the kidnappers or to ask the government for help .
In the end , Benjamín and Julián decided the best thing they could do was to organize the community and act together .
So what did they do ?
They mobilized the whole community of Le Barón to go to Chihuahua , where they organized a sit-in in the central park of the city .
They sent a message to the kidnappers : &quot; &quot; If you want your ransom come and get it .
We &apos;ll be waiting for you right here . &quot; &quot; They stayed there .
Seven days later , Eric was set free and was able to return home .
This is an example of what an organized society can do , a society that acts .
Of course , criminals can respond .
And in this case , they did .
On July 7th , 2009 , Benjamín Le Barón was murdered .
But Julián Le Barón keeps working and he has been mobilizing communities in Chihuahua for over a year .
And for over a year he has known that a price has been put on his head .
But he keeps fighting .
He keeps organizing .
He keeps mobilizing .
These heroic acts are present all over the country .
With a thousand Juliáns working together , Mexico would be a very different country .
And they &apos;re out there !
They just have to raise their hands .
I was born in Mexico , I grew up in Mexico and along the way , I learned to love Mexico .
I think anyone who has stepped foot on this land — not to mention all Mexican people — will agree that it &apos;s not difficult to love Mexico .
I &apos;ve traveled a lot and nowhere else have I found the passion Mexicans have .
That devotion we feel for the national football team .
That devotion we show in helping victims of disasters , such as the earthquake in 1985 or this year &apos;s floods .
The passion with which we &apos;ve been singing the national anthem since we were kids .
When we thought Masiosare was the strange enemy , and we sang , with a childlike heart , &quot; a soldier in each son . &quot;
I think the biggest insult , the worst way you can offend a Mexican is to insult their mother .
A mother is the most sacred thing in life .
Mexico is our mother and today she cries out for her children .
We are going through the darkest moment in our recent history .
Our mother , Mexico , is being violated before our very eyes .
What are we going to do ?
Masiosare , the strange enemy , is here .
Where is the soldier in each son ?
Mahatma Gandhi , one of the greatest civil fighters of all time , said , &quot; Be the change you wish to see in the world . &quot;
Today in Mexico we &apos;re asking for Gandhis .
We need Gandhis .
We need men and women who love Mexico and who are willing to take action .
This is a call for every true Mexican to join this initiative . This is a call
so that every single thing we love about Mexico — the festivals , the markets , the restaurants , the cantinas , the tequila , the mariachis , the serenades , the posadas , El Grito , the Day of the Dead , San Miguel , the joy , the passion for life , the fight and everything it means to be Mexican — doesn &apos;t disappear from this world .
We &apos;re facing a very powerful opponent .
But we are many more .
They can take a man &apos;s life .
Anyone can kill me , or you , or you .
But no one can kill the spirit of true Mexicans .
The battle is won , but we still have to fight it .
2000 years ago , the Roman poet Juvenal said something that today echoes in the heart of every true Mexican .
He said , &quot; &quot; Count it the greatest sin to prefer life to honor , and for the sake of living to lose what makes life worth living . &quot; &quot; Thank you .

This is actually a painting that hangs at the Countway Library at Harvard Medical School .
And it shows the first time an organ was ever transplanted .
In the front , you see , actually , Joe Murray getting the patient ready for the transplant , while in the back room you see Hartwell Harrison , the Chief of Urology at Harvard , actually harvesting the kidney .
The kidney was indeed the first organ ever to be transplanted to the human .
That was back in 1954 , 55 years ago .
Yet we &apos;re still dealing with a lot of the same challenges as many decades ago .
Certainly many advances , many lives saved .
But we have a major shortage of organs .
In the last decade the number of patients waiting for a transplant has doubled .
While , at the same time , the actual number of transplants has remained almost entirely flat .
That really has to do with our aging population .
We &apos;re just getting older .
Medicine is doing a better job of keeping us alive .
But as we age , our organs tend to fail more .
So , that &apos;s a challenge , not just for organs but also for tissues .
Trying to replace pancreas , trying to replace nerves that can help us with Parkinson &apos;s .
These are major issues .
This is actually a very stunning statistic .
Every 30 seconds a patient dies from diseases that could be treated with tissue regeneration or replacement .
So , what can we do about it ?
We &apos;ve talked about stem cells tonight .
That &apos;s a way to do it .
But still ways to go to get stem cells into patients , in terms of actual therapies for organs .
Wouldn &apos;t it be great if our bodies could regenerate ?
Wouldn &apos;t it be great if we could actually harness the power of our bodies , to actually heal ourselves ?
It &apos;s not really that foreign of a concept , actually ; it happens on the Earth every day .
This is actually a picture of a salamander .
Salamanders have this amazing capacity to regenerate .
You see here a little video .
This is actually a limb injury in this salamander .
And this is actually real photography , timed photography , showing how that limb regenerates in a period of days .
You see the scar form .
And that scar actually grows out a new limb .
So , salamanders can do it .
Why can &apos;t we ? Why can &apos;t humans regenerate ?
Actually , we can regenerate .
Your body has many organs and every single organ in your body has a cell population that &apos;s ready to take over at the time of injury . It happens every day .
As you age , as you get older .
Your bones regenerate every 10 years .
Your skin regenerates every two weeks .
So , your body is constantly regenerating .
The challenge occurs when there is an injury .
At the time of injury or disease , the body &apos;s first reaction is to seal itself off from the rest of the body .
It basically wants to fight off infection , and seal itself , whether it &apos;s organs inside your body , or your skin , the first reaction is for scar tissue to move in , to seal itself off from the outside .
So , how can we harness that power ?
One of the ways that we do that is actually by using smart biomaterials .
How does this work ? Well , on the left side here you see a urethra which was injured .
This is the channel that connects the bladder to the outside of the body .
And you see that it is injured .
We basically found out that you can use these smart biomaterials that you can actually use as a bridge .
If you build that bridge , and you close off from the outside environment , then you can create that bridge , and cells that regenerate in your body , can then cross that bridge , and take that path .
That &apos;s exactly what you see here .
It &apos;s actually a smart biomaterial that we used , to actually treat this patient .
This was an injured urethra on the left side .
We used that biomaterial in the middle .
And then , six months later on the right-hand side you see this reengineered urethra .
Turns out your body can regenerate , but only for small distances .
The maximum efficient distance for regeneration is only about one centimeter .
So , we can use these smart biomaterials but only for about one centimeter to bridge those gaps .
So , we do regenerate , but for limited distances .
What do we do now , if you have injury for larger organs ?
What do we do when we have injuries for structures which are much larger than one centimeter ?
Then we can start to use cells .
The strategy here , is if a patient comes in to us with a diseased or injured organ , you can take a very small piece of tissue from that organ , less than half the size of a postage stamp , you can then tease that tissue apart , and look at its basic components , the patient &apos;s own cells , you take those cells out , grow and expand those cells outside the body in large quantities , and then we then use scaffold materials .
To the naked eye they look like a piece of your blouse , or your shirt , but actually these materials are fairly complex and they are designed to degrade once inside the body .
It disintegrates a few months later .
It &apos;s acting only as a cell delivery vehicle .
It &apos;s bringing the cells into the body . It &apos;s allowing the cells to regenerate new tissue , and once the tissue is regenerated the scaffold goes away .
And that &apos;s what we did for this piece of muscle .
This is actually showing a piece of muscle and how we go through the structures to actually engineer the muscle .
We take the cells , we expand them , we place the cells on the scaffold , and we then place the scaffold back into the patient .
But actually , before placing the scaffold into the patient , we actually exercise it .
We want to make sure that we condition this muscle , so that it knows what to do once we put it into the patient .
That &apos;s what you &apos;re seeing here . You &apos;re seeing this muscle bio-reactor actually exercising the muscle back and forth .
Okay . These are flat structures that we see here , the muscle .
What about other structures ?
This is actually an engineered blood vessel .
Very similar to what we just did , but a little bit more complex .
Here we take a scaffold , and we basically — scaffold can be like a piece of paper here .
And we can then tubularize this scaffold .
And what we do is we , to make a blood vessel , same strategy .
A blood vessel is made up of two different cell types .
We take muscle cells , we paste , or coat the outside with these muscle cells , very much like baking a layer cake , if you will .
You place the muscle cells on the outside .
You place the vascular blood vessel lining cells on the inside .
You now have your fully seeded scaffold .
You &apos;re going to place this in an oven-like device .
It has the same conditions as a human body , 37 degrees centigrade , 95 percent oxygen .
You then exercise it , as what you saw on that tape .
And on the right you actually see a carotid artery that was engineered .
This is actually the artery that goes from your neck to your brain .
And this is an X-ray showing you the patent , functional blood vessel .
More complex structures such as blood vessels , urethras , which I showed you , they &apos;re definitely more complex because you &apos;re introducing two different cell types .
But they are really acting mostly as conduits .
You &apos;re allowing fluid or air to go through at steady states .
They are not nearly as complex as hollow organs .
Hollow organs have a much higher degree of complexity , because you &apos;re asking these organs to act on demand .
So , the bladder is one such organ .
Same strategy , we take a very small piece of the bladder , less than half the size of a postage stamp .
We then tease the tissue apart into its two individual cell components , muscle , and these bladder specialized cells .
We grow the cells outside the body in large quantities .
It takes about four weeks to grow these cells from the organ .
We then take a scaffold that we shape like a bladder .
We coat the inside with these bladder lining cells .
We coat the outside with these muscle cells .
We place it back into this oven-like device .
From the time you take that piece of tissue , six to eight weeks later you can put the organ right back into the patient .
This actually shows the scaffold .
The material is actually being coated with the cells .
When we did the first clinical trial for these patients we actually created the scaffold specifically for each patient .
We brought patients in , six to eight weeks prior to their scheduled surgery , did X-rays , and we then composed a scaffold specifically for that patient &apos;s size pelvic cavity .
For the second phase of the trials we just had different sizes , small , medium , large and extra-large .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s true .
And I &apos;m sure everyone here wanted an extra-large . Right ?
( Laughter ) So , bladders are definitely a little bit more complex than the other structures .
But there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it .
This is actually a heart valve , which we engineered .
And the way you engineer this heart valve is the same strategy .
We take the scaffold , we seed it with cells , and you can now see here , the valve leaflets opening and closing .
We exercise these prior to implantation .
Same strategy .
And then the most complex are the solid organs .
For solid organs , they &apos;re more complex because you &apos;re using a lot more cells per centimeter .
This is actually a simple solid organ like the ear .
It &apos;s now being seeded with cartilage .
That &apos;s the oven-like device ; once it &apos;s coated it gets placed there .
And then a few weeks later we can take out the cartilage scaffold .
This is actually digits that we &apos;re engineering .
These are being layered , one layer at a time , first the bone , we fill in the gaps with cartilage .
We then start adding the muscle on top .
And you start layering these solid structures .
Again , fairly more complex organs , but by far , the most complex solid organs are actually the vascularized , highly vascularized , a lot of blood vessel supply , organs such as the heart , the liver , the kidneys .
This is actually an example — several strategies to engineer solid organs .
This is actually one of the strategies . We use a printer .
And instead of using ink , we use — you just saw an inkjet cartridge — we just use cells .
This is actually your typical desktop printer .
It &apos;s actually printing this two chamber heart , one layer at a time .
You see the heart coming out there . It takes about 40 minutes to print , and about four to six hours later you see the muscle cells contract .
( Applause ) This technology was developed by Tao Ju , who worked at our institute .
And this is actually still , of course , experimental , not for use in patients .
Another strategy that we have followed is actually to use decellularized organs .
We actually take donor organs , organs that are discarded , and we then can use very mild detergents to take all the cell elements out of these organs .
So , for example on the left panel , top panel , you see a liver .
We actually take the donor liver , we use very mild detergents , and we , by using these mild detergents , we take all the cells out of the liver .
Two weeks later , we basically can lift this organ up , it feels like a liver , we can hold it like a liver , it looks like a liver , but it has no cells .
All we are left with is the skeleton , if you will , of the liver , all made up of collagen , a material that &apos;s in our bodies , that will not reject .
We can use it from one patient to the next .
We then take this vascular structure and we can prove that we retain the blood vessel supply .
You can see , actually that &apos;s a fluoroscopy .
We &apos;re actually injecting contrast into the organ .
Now you can see it start . We &apos;re injecting the contrast into the organ into this decellularized liver .
And you can see the vascular tree that remains intact .
We then take the cells , the vascular cells , blood vessel cells , we perfuse the vascular tree with the patient &apos;s own cells .
We perfuse the outside of the liver with the patient &apos;s own liver cells .
And we can then create functional livers .
And that &apos;s actually what you &apos;re seeing .
This is still experimental . But we are able to actually reproduce the functionality of the liver structure , experimentally .
For the kidney , as I talked to you about the first painting that you saw , the first slide I showed you , 90 percent of the patients on the transplant wait list are waiting for a kidney , 90 percent .
So , another strategy we &apos;re following is actually to create wafers that we stack together , like an accordion , if you will .
So , we stack these wafers together , using the kidney cells .
And then you can see these miniature kidneys that we &apos;ve engineered .
They are actually making urine .
Again , small structures , our challenge is how to make them larger , and that is something we &apos;re working on right now at the institute .
One of the things that I wanted to summarize for you then is what is a strategy that we &apos;re going for in regenerative medicine .
If at all possible , we really would like to use smart biomaterials that we can just take off the shelf and regenerate your organs .
We are limited with distances right now , but our goal is actually to increase those distances over time .
If we cannot use smart biomaterials , then we &apos;d rather use your very own cells .
Why ? Because they will not reject .
We can take cells from you , create the structure , put it right back into you , they will not reject .
And if possible , we &apos;d rather use the cells from your very specific organ .
If you present with a diseased wind pipe we &apos;d like to take cells from your windpipe .
If you present with a diseased pancreas we &apos;d like to take cells from that organ .
Why ? Because we &apos;d rather take those cells which already know that those are the cell types you want .
A windpipe cell already knows it &apos;s a windpipe cell .
We don &apos;t need to teach it to become another cell type .
So , we prefer organ-specific cells .
And today we can obtain cells from most every organ in your body , except for several which we still need stem cells for , like heart , liver , nerve and pancreas .
And for those we still need stem cells .
If we cannot use stem cells from your body then we &apos;d like to use donor stem cells .
And we prefer cells that will not reject and will not form tumors .
And we &apos;re working a lot with the stem cells that we published on two years ago , stem cells from the amniotic fluid , and the placenta , which have those properties .
So , at this point , I do want to tell you that some of the major challenges we have .
You know , I just showed you this presentation , everything looks so good , everything works . Actually no , these technologies really are not that easy .
Some of the work you saw today was performed by over 700 researchers at our institute across a 20-year time span .
So , these are very tough technologies .
Once you get the formula right you can replicate it .
But it takes a lot to get there .
So , I always like to show this cartoon .
This is how to stop a runaway stage .
And there you see the stagecoach driver , and he goes , on the top panel , He goes A , B , C , D , E , F.
He finally stops the runaway stage .
And those are usually the basic scientists , The bottom is usually the surgeons .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m a surgeon so that &apos;s not that funny . ( Laughter )
But actually method A is the correct approach .
And what I mean by that is that anytime we &apos;ve launched one of these technologies to the clinic , we &apos;ve made absolutely sure that we do everything we can in the laboratory before we ever launch these technologies to patients .
And when we launch these technologies to patients we want to make sure that we ask ourselves a very tough question .
Are you ready to place this in your own loved one , your own child , your own family member , and then we proceed .
Because our main goal , of course , is first , to do no harm .
I &apos;m going to show you now , a very short clip , It &apos;s a five second clip of a patient who received one of the engineered organs .
We started implanting some of these structures over 14 years ago .
So , we have patients now walking around with organs , engineered organs , for over 10 years , as well .
I &apos;m going to show a clip of one young lady .
She had a spina bifida defect , a spinal cord abnormality .
She did not have a normal bladder . This is a segment from CNN .
We are just taking five seconds .
This is a segment that Sanjay Gupta actually took care of .
Video : Kaitlyn M : I &apos;m happy . I was always afraid that I was going to have like , an accident or something .
And now I can just go and go out with my friends , go do whatever I want .
Anthony Atala : See , at the end of the day , the promise of regenerative medicine is a single promise .
And that is really very simple , to make our patients better .
Thank you for your attention .

Ladies and gentlemen , gather around .
I would love to share with you a story .
Once upon a time in 19th century Germany , there was the book .
Now during this time , the book was the king of storytelling .
It was venerable .
It was ubiquitous .
But it was a little bit boring .
Because in its 400 years of existence , storytellers never evolved the book as a storytelling device .
But then one author arrived , and he changed the game forever .
( Music ) His name was Lothar , Lothar Meggendorfer .
Lothar Meggendorfer put his foot down , and he said , &quot; &quot; Genug ist genug ! &quot; &quot; He grabbed his pen , he snatched his scissors .
This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold .
History would know Lothar Meggendorfer as — who else ? — the world &apos;s first true inventor of the children &apos;s pop-up book .
( Music ) For this delight and for this wonder , people rejoiced .
( Cheering ) They were happy because the story survived , and that the world would keep on spinning .
Lothar Meggendorfer wasn &apos;t the first to evolve the way a story was told , and he certainly wasn &apos;t the last .
Whether storytellers realized it or not , they were channeling Meggendorfer &apos;s spirit when they moved opera to vaudville , radio news to radio theater , film to film in motion to film in sound , color , 3D , on VHS and on DVD .
There seemed to be no cure for this Meggendorferitis .
And things got a lot more fun when the Internet came around .
( Laughter ) Because , not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world , but they could do so using what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices .
For example , one company would tell a story of love through its very own search engine .
One Taiwanese production studio would interpret American politics in 3D .
( Laughter ) And one man would tell the stories of his father by using a platform called Twitter to communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate .
And after all this , everyone paused ; they took a step back .
They realized that , in 6,000 years of storytelling , they &apos;ve gone from depicting hunting on cave walls to depicting Shakespeare on Facebook walls .
And this was a cause for celebration .
The art of storytelling has remained unchanged .
And for the most part , the stories are recycled .
But the way that humans tell the stories has always evolved with pure , consistent novelty .
And they remembered a man , one amazing German , every time a new storytelling device popped up next .
And for that , the audience — the lovely , beautiful audience — would live happily ever after .

Some 17 years ago , I became allergic to Delhi &apos;s air .
My doctors told me that my lung capacity had gone down to 70 percent , and it was killing me .
With the help of IIT , TERI , and learnings from NASA , we discovered that there are three basic green plants , common green plants , with which we can grow all the fresh air we need indoors to keep us healthy .
We &apos;ve also found that you can reduce the fresh air requirements into the building , while maintaining industry indoor air-quality standards .
The three plants are Areca palm , Mother-in-Law &apos;s Tongue and money plant .
The botanical names are in front of you .
Areca palm is a plant which removes CO2 and converts it into oxygen .
We need four shoulder-high plants per person , and in terms of plant care , we need to wipe the leaves every day in Delhi , and perhaps once a week in cleaner-air cities .
We had to grow them in vermi manure , which is sterile , or hydroponics , and take them outdoors every three to four months .
The second plant is Mother-in-law &apos;s Tongue , which is again a very common plant , and we call it a bedroom plant , because it converts CO2 into oxygen at night .
And we need six to eight waist-high plants per person .
The third plant is money plant , and this is again a very common plant ; preferably grows in hydroponics .
And this particular plant removes formaldehydes and other volatile chemicals .
With these three plants , you can grow all the fresh air you need .
In fact , you could be in a bottle with a cap on top , and you would not die at all , and you would not need any fresh air .
We have tried these plants at our own building in Delhi , which is a 50,000-square-feet , 20-year-old building .
And it has close to 1,200 such plants for 300 occupants .
Our studies have found that there is a 42 percent probability of one &apos;s blood oxygen going up by one percent if one stays indoors in this building for 10 hours .
The government of India has discovered or published a study to show that this is the healthiest building in New Delhi .
And the study showed that , compared to other buildings , there is a reduced incidence of eye irritation by 52 percent , respiratory systems by 34 percent , headaches by 24 percent , lung impairment by 12 percent and asthma by nine percent .
And this study has been published on September 8 , 2008 , and it &apos;s available on the government of India website .
Our experience points to an amazing increase in human productivity by over 20 percent by using these plants .
And also a reduction in energy requirements in buildings by an outstanding 15 percent , because you need less fresh air .
We are now replicating this in a 1.75-million-square-feet building , which will have 60,000 indoor plants .
Why is this important ?
It is also important for the environment , because the world &apos;s energy requirements are expected to grow by 30 percent in the next decade .
40 percent of the world &apos;s energy is taken up by buildings currently , and 60 percent of the world &apos;s population will be living in buildings in cities with a population of over one million in the next 15 years .
And there is a growing preference for living and working in air-conditioned places .
&quot; Be the change you want to see in the world , &quot; said Mahatma Gandhi .
And thank you for listening .

I &apos;m a storyteller .
There weren &apos;t many of them available , and they weren &apos;t quite as easy to find as the foreign books .
They stirred my imagination . They opened up new worlds for me .
I come from a conventional , middle-class Nigerian family .
My father was a professor .
My mother sent yams and rice , and our old clothes , to his family .
So I felt enormous pity for Fide &apos;s family .
I was startled .
It had not occurred to me that anybody in his family could actually make something .
All I had heard about them was how poor they were , so that it had become impossible for me to see them as anything else but poor .
( Laughter ) She assumed that I did not know how to use a stove .
But in the U.S. , whenever Africa came up , people turned to me .
Never mind that I knew nothing about places like Namibia .
This single story of Africa ultimately comes , I think , from Western literature .
Now , here is a quote from the writing of a London merchant called John Lok , who sailed to west Africa in 1561 and kept a fascinating account of his voyage .
In fact , I did not know what African authenticity was .
Therefore they were not authentically African .
But I must quickly add that I too am just as guilty in the question of the single story .
A few years ago , I visited Mexico from the U.S.
And , as often happens in America , immigration became synonymous with Mexicans .
And then , I was overwhelmed with shame .
I told him that I had just read a novel called &quot; &quot; American Psycho &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — and that it was such a shame that young Americans were serial murderers . ( Laughter )
( Applause ) Now , obviously I said this in a fit of mild irritation . ( Laughter )
This is not because I am a better person than that student , but because of America &apos;s cultural and economic power , I had many stories of America .
I had read Tyler and Updike and Steinbeck and Gaitskill .
I did not have a single story of America .
But I also had grandfathers who died in refugee camps .
One of my closest friends , Okoloma , died in a plane crash because our fire trucks did not have water .
I grew up under repressive military governments that devalued education , so that sometimes , my parents were not paid their salaries .
I &apos;ve always felt that it is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person .
It emphasizes how we are different rather than how we are similar .
What if my mother had told us that Fide &apos;s family was poor and hardworking ?
Here was a woman , part of the ordinary masses of Nigerians , who were not supposed to be readers .
What if my roommate knew about contemporary Nigerian music , talented people singing in English and Pidgin , and Igbo and Yoruba and Ijo , mixing influences from Jay-Z to Fela to Bob Marley to their grandfathers .
Or about the millions of other Nigerians who start businesses and sometimes fail , but continue to nurse ambition ?
Many stories matter .
Stories have been used to dispossess and to malign , but stories can also be used to empower and to humanize .
She introduced them to a book about the Southern life that they had left behind .
Chris Anderson : William , hi . Good to see you .
William Kamkwamba : Thanks .
CA : So , we &apos;ve got a picture , I think ? Where is this ?
WK : This is my home . This is where I live .
CA : Where ? What country ?
WK : In Malawi , Kasungu . In Kasungu . Yeah , Mala .
CA : OK . Now , you &apos;re 19 now ?
WK : Yeah . I &apos;m 19 years now .
CA : Five years ago you had an idea . What was that ?
WK : I wanted to make a windmill .
CA : A windmill ?
WK : Yeah .
CA : What , to power — for lighting and stuff ?
WK : Yeah .
CA : So what did you do ? How did you realize that ?
WK : After I dropped out of school , I went to library , and I read a book that would — &quot; &quot; Using Energy , &quot; &quot; and I get information about doing the mill .
And I tried , and I made it .
( Applause ) CA : So you copied — you exactly copied the design in the book .
WK : Ah , no . I just — CA : What happened ?
WK : In fact , a design of the windmill that was in the book , it has got four — ah — three blades , and mine has got four blades .
CA : The book had three , yours had four .
WK : Yeah .
CA : And you made it out of what ?
WK : I made four blades , just because I want to increase power .
CA : OK .
WK : Yeah .
CA : You tested three , and found that four worked better ?
WK : Yeah . I test .
CA : And what did you make the windmill out of ?
What materials did you use ?
WK : I use a bicycle frame , and a pulley , and plastic pipe , what then pulls — CA : Do we have a picture of that ? Can we have the next slide ?
WK : Yeah . The windmill .
CA : And so , and that windmill , what — it worked ?
WK : When the wind blows , it rotates and generates .
CA : How much electricity ?
WK : 12 watts .
CA : And so , that lit a light for the house ? How many lights ?
WK : Four bulbs and two radios .
CA : Wow .
WK : Yeah .
( Applause ) CA : Next slide — so who &apos;s that ?
WK : This is my parents , holding the radio .
CA : So what did they make of — that you were 14 , 15 at the time — what did they make of this ? They were impressed ?
WK : Yeah .
CA : And so what &apos;s your — what are you going to do with this ?
WK : Um — CA : What do you — I mean — do you want to build another one ?
WK : Yeah , I want to build another one — to pump water and irrigation for crops .
CA : So this one would have to be bigger ?
WK : Yeah .
CA : How big ?
WK : I think it will produce more than 20 the watts .
CA : So that would produce irrigation for the entire village ?
WK : Yeah .
CA : Wow . And so you &apos;re talking to people here at TED to get people who might be able to help in some way to realize this dream ?
WK : Yeah , if they can help me with materials , yeah .
CA : And as you think of your life going forward , you &apos;re 19 now , do you picture continuing with this dream of working in energy ?
WK : Yeah . I &apos;m still thinking to work on energy .
CA : Wow . William , it &apos;s a real honor to have you at the TED conference .
Thank you so much for coming .
WK : Thank you .

YouTube , they &apos;re putting this thing on YouTube .
Why did you bring this up ?
( Applause )
Why does the universe exist ?
Why is there — Okay . Okay . ( Laughter ) This is a cosmic mystery . Be solemn .
Why is there a world , why are we in it , and why is there something rather than nothing at all ?
I mean , this is the super ultimate &quot; &quot; why &quot; &quot; question ?
So I &apos;m going to talk about the mystery of existence , the puzzle of existence , where we are now in addressing it , and why you should care , and I hope you do care .
The philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer said that those who don &apos;t wonder about the contingency of their existence , of the contingency of the world &apos;s existence , are mentally deficient .
That &apos;s a little harsh , but still . ( Laughter ) So this has been called the most sublime and awesome mystery , the deepest and most far-reaching question man can pose .
It &apos;s obsessed great thinkers .
Ludwig Wittgenstein , perhaps the greatest philosopher of the 20th century , was astonished that there should be a world at all .
John Archibald Wheeler , one of the great physicists of the 20th century , the teacher of Richard Feynman , the coiner of the term &quot; &quot; black hole , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I want to know how come the quantum , how come the universe , how come existence ? &quot; &quot; And my friend Martin Amis — sorry that I &apos;ll be doing a lot of name-dropping in this talk , so get used to it — my dear friend Martin Amis once said that we &apos;re about five Einsteins away from answering the mystery of where the universe came from .
And I &apos;ve no doubt there are five Einsteins in the audience tonight .
Any Einsteins ? Show of hands ? No ? No ? No ?
No Einsteins ? Okay .
So this question , why is there something rather than nothing , this sublime question , was posed rather late in intellectual history .
It was towards the end of the 17th century , the philosopher Leibniz who asked it , a very smart guy , Leibniz , who invented the calculus independently of Isaac Newton , at about the same time , but for Leibniz , who asked why is there something rather than nothing , this was not a great mystery .
He either was or pretended to be an Orthodox Christian in his metaphysical outlook , and he said it &apos;s obvious why the world exists : because God created it .
And God created , indeed , out of nothing at all .
That &apos;s how powerful God is .
He doesn &apos;t need any preexisting materials to fashion a world out of .
He can make it out of sheer nothingness , creation ex nihilo .
And by the way , this is what most Americans today believe .
There is no mystery of existence for them .
God made it .
So let &apos;s put this in an equation .
I don &apos;t have any slides so I &apos;m going to mime my visuals , so use your imaginations .
So it &apos;s God + nothing = the world .
Okay ? Now that &apos;s the equation .
And so maybe you don &apos;t believe in God .
Maybe you &apos;re a scientific atheist or an unscientific atheist , and you don &apos;t believe in God , and you &apos;re not happy with it .
By the way , even if we have this equation , God + nothing = the world , there &apos;s already a problem : Why does God exist ?
God doesn &apos;t exist by logic alone unless you believe the ontological argument , and I hope you don &apos;t , because it &apos;s not a good argument .
So it &apos;s conceivable , if God were to exist , he might wonder , I &apos;m eternal , I &apos;m all-powerful , but where did I come from ?
( Laughter ) Whence then am I ?
God speaks in a more formal English .
( Laughter ) And so one theory is that God was so bored with pondering the puzzle of His own existence that He created the world just to distract himself .
But anyway , let &apos;s forget about God .
Take God out of the equation : We have _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ + nothing = the world .
Now , if you &apos;re a Buddhist , you might want to stop right there , because essentially what you &apos;ve got is nothing = the world , and by symmetry of identity , that means the world = nothing . Okay ?
And to a Buddhist , the world is just a whole lot of nothing .
It &apos;s just a big cosmic vacuity .
And we think there &apos;s a lot of something out there but that &apos;s because we &apos;re enslaved by our desires .
If we let our desires melt away , we &apos;ll see the world for what it truly is , a vacuity , nothingness , and we &apos;ll slip into this happy state of nirvana which has been defined as having just enough life to enjoy being dead . ( Laughter ) So that &apos;s the Buddhist thinking .
But I &apos;m a Westerner , and I &apos;m still concerned with the puzzle of existence , so I &apos;ve got _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ + — this is going to get serious in a minute , so — _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ + nothing = the world .
What are we going to put in that blank ?
Well , how about science ?
Science is our best guide to the nature of reality , and the most fundamental science is physics .
That tells us what naked reality really is , that reveals what I call TAUFOTU , the True And Ultimate Furniture Of The Universe .
So maybe physics can fill this blank , and indeed , since about the late 1960s or around 1970 , physicists have purported to give a purely scientific explanation of how a universe like ours could have popped into existence out of sheer nothingness , a quantum fluctuation out of the void .
Stephen Hawking is one of these physicists , more recently Alex Vilenkin , and the whole thing has been popularized by another very fine physicist and friend of mine , Lawrence Krauss , who wrote a book called &quot; A Universe from Nothing , &quot; and Lawrence thinks that he &apos;s given — he &apos;s a militant atheist , by the way , so he &apos;s gotten God out of the picture .
The laws of quantum field theory , the state-of-the-art physics , can show how out of sheer nothingness , no space , no time , no matter , nothing , a little nugget of false vacuum can fluctuate into existence , and then , by the miracle of inflation , blow up into this huge and variegated cosmos we see around us .
Okay , this is a really ingenious scenario .
It &apos;s very speculative . It &apos;s fascinating .
But I &apos;ve got a big problem with it , and the problem is this : It &apos;s a pseudo-religious point of view .
Now , Lawrence thinks he &apos;s an atheist , but he &apos;s still in thrall to a religious worldview .
He sees physical laws as being like divine commands .
The laws of quantum field theory for him are like fiat lux , &quot; &quot; Let there be light . &quot; &quot; The laws have some sort of ontological power or clout that they can form the abyss , that it &apos;s pregnant with being .
They can call a world into existence out of nothing .
But that &apos;s a very primitive view of what a physical law is , right ?
We know that physical laws are actually generalized descriptions of patterns and regularities in the world .
They don &apos;t exist outside the world .
They don &apos;t have any ontic cloud of their own .
They can &apos;t call a world into existence out of nothingness .
That &apos;s a very primitive view of what a scientific law is .
He said , this model is just equations .
What breathes fire into the equations and creates a world for them to describe ?
He was puzzled by this , so equations themselves can &apos;t do the magic , can &apos;t resolve the puzzle of existence .
And besides , even if the laws could do that , why this set of laws ?
Why quantum field theory that describes a universe with a certain number of forces and particles and so forth ?
Why not a completely different set of laws ?
There are many , many mathematically consistent sets of laws .
Why not no laws at all ? Why not sheer nothingness ?
So this is a problem , believe it or not , that reflective physicists really think a lot about , and at this point they tend to go metaphysical , say , well , maybe the set of laws that describes our universe , it &apos;s just one set of laws and it describes one part of reality , but maybe every consistent set of laws describes another part of reality , and in fact all possible physical worlds really exist , they &apos;re all out there .
We just see a little tiny part of reality that &apos;s described by the laws of quantum field theory , but there are many , many other worlds , parts of reality that are described by vastly different theories that are different from ours in ways we can &apos;t imagine , that are inconceivably exotic .
Steven Weinberg , the father of the standard model of particle physics , has actually flirted with this idea himself , that all possible realities actually exist .
Also , a younger physicist , Max Tegmark , who believes that all mathematical structures exist , and mathematical existence is the same thing as physical existence , so we have this vastly rich multiverse that encompasses every logical possibility .
Now , in taking this metaphysical way out , these physicists and also philosophers are actually reaching back to a very old idea that goes back to Plato .
It &apos;s the principle of plenitude or fecundity , or the great chain of being , that reality is actually as full as possible .
It &apos;s as far removed from nothingness as it could possibly be .
So we have these two extremes now .
We have sheer nothingness on one side , and we have this vision of a reality that encompasses every conceivable world at the other extreme : the fullest possible reality , nothingness , the simplest possible reality .
Now what &apos;s in between these two extremes ?
There are all kinds of intermediate realities that include some things and leave out others .
So one of these intermediate realities is , say , the most mathematically elegant reality , that leaves out the inelegant bits , the ugly asymmetries and so forth .
Now , there are some physicists who will tell you that we &apos;re actually living in the most elegant reality .
I think that Brian Greene is in the audience , and he has written a book called &quot; &quot; The Elegant Universe . &quot; &quot; He claims that the universe we live in mathematically is very elegant .
Don &apos;t believe him . ( Laughter ) It &apos;s a pious hope , I wish it were true , but I think the other day he admitted to me it &apos;s really an ugly universe .
It &apos;s stupidly constructed , it &apos;s got way too many arbitrary coupling constants and mass ratios and superfluous families of elementary particles , and what the hell is dark energy ?
It &apos;s a stick and bubble gum contraption .
It &apos;s not an elegant universe . ( Laughter ) And then there &apos;s the best of all possible worlds in an ethical sense .
You should get solemn now , because a world in which sentient beings don &apos;t suffer needlessly , in which there aren &apos;t things like childhood cancer or the Holocaust .
This is an ethical conception .
Anyway , so between nothingness and the fullest possible reality , various special realities .
Nothingness is special . It &apos;s the simplest .
Then there &apos;s the most elegant possible reality .
That &apos;s special .
The fullest possible reality , that &apos;s special .
But what are we leaving out here ?
There &apos;s also just the crummy , generic realities that aren &apos;t special in any way , that are sort of random .
They &apos;re infinitely removed from nothingness , but they fall infinitely short of complete fullness .
They &apos;re a mixture of chaos and order , of mathematical elegance and ugliness .
So I would describe these realities as an infinite , mediocre , incomplete mess , a generic reality , a kind of cosmic junk shot .
And these realities , is there a deity in any of these realities ?
Maybe , but the deity isn &apos;t perfect like the Judeo-Christian deity .
The deity isn &apos;t all-good and all-powerful .
It might be instead 100 percent malevolent but only 80 percent effective , which pretty much describes the world we see around us , I think . ( Laughter ) So I would like to propose that the resolution to the mystery of existence is that the reality we exist in is one of these generic realities .
Reality has to turn out some way .
It can either turn out to be nothing or everything or something in between .
So if it has some special feature , like being really elegant or really full or really simple , like nothingness , that would require an explanation .
But if it &apos;s just one of these random , generic realities , there &apos;s no further explanation for it .
And indeed , I would say that &apos;s the reality we live in .
That &apos;s what science is telling us .
At the beginning of the week , we got the exciting information that the theory of inflation , which predicts a big , infinite , messy , arbitrary , pointless reality , it &apos;s like a big frothing champagne coming out of a bottle endlessly , a vast universe , mostly a wasteland with little pockets of charm and order and peace , this has been confirmed , this inflationary scenario , by the observations made by radio telescopes in Antarctica that looked at the signature of the gravitational waves from just before the Big Bang .
I &apos;m sure you all know about this .
So anyway , I think there &apos;s some evidence that this really is the reality that we &apos;re stuck with .
Now , why should you care ?
Well — ( Laughter ) — the question , &quot; &quot; Why does the world exist ? &quot; &quot; that &apos;s the cosmic question , it sort of rhymes with a more intimate question : Why do I exist ? Why do you exist ?
you know , our existence would seem to be amazingly improbable , because there &apos;s an enormous number of genetically possible humans , if you can compute it by looking at the number of the genes and the number of alleles and so forth , and a back-of-the-envelope calculation will tell you there are about 10 to the 10,000th possible humans , genetically .
That &apos;s between a googol and a googolplex .
And the number of the actual humans that have existed is 100 billion , maybe 50 billion , an infinitesimal fraction , so all of us , we &apos;ve won this amazing cosmic lottery .
We &apos;re here . Okay .
So what kind of reality do we want to live in ?
Do we want to live in a special reality ?
What if we were living in the most elegant possible reality ?
Imagine the existential pressure on us to live up to that , to be elegant , not to pull down the tone of it .
Or , what if we were living in the fullest possible reality ?
Well then our existence would be guaranteed , because every possible thing exists in that reality , but our choices would be meaningless .
If I really struggle morally and agonize and I decide to do the right thing , what difference does it make , because there are an infinite number of versions of me also doing the right thing and an infinite number doing the wrong thing .
So my choices are meaningless .
So we don &apos;t want to live in that special reality .
And as for the special reality of nothingness , we wouldn &apos;t be having this conversation .
So I think living in a generic reality that &apos;s mediocre , there are nasty bits and nice bits and we could make the nice bits bigger and the nasty bits smaller and that gives us a kind of purpose in life .
The universe is absurd , but we can still construct a purpose , and that &apos;s a pretty good one , and the overall mediocrity of reality kind of resonates nicely with the mediocrity we all feel in the core of our being .
And I know you feel it .
I know you &apos;re all special , but you &apos;re still kind of secretly mediocre , don &apos;t you think ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So anyway , you may say , this puzzle , the mystery of existence , it &apos;s just silly mystery-mongering .
You &apos;re not astonished at the existence of the universe and you &apos;re in good company .
Bertrand Russell said , &quot; I should say the universe is just there , and that &apos;s all . &quot;
Just a brute fact .
And my professor at Columbia , Sidney Morgenbesser , a great philosophical wag , when I said to him , &quot; &quot; Professor Morgenbesser , why is there something rather than nothing ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh , even if there was nothing , you still wouldn &apos;t be satisfied . &quot; &quot; So — ( Laughter ) — okay .
So you &apos;re not astonished . I don &apos;t care .
But I will tell you something to conclude that I guarantee you will astonish you , because it &apos;s astonished all of the brilliant , wonderful people I &apos;ve met at this TED conference , when I &apos;ve told them , and it &apos;s this : Never in my life have I had a cell phone .
Thank you .
( Laughter ) ( Applause )
The future , as we know it , is very unpredictable .
The best minds in the best institutions generally get it wrong .
This is in technology . This is in the area of politics , where pundits , the CIA , MI6 always get it wrong .
And it &apos;s clearly in the area of finance .
With institutions established to think about the future , the IMF , the BIS , the Financial Stability Forum , couldn &apos;t see what was coming .
Over 20,000 economists whose job it is , competitive entry to get there , couldn &apos;t see what was happening .
Globalization is getting more complex .
And this change is getting more rapid .
The future will be more unpredictable .
Urbanization , integration , coming together , leads to a new renaissance .
It did this a thousand years ago .
The last 40 years have been extraordinary times .
Life expectancy has gone up by about 25 years .
It took from the Stone Age to achieve that .
Income has gone up for a majority of the world &apos;s population , despite the population going up by about two billion people over this period .
And illiteracy has gone down , from a half to about a quarter of the people on Earth .
A huge opportunity , unleashing of new potential for innovation , for development .
But there is an underbelly .
There are two Achilles &apos; heels of globalization .
There is the Achilles &apos; heel of growing inequality — those that are left out , those that feel angry , those that are not participating . Globalization has not been inclusive .
The second Achilles &apos; heel is complexity — a growing fragility , a growing brittleness .
What happens in one place very quickly affects everything else .
This is a systemic risk , systemic shock .
We &apos;ve seen it in the financial crisis . We &apos;ve seen it in the pandemic flu .
It will become virulent and it &apos;s something we have to build resilience against .
A lot of this is driven by what &apos;s happening in technology .
There have been huge leaps . There will be a million-fold improvement in what you can get for the same price in computing by 2030 .
That &apos;s what the experience of the last 20 years has been .
It will continue .
Our computers , our systems will be as primitive as the Apollo &apos;s are for today .
Our mobile phones are more powerful than the total Apollo space engine . Our mobile phones are more powerful than
some of the strongest computers of 20 years ago .
So what will this do ?
It will create huge opportunities in technology .
Miniaturization as well .
There will be invisible capacity . Invisible capacity in our bodies , in our brains , and in the air .
This is a dust mite on a nanoreplica .
This sort of ability to do everything in new ways unleashes potential , not least in the area of medicine .
This is a stem cell that we &apos;ve developed here in Oxford , from an embryonic stem cell .
We can develop any part of the body .
Increasingly , over time , this will be possible from our own skin — able to replicate parts of the body .
Fantastic potential for regenerative medicine .
I don &apos;t think there will be a Special Olympics long after 2030 , because of this capacity to regenerate parts of the body .
But the question is , &quot; &quot; Who will have it ? &quot; &quot; The other major development is going to be in the area of what can happen in genetics .
The capacity to create , as this mouse has been genetically modified , something which goes three times faster , lasts for three times longer , we could produce , as this mouse can , to the age of our equivalent of 80 years , using about the same amount of food .
But will this only be available for the super rich , for those that can afford it ? Are we headed for a new eugenics ?
Will only those that are able to afford it be able to be this super race of the future ?
( Laughter ) So the big question for us is , &quot; How do we manage this technological change ? &quot;
How do we ensure that it creates a more inclusive technology , a technology which means that not only as we grow older , that we can also grow wiser , and that we &apos;re able to support the populations of the future ?
One of the most dramatic manifestations of these improvements will be moving from population pyramids to what we might term population coffins .
There is unlikely to be a pension or a retirement age in 2030 .
These will be redundant concepts . And this isn &apos;t only something of the West .
The most dramatic changes will be the skyscraper type of new pyramids that will take place in China and in many other countries .
So forget about retirements if you &apos;re young .
Forget about pensions . Think about life and where it &apos;s going to be going .
Of course , migration will become even more important .
The war on talent , the need to attract people at all skill ranges , to push us around in our wheelchairs , but also to drive our economies . Our innovation will be vital .
The employment in the rich countries will go down from about 800 to about 700 million of these people .
This would imply a massive leap in migration .
So the concerns , the xenophobic concerns of today , of migration , will be turned on their head , as we search for people to help us sort out our pensions and our economies in the future .
And then , the systemic risks .
We understand that these will become much more virulent , that what we see today is this interweaving of societies , of systems , fastened by technologies and hastened by just-in-time management systems .
Small levels of stock push resilience into other people &apos;s responsibility .
The collapse in biodiversity , climate change , pandemics , financial crises : these will be the currency that we will think about .
And so a new awareness will have to arise , of how we deal with these , how we mobilize ourselves , in a new way , and come together as a community to manage systemic risk .
It &apos;s going to require innovation .
It &apos;s going to require an understanding that the glory of globalization could also be its downfall .
This could be our best century ever because of the achievements , or it could be our worst .
And of course we need to worry about the individuals , particularly the individuals that feel that they &apos;ve been left out in one way or another .
An individual , for the first time in the history of humanity , will have the capacity , by 2030 , to destroy the planet , to wreck everything , through the creation , for example , of a biopathogen .
How do we begin to weave these tapestries together ?
How do we think about complex systems in new ways ?
That will be the challenge of the scholars , and of all of us engaged in thinking about the future .
The rest of our lives will be in the future . We need to prepare for it now .
We need to understand that the governance structure in the world is fossilized .
It cannot begin to cope with the challenges that this will bring .
We have to develop a new way of managing the planet , collectively , through collective wisdom .
We know , and I know from my own experience , that amazing things can happen , when individuals and societies come together to change their future .
I left South Africa , and 15 years later , after thinking I would never go back , I had the privilege and the honor to work in the government of Nelson Mandela .
This was a miracle . We can create miracles , collectively , in our lifetime .
It is vital that we do so .
It is vital that the ideas that are nurtured in TED , that the ideas that we think about look forward , and make sure that this will be the most glorious century , and not one of eco-disaster and eco-collapse .
Thank you . ( Applause )
Nature &apos;s my muse and it &apos;s been my passion .
One early form left an imprint , like it died only yesterday .
And it has altered the Earth . It covers Earth like a skin .
So since I was here last in &apos; 06 , we discovered that global climate change is turning out to be a pretty serious issue , so we covered that fairly extensively in Skeptic magazine .
We investigate all kinds of scientific and quasi-scientific controversies , but it turns out we don &apos;t have to worry about any of this because the world &apos;s going to end in 2012 .
Another update : You will recall I introduced you guys to the Quadro Tracker .
It &apos;s like a water dowsing device .
It &apos;s just a hollow piece of plastic with an antenna that swivels around .
And you walk around , and it points to things .
Like if you &apos;re looking for marijuana in students &apos; lockers , it &apos;ll point right to somebody .
Oh , sorry . ( Laughter ) This particular one that was given to me finds golf balls , especially if you &apos;re at a golf course and you check under enough bushes .
Well , under the category of &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the harm of silly stuff like this ? &quot; &quot; this device , the ADE 651 , was sold to the Iraqi government for 40,000 dollars apiece .
It &apos;s just like this one , completely worthless , in which it allegedly worked by &quot; &quot; electrostatic magnetic ion attraction , &quot; &quot; which translates to &quot; &quot; pseudoscientific baloney &quot; &quot; — would be the nice word — in which you string together a bunch of words that sound good , but it does absolutely nothing .
In this case , at trespass points , allowing people to go through because your little tracker device said they were okay , actually cost lives .
So there is a danger to pseudoscience , in believing in this sort of thing .
So what I want to talk about today is belief .
I want to believe , and you do too .
And in fact , I think my thesis here is that belief is the natural state of things .
It is the default option . We just believe .
We believe all sorts of things .
Belief is natural ; disbelief , skepticism , science , is not natural .
It &apos;s more difficult .
It &apos;s uncomfortable to not believe things .
So like Fox Mulder on &quot; &quot; X-Files , &quot; &quot; who wants to believe in UFOs ? Well , we all do , and the reason for that is because we have a belief engine in our brains .
Essentially , we are pattern-seeking primates .
We connect the dots : A is connected to B ; B is connected to C.
And sometimes A really is connected to B , and that &apos;s called association learning .
We find patterns , we make those connections , whether it &apos;s Pavlov &apos;s dog here associating the sound of the bell with the food , and then he salivates to the sound of the bell , or whether it &apos;s a Skinnerian rat , in which he &apos;s having an association between his behavior and a reward for it , and therefore he repeats the behavior .
In fact , what Skinner discovered is that , if you put a pigeon in a box like this , and he has to press one of these two keys , and he tries to figure out what the pattern is , and you give him a little reward in the hopper box there — if you just randomly assign rewards such that there is no pattern , they will figure out any kind of pattern .
And whatever they were doing just before they got the reward , they repeat that particular pattern .
Sometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise , once clockwise and peck the key twice .
And that &apos;s called superstition , and that , I &apos;m afraid , we will always have with us .
I call this process &quot; &quot; patternicity &quot; &quot; — that is , the tendency to find meaningful patterns in both meaningful and meaningless noise .
When we do this process , we make two types of errors .
A Type I error , or false positive , is believing a pattern is real when it &apos;s not .
Our second type of error is a false negative .
A Type II error is not believing a pattern is real when it is .
So let &apos;s do a thought experiment .
You are a hominid three million years ago walking on the plains of Africa .
Your name is Lucy , okay ?
And you hear a rustle in the grass .
Is it a dangerous predator , or is it just the wind ?
Your next decision could be the most important one of your life .
Well , if you think that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator and it turns out it &apos;s just the wind , you &apos;ve made an error in cognition , made a Type I error , false positive .
But no harm . You just move away .
You &apos;re more cautious . You &apos;re more vigilant .
On the other hand , if you believe that the rustle in the grass is just the wind , and it turns out it &apos;s a dangerous predator , you &apos;re lunch .
You &apos;ve just won a Darwin award .
You &apos;ve been taken out of the gene pool .
Now the problem here is that patternicities will occur whenever the cost of making a Type I error is less than the cost of making a Type II error .
This is the only equation in the talk by the way .
We have a pattern detection problem that is assessing the difference between a Type I and a Type II error is highly problematic , especially in split-second , life-and-death situations .
So the default position is just : Believe all patterns are real — All rustles in the grass are dangerous predators and not just the wind .
And so I think that we evolved ...
there was a natural selection for the propensity for our belief engines , our pattern-seeking brain processes , to always find meaningful patterns and infuse them with these sort of predatory or intentional agencies that I &apos;ll come back to .
So for example , what do you see here ?
It &apos;s a horse head , that &apos;s right .
It looks like a horse . It must be a horse .
That &apos;s a pattern .
And is it really a horse ?
Or is it more like a frog ?
See , our pattern detection device , which appears to be located in the anterior cingulate cortex — it &apos;s our little detection device there — can be easily fooled , and this is the problem .
For example , what do you see here ?
Yes , of course , it &apos;s a cow .
Once I prime the brain — it &apos;s called cognitive priming — once I prime the brain to see it , it pops back out again even without the pattern that I &apos;ve imposed on it .
And what do you see here ?
Some people see a Dalmatian dog .
Yes , there it is . And there &apos;s the prime .
So when I go back without the prime , your brain already has the model so you can see it again .
What do you see here ?
Planet Saturn . Yes , that &apos;s good .
How about here ?
Just shout out anything you see .
That &apos;s a good audience , Chris .
Because there &apos;s nothing in this . Well , allegedly there &apos;s nothing .
This is an experiment done by Jennifer Whitson at U.T. Austin on corporate environments and whether feelings of uncertainty and out of control makes people see illusory patterns .
That is , almost everybody sees the planet Saturn .
People that are put in a condition of feeling out of control are more likely to see something in this , which is allegedly patternless .
In other words , the propensity to find these patterns goes up when there &apos;s a lack of control .
For example , baseball players are notoriously superstitious when they &apos;re batting , but not so much when they &apos;re fielding .
Because fielders are successful 90 to 95 percent of the time .
The best batters fail seven out of 10 times .
So their superstitions , their patternicities , are all associated with feelings of lack of control and so forth .
What do you see in this particular one here , in this field ?
Anybody see an object there ?
There actually is something here , but it &apos;s degraded .
While you &apos;re thinking about that , this was an experiment done by Susan Blackmore , a psychologist in England , who showed subjects this degraded image and then ran a correlation between their scores on an ESP test : How much did they believe in the paranormal , supernatural , angels and so forth .
And those who scored high on the ESP scale , tended to not only see more patterns in the degraded images but incorrect patterns .
Here is what you show subjects .
The fish is degraded 20 percent , 50 percent and then the one I showed you , 70 percent .
A similar experiment was done by another &#91; Swiss &#93; psychologist named Peter Brugger , who found significantly more meaningful patterns were perceived on the right hemisphere , via the left visual field , than the left hemisphere .
So if you present subjects the images such that it &apos;s going to end up on the right hemisphere instead of the left , then they &apos;re more likely to see patterns than if you put it on the left hemisphere .
Our right hemisphere appears to be where a lot of this patternicity occurs .
So what we &apos;re trying to do is bore into the brain to see where all this happens .
Brugger and his colleague , Christine Mohr , gave subjects L-DOPA .
L-DOPA &apos;s a drug , as you know , given for treating Parkinson &apos;s disease , which is related to a decrease in dopamine .
L-DOPA increases dopamine .
An increase of dopamine caused subjects to see more patterns than those that did not receive the dopamine .
So dopamine appears to be the drug associated with patternicity .
In fact , neuroleptic drugs that are used to eliminate psychotic behavior , things like paranoia , delusions and hallucinations , these are patternicities .
They &apos;re incorrect patterns . They &apos;re false positives . They &apos;re Type I errors .
And if you give them drugs that are dopamine antagonists , they go away .
That is , you decrease the amount of dopamine , and their tendency to see patterns like that decreases .
On the other hand , amphetamines like cocaine are dopamine agonists .
They increase the amount of dopamine .
So you &apos;re more likely to feel in a euphoric state , creativity , find more patterns .
In fact , I saw Robin Williams recently talk about how he thought he was much funnier when he was doing cocaine , when he had that issue , than now .
So perhaps more dopamine is related to more creativity .
Dopamine , I think , changes our signal-to-noise ratio .
That is , how accurate we are in finding patterns .
If it &apos;s too low , you &apos;re more likely to make too many Type II errors .
You miss the real patterns . You don &apos;t want to be too skeptical .
If you &apos;re too skeptical , you &apos;ll miss the really interesting good ideas .
Just right , you &apos;re creative , and yet you don &apos;t fall for too much baloney .
Too high and maybe you see patterns everywhere .
Every time somebody looks at you , you think people are staring at you .
You think people are talking about you .
And if you go too far on that , that &apos;s just simply labeled as madness .
It &apos;s a distinction perhaps we might make between two Nobel laureates , Richard Feynman and John Nash .
One sees maybe just the right number of patterns to win a Nobel Prize .
The other one also , but maybe too many patterns .
And we then call that schizophrenia .
So the signal-to-noise ratio then presents us with a pattern-detection problem .
And of course you all know exactly what this is , right ?
And what pattern do you see here ?
Again , I &apos;m putting your anterior cingulate cortex to the test here , causing you conflicting pattern detections .
You know , of course , this is Via Uno shoes .
These are sandals .
Pretty sexy feet , I must say .
Maybe a little Photoshopped .
And of course , the ambiguous figures that seem to flip-flop back and forth .
It turns out what you &apos;re thinking about a lot influences what you tend to see .
And you see the lamp here , I know .
Because the lights on here .
Of course , thanks to the environmentalist movement we &apos;re all sensitive to the plight of marine mammals .
So what you see in this particular ambiguous figure is , of course , the dolphins , right ?
You see a dolphin here , and there &apos;s a dolphin , and there &apos;s a dolphin .
That &apos;s a dolphin tail there , guys .
( Laughter ) If we can give you conflicting data , again , your ACC is going to be going into hyperdrive .
If you look down here , it &apos;s fine . If you look up here , then you get conflicting data .
And then we have to flip the image for you to see that it &apos;s a set up .
The impossible crate illusion .
It &apos;s easy to fool the brain in 2D .
So you say , &quot; &quot; Aw , come on Shermer , anybody can do that in a Psych 101 text with an illusion like that . &quot; &quot; Well here &apos;s the late , great Jerry Andrus &apos; &quot; &quot; impossible crate &quot; &quot; illusion in 3D , in which Jerry is standing inside the impossible crate .
And he was kind enough to post this and give us the reveal .
Of course , camera angle is everything . The photographer is over there , and this board appears to overlap with this one , and this one with that one , and so on .
But even when I take it away , the illusion is so powerful because of how are brains are wired to find those certain kinds of patterns .
This is a fairly new one that throws us off because of the conflicting patterns of comparing this angle with that angle .
In fact , it &apos;s the exact same picture side by side .
So what you &apos;re doing is comparing that angle instead of with this one , but with that one .
And so your brain is fooled .
Yet again , your pattern detection devices are fooled .
Faces are easy to see because we have an additional evolved facial recognition software in our temporal lobes .
Here &apos;s some faces on the side of a rock .
I &apos;m actually not even sure if this is — this might be Photoshopped .
But anyway , the point is still made .
Now which one of these looks odd to you ?
In a quick reaction , which one looks odd ?
The one on the left . Okay . So I &apos;ll rotate it so it &apos;ll be the one on the right .
And you are correct .
A fairly famous illusion — it was first done with Margaret Thatcher .
Now , they trade up the politicians every time .
Well , why is this happening ?
Well , we know exactly where it happens , in the temporal lobe , right across , sort of above your ear there , in a little structure called the fusiform gyrus .
And there &apos;s two types of cells that do this , that record facial features either globally , or specifically these large , rapid-firing cells , first look at the general face .
So you recognize Obama immediately .
And then you notice something quite a little bit odd about the eyes and the mouth .
Especially when they &apos;re upside down , you &apos;re engaging that general facial recognition software there .
Now I said back in our little thought experiment , you &apos;re a hominid walking on the plains of Africa .
Is it just the wind or a dangerous predator ?
What &apos;s the difference between those ?
Well , the wind is inanimate ; the dangerous predator is an intentional agent .
And I call this process agenticity .
That is the tendency to infuse patterns with meaning , intention and agency , often invisible beings from the top down .
This is an idea that we got from a fellow TEDster here , Dan Dennett , who talked about taking the intentional stance .
So it &apos;s a type of that expanded to explain , I think , a lot of different things : souls , spirits , ghosts , gods , demons , angels , aliens , intelligent designers , government conspiracists and all manner of invisible agents with power and intention , are believed to haunt our world and control our lives .
I think it &apos;s the basis of animism and polytheism and monotheism .
It &apos;s the belief that aliens are somehow more advanced than us , more moral than us , and the narratives always are that they &apos;re coming here to save us and rescue us from on high .
The intelligent designer &apos;s always portrayed as this super intelligent , moral being that comes down to design life .
Even the idea that government can rescue us — that &apos;s no longer the wave of the future , but that is , I think , a type of agenticity : projecting somebody up there , big and powerful , will come rescue us .
And this is also , I think , the basis of conspiracy theories .
There &apos;s somebody hiding behind there pulling the strings , whether it &apos;s the Illuminati or the Bilderbergers .
But this is a pattern detection problem , isn &apos;t it ?
Some patterns are real and some are not .
Was JFK assassinated by a conspiracy or by a lone assassin ?
Well , if you go there — there &apos;s people there on any given day — like when I went there , here — showing me where the different shooters were .
My favorite one was he was in the manhole .
And he popped out at the last second , took that shot .
But of course , Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy .
So we can &apos;t just uniformly dismiss all patterns like that .
Because , let &apos;s face it , some patterns are real .
Some conspiracies really are true .
Explains a lot , maybe .
And 9 / 11 has a conspiracy theory . It is a conspiracy .
We did a whole issue on it .
Nineteen members of Al Queda plotting to fly planes into buildings constitutes a conspiracy .
But that &apos;s not what the &quot; &quot; 9 / 11 truthers &quot; &quot; think .
They think it was an inside job by the Bush administration .
Well , that &apos;s a whole other lecture .
You know how we know that 9 / 11 was not orchestrated by the Bush administration ?
Because it worked .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So we are natural-born dualists .
Our agenticity process comes from the fact that we can enjoy movies like these .
Because we can imagine , in essence , continuing on .
We know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe , you can produce a feeling of out-of-body experiences , near-death experiences , which you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe there .
Or you can do it through loss of consciousness , by accelerating in a centrifuge .
You get a hypoxia , or a lower oxygen .
And the brain then senses that there &apos;s an out-of-body experience .
You can use — which I did , went out and did — Michael Persinger &apos;s God Helmet , that bombards your temporal lobes with electromagnetic waves .
And you get a sense of out-of-body experience .
So I &apos;m going to end here with a short video clip that sort of brings all this together .
It &apos;s just a minute and a half .
It ties together all this into the power of expectation and the power of belief .
Go ahead and roll it .
Narrator : This is the venue they chose for their fake auditions for an advert for lip balm .
Woman : We &apos;re hoping we can use part of this in a national commercial , right ?
And this is test on some lip balms that we have over here .
And these are our models who are going to help us , Roger and Matt .
And we have our own lip balm , and we have a leading brand .
Would you have any problem kissing our models to test it ?
Girl : No .
Woman : You wouldn &apos;t ? ( Girl : No . ) Woman : You &apos;d think that was fine .
Girl : That would be fine . ( Woman : Okay . ) So this is a blind test .
I &apos;m going to ask you to go ahead and put a blindfold on .
Kay , now can you see anything ? ( Girl : No . ) Pull it so you can &apos;t even see down . ( Girl : Okay . ) Woman : It &apos;s completely blind now , right ?
Girl : Yes . ( Woman : Okay . ) Now , what I &apos;m going to be looking for in this test is how it protects your lips , the texture , right , and maybe if you can discern any flavor or not .
Girl : Okay . ( Woman : Have you ever done a kissing test before ? ) Girl : No .
Woman : Take a step here .
Okay , now I &apos;m going to ask you to pucker up .
Pucker up big and lean in just a little bit , okay ?
( Music ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) Woman : Okay .
And , Jennifer , how did that feel ?
Jennifer : Good .
( Laughter ) Girl : Oh my God ! ( Laughter )
Michael Shermer : Thank you very much . Thank you . Thanks .
I &apos;m here to spread the word about the magnificence of spiders and how much we can learn from them .
Spiders are truly global citizens .
You can find spiders in nearly every terrestrial habitat .
This red dot marks the Great Basin of North America , and I &apos;m involved with an alpine biodiversity project there with some collaborators .
Here &apos;s one of our field sites , and just to give you a sense of perspective , this little blue smudge here , that &apos;s one of my collaborators .
This is a rugged and barren landscape , yet there are quite a few spiders here .
Turning rocks over revealed this crab spider grappling with a beetle .
Spiders are not just everywhere , but they &apos;re extremely diverse .
There are over 40,000 described species of spiders .
To put that number into perspective , here &apos;s a graph comparing the 40,000 species of spiders to the 400 species of primates .
There are two orders of magnitude more spiders than primates .
Spiders are also extremely old .
On the bottom here , this is the geologic timescale , and the numbers on it indicate millions of years from the present , so the zero here , that would be today .
So what this figure shows is that spiders date back to almost 380 million years .
To put that into perspective , this red vertical bar here marks the divergence time of humans from chimpanzees , a mere seven million years ago .
All spiders make silk at some point in their life .
Most spiders use copious amounts of silk , and silk is essential to their survival and reproduction .
Even fossil spiders can make silk , as we can see from this impression of a spinneret on this fossil spider .
So this means that both spiders and spider silk have been around for 380 million years .
It doesn &apos;t take long from working with spiders to start noticing how essential silk is to just about every aspect of their life .
Spiders use silk for many purposes , including the trailing safety dragline , wrapping eggs for reproduction , protective retreats and catching prey .
There are many kinds of spider silk .
For example , this garden spider can make seven different kinds of silks .
When you look at this orb web , you &apos;re actually seeing many types of silk fibers .
The frame and radii of this web is made up of one type of silk , while the capture spiral is a composite of two different silks : the filament and the sticky droplet .
How does an individual spider make so many kinds of silk ?
To answer that , you have to look a lot closer at the spinneret region of a spider .
So silk comes out of the spinnerets , and for those of us spider silk biologists , this is what we call the &quot; &quot; business end &quot; &quot; of the spider . ( Laughter ) We spend long days ...
Hey ! Don &apos;t laugh . That &apos;s my life .
( Laughter ) We spend long days and nights staring at this part of the spider .
And this is what we see .
You can see multiple fibers coming out of the spinnerets , because each spinneret has many spigots on it .
Each of these silk fibers exits from the spigot , and if you were to trace the fiber back into the spider , what you would find is that each spigot connects to its own individual silk gland . A silk gland kind of looks like a sac with a lot of silk proteins stuck inside .
So if you ever have the opportunity to dissect an orb-web-weaving spider , and I hope you do , what you would find is a bounty of beautiful , translucent silk glands .
Inside each spider , there are hundreds of silk glands , sometimes thousands .
These can be grouped into seven categories .
They differ by size , shape , and sometimes even color .
In an orb-web-weaving spider , you can find seven types of silk glands , and what I have depicted here in this picture , let &apos;s start at the one o &apos;clock position , there &apos;s tubuliform silk glands , which are used to make the outer silk of an egg sac .
There &apos;s the aggregate and flagelliform silk glands which combine to make the sticky capture spiral of an orb web .
Pyriform silk glands make the attachment cement — that &apos;s the silk that &apos;s used to adhere silk lines to a substrate .
There &apos;s also aciniform silk , which is used to wrap prey .
Minor ampullate silk is used in web construction .
And the most studied silk line of them all : major ampullate silk .
This is the silk that &apos;s used to make the frame and radii of an orb web , and also the safety trailing dragline .
But what , exactly , is spider silk ?
Spider silk is almost entirely protein .
Nearly all of these proteins can be explained by a single gene family , so this means that the diversity of silk types we see today is encoded by one gene family , so presumably the original spider ancestor made one kind of silk , and over the last 380 million years , that one silk gene has duplicated and then diverged , specialized , over and over and over again , to get the large variety of flavors of spider silks that we have today .
There are several features that all these silks have in common . They all have a common design , such as they &apos;re all very long — they &apos;re sort of outlandishly long compared to other proteins .
They &apos;re very repetitive , and they &apos;re very rich in the amino acids glycine and alanine .
To give you an idea of what a spider silk protein looks like , this is a dragline silk protein , it &apos;s just a portion of it , from the black widow spider .
This is the kind of sequence that I love looking at day and night . ( Laughter ) So what you &apos;re seeing here is the one letter abbreviation for amino acids , and I &apos;ve colored in the glycines with green , and the alanines in red , and so you can see it &apos;s just a lot of G &apos;s and A &apos;s .
You can also see that there &apos;s a lot of short sequence motifs that repeat over and over and over again , so for example there &apos;s a lot of what we call polyalanines , or iterated A &apos;s , AAAAA . There &apos;s GGQ . There &apos;s GGY .
You can think of these short motifs that repeat over and over again as words , and these words occur in sentences .
So for example this would be one sentence , and you would get this sort of green region and the red polyalanine , that repeats over and over and over again , and you can have that hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times within an individual silk molecule .
Silks made by the same spider can have dramatically different repeat sequences .
At the top of the screen , you &apos;re seeing the repeat unit from the dragline silk of a garden argiope spider .
It &apos;s short . And on the bottom , this is the repeat sequence for the egg case , or tubuliform silk protein , for the exact same spider . And you can see how dramatically different these silk proteins are — so this is sort of the beauty of the diversification of the spider silk gene family .
You can see that the repeat units differ in length . They also differ in sequence .
So I &apos;ve colored in the glycines again in green , alanine in red , and the serines , the letter S , in purple . And you can see that the top repeat unit can be explained almost entirely by green and red , and the bottom repeat unit has a substantial amount of purple .
What silk biologists do is we try to relate these sequences , these amino acid sequences , to the mechanical properties of the silk fibers .
Now , it &apos;s really convenient that spiders use their silk completely outside their body .
This makes testing spider silk really , really easy to do in the laboratory , because we &apos;re actually , you know , testing it in air that &apos;s exactly the environment that spiders are using their silk proteins .
So this makes quantifying silk properties by methods such as tensile testing , which is basically , you know , tugging on one end of the fiber , very amenable .
Here are stress-strain curves generated by tensile testing five fibers made by the same spider .
So what you can see here is that the five fibers have different behaviors .
Specifically , if you look on the vertical axis , that &apos;s stress . If you look at the maximum stress value for each of these fibers , you can see that there &apos;s a lot of variation , and in fact dragline , or major ampullate silk , is the strongest of these fibers .
We think that &apos;s because the dragline silk , which is used to make the frame and radii for a web , needs to be very strong .
On the other hand , if you were to look at strain — this is how much a fiber can be extended — if you look at the maximum value here , again , there &apos;s a lot of variation and the clear winner is flagelliform , or the capture spiral filament .
In fact , this flagelliform fiber can actually stretch over twice its original length .
So silk fibers vary in their strength and also their extensibility .
In the case of the capture spiral , it needs to be so stretchy to absorb the impact of flying prey .
If it wasn &apos;t able to stretch so much , then basically when an insect hit the web , it would just trampoline right off of it .
So if the web was made entirely out of dragline silk , an insect is very likely to just bounce right off . But by having really , really stretchy capture spiral silk , the web is actually able to absorb the impact of that intercepted prey .
There &apos;s quite a bit of variation within the fibers that an individual spider can make .
We call that the tool kit of a spider .
That &apos;s what the spider has to interact with their environment .
But how about variation among spider species , so looking at one type of silk and looking at different species of spiders ?
This is an area that &apos;s largely unexplored but here &apos;s a little bit of data I can show you .
This is the comparison of the toughness of the dragline spilk spun by 21 species of spiders .
Some of them are orb-weaving spiders and some of them are non-orb-weaving spiders .
It &apos;s been hypothesized that orb-weaving spiders , like this argiope here , should have the toughest dragline silks because they must intercept flying prey .
What you see here on this toughness graph is the higher the black dot is on the graph , the higher the toughness .
The 21 species are indicated here by this phylogeny , this evolutionary tree , that shows their genetic relationships , and I &apos;ve colored in yellow the orb-web-weaving spiders .
If you look right here at the two red arrows , they point to the toughness values for the draglines of nephila clavipes and araneus diadematus .
These are the two species of spiders for which the vast majority of time and money on synthetic spider silk research has been to replicate their dragline silk proteins .
Yet , their draglines are not the toughest .
In fact , the toughest dragline in this survey is this one right here in this white region , a non orb-web-weaving spider .
This is the dragline spun by scytodes , the spitting spider .
Scytodes doesn &apos;t use a web at all to catch prey . Instead , scytodes sort of lurks around and waits for prey to get close to it , and then immobilizes prey by spraying a silk-like venom onto that insect .
Think of hunting with silly string .
That &apos;s how scytodes forages .
We don &apos;t really know why scytodes needs such a tough dragline , but it &apos;s unexpected results like this that make bio-prospecting so exciting and worthwhile .
It frees us from the constraints of our imagination .
Now I &apos;m going to mark on the toughness values for nylon fiber , bombyx — or domesticated silkworm silk — wool , Kevlar , and carbon fibers .
And what you can see is that nearly all the spider draglines surpass them .
It &apos;s the combination of strength , extensibility and toughness that makes spider silk so special , and that has attracted the attention of biomimeticists , so people that turn to nature to try to find new solutions .
And the strength , extensibility and toughness of spider silks combined with the fact that silks do not elicit an immune response , have attracted a lot of interest in the use of spider silks in biomedical applications , for example , as a component of artificial tendons , for serving as guides to regrow nerves , and for scaffolds for tissue growth .
Spider silks also have a lot of potential for their anti-ballistic capabilities .
Silks could be incorporated into body and equipment armor that would be more lightweight and flexible than any armor available today .
In addition to these biomimetic applications of spider silks , personally , I find studying spider silks just fascinating in and of itself .
I love when I &apos;m in the laboratory , a new spider silk sequence comes in .
That &apos;s just the best . ( Laughter ) It &apos;s like the spiders are sharing an ancient secret with me , and that &apos;s why I &apos;m going to spend the rest of my life studying spider silk .
The next time you see a spider web , please , pause and look a little closer .
You &apos;ll be seeing one of the most high-performance materials known to man .
To borrow from the writings of a spider named Charlotte , silk is terrific .
Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
We stumbled on your video on decimals , and it got through .
The ones I started were much more primitive .
And the Khan Academy videos are there .
Green means the student &apos;s already proficient .
Tell me what you &apos;re thinking there .
( Applause )
So , I want to start out with this beautiful picture from my childhood .
I love the science fiction movies .
Here it is : &quot; &quot; This Island Earth . &quot; &quot; And leave it to Hollywood to get it just right .
Two-and-a-half years in the making .
( Laughter ) I mean , even the creationists give us 6,000 , but Hollywood goes to the chase .
And in this movie , we see what we think is out there : flying saucers and aliens .
Every world has an alien , and every alien world has a flying saucer , and they move about with great speed . Aliens .
Well , Don Brownlee , my friend , and I finally got to the point where we got tired of turning on the TV and seeing the spaceships and seeing the aliens every night , and tried to write a counter-argument to it , and put out what does it really take for an Earth to be habitable , for a planet to be an Earth , to have a place where you could probably get not just life , but complexity , which requires a huge amount of evolution , and therefore constancy of conditions .
So , in 2000 we wrote &quot; &quot; Rare Earth . &quot; &quot; In 2003 , we then asked , let &apos;s not think about where Earths are in space , but how long has Earth been Earth ?
If you go back two billion years , you &apos;re not on an Earth-like planet any more .
What we call an Earth-like planet is actually a very short interval of time .
Well , &quot; &quot; Rare Earth &quot; &quot; actually taught me an awful lot about meeting the public .
Right after , I got an invitation to go to a science fiction convention , and with all great earnestness walked in .
David Brin was going to debate me on this , and as I walked in , the crowd of a hundred started booing lustily .
I had a girl who came up who said , &quot; &quot; My dad says you &apos;re the devil . &quot; &quot; You cannot take people &apos;s aliens away from them and expect to be anybody &apos;s friends .
Well , the second part of that , soon after — and I was talking to Paul Allen ; I saw him in the audience , and I handed him a copy of &quot; &quot; Rare Earth . &quot; &quot; And Jill Tarter was there , and she turned to me , and she looked at me just like that girl in &quot; &quot; The Exorcist . &quot; &quot; It was , &quot; &quot; It burns ! It burns ! &quot; &quot; Because SETI doesn &apos;t want to hear this .
SETI wants there to be stuff out there .
I really applaud the SETI efforts , but we have not heard anything yet .
And I really do think we have to start thinking about what &apos;s a good planet and what isn &apos;t .
Now , I throw this slide up because it indicates to me that , even if SETI does hear something , can we figure out what they said ?
Because this was a slide that was passed between the two major intelligences on Earth — a Mac to a PC — and it can &apos;t even get the letters right — ( Laughter ) — so how are we going to talk to the aliens ?
And if they &apos;re 50 light years away , and we call them up , and you blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , and then 50 years later it comes back and they say , Please repeat ?
I mean , there we are .
Our planet is a good planet because it can keep water .
Mars is a bad planet , but it &apos;s still good enough for us to go there and to live on its surface if we &apos;re protected .
But Venus is a very bad — the worst — planet .
Even though it &apos;s Earth-like , and even though early in its history it may very well have harbored Earth-like life , it soon succumbed to runaway greenhouse — that &apos;s an 800 degrees &#91; Fahrenheit &#93; surface — because of rampant carbon dioxide .
Well , we know from astrobiology that we can really now predict what &apos;s going to happen to our particular planet .
We are right now in the beautiful Oreo of existence — of at least life on Planet Earth — following the first horrible microbial age .
In the Cambrian explosion , life emerged from the swamps , complexity arose , and from what we can tell , we &apos;re halfway through .
We have as much time for animals to exist on this planet as they have been here now , till we hit the second microbial age .
And that will happen , paradoxically — everything you hear about global warming — when we hit CO2 down to 10 parts per million , we are no longer going to have to have plants that are allowed to have any photosynthesis , and there go animals .
So , after that we probably have seven billion years .
The Sun increases in its intensity , in its brightness , and finally , at about 12 billion years after it first started , the Earth is consumed by a large Sun , and this is what &apos;s left .
So , a planet like us is going to have an age and an old age , and we are in its golden summer age right now .
But there &apos;s two fates to everything , isn &apos;t there ?
Now , a lot of you are going to die of old age , but some of you , horribly enough , are going to die in an accident .
And that &apos;s the fate of a planet , too .
Earth , if we &apos;re lucky enough — if it doesn &apos;t get hit by a Hale-Bopp , or gets blasted by some supernova nearby in the next seven billion years — we &apos;ll find under your feet .
But what about accidental death ?
Well , paleontologists for the last 200 years have been charting death . It &apos;s strange — extinction as a concept wasn &apos;t even thought about until Baron Cuvier in France found this first mastodon .
He couldn &apos;t match it up to any bones on the planet , and he said , Aha ! It &apos;s extinct .
And very soon after , the fossil record started yielding a very good idea of how many plants and animals there have been since complex life really began to leave a very interesting fossil record .
In that complex record of fossils , there were times when lots of stuff seemed to be dying out very quickly , and the father / mother geologists called these &quot; &quot; mass extinctions . &quot; &quot; All along it was thought to be either an act of God or perhaps long , slow climate change , and that really changed in 1980 , in this rocky outcrop near Gubbio , where Walter Alvarez , trying to figure out what was the time difference between these white rocks , which held creatures of the Cretaceous period , and the pink rocks above , which held Tertiary fossils .
How long did it take to go from one system to the next ?
And what they found was something unexpected .
They found in this gap , in between , a very thin clay layer , and that clay layer — this very thin red layer here — is filled with iridium .
And not just iridium ; it &apos;s filled with glassy spherules , and it &apos;s filled with quartz grains that have been subjected to enormous pressure : shock quartz .
Now , in this slide the white is chalk , and this chalk was deposited in a warm ocean .
The chalk itself &apos;s composed by plankton which has fallen down from the sea surface onto the sea floor , so that 90 percent of the sediment here is skeleton of living stuff , and then you have that millimeter-thick red layer , and then you have black rock .
And the black rock is the sediment on the sea bottom in the absence of plankton .
And that &apos;s what happens in an asteroid catastrophe , because that &apos;s what this was , of course . This is the famous K-T .
A 10-kilometer body hit the planet .
The effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet , and we had very quickly the death of the dinosaurs , the death of these beautiful ammonites , Leconteiceras here , and Celaeceras over here , and so much else .
I mean , it must be true , because we &apos;ve had two Hollywood blockbusters since that time , and this paradigm , from 1980 to about 2000 , totally changed how we geologists thought about catastrophes .
Prior to that , uniformitarianism was the dominant paradigm : the fact that if anything happens on the planet in the past , there are present-day processes that will explain it .
But we haven &apos;t witnessed a big asteroid impact , so this is a type of neo-catastrophism , and it took about 20 years for the scientific establishment to finally come to grips : yes , we were hit ; and yes , the effects of that hit caused a major mass extinction .
Well , there are five major mass extinctions over the last 500 million years , called the Big Five .
They range from 450 million years ago to the last , the K-T , number four , but the biggest of all was the P , or the Permian extinction , sometimes called the mother of all mass extinctions .
And every one of these has been subsequently blamed on large-body impact .
But is this true ?
The most recent , the Permian , was thought to have been an impact because of this beautiful structure on the right .
This is a Buckminsterfullerene , a carbon-60 .
Because it looks like those terrible geodesic domes of my late beloved &apos; 60s , they &apos;re called &quot; &quot; buckyballs . &quot; &quot; This evidence was used to suggest that at the end of the Permian , 250 million years ago , a comet hit us .
And when the comet hits , the pressure produces the buckyballs , and it captures bits of the comet .
Helium-3 : very rare on the surface of the Earth , very common in space .
But is this true ?
In 1990 , working on the K-T extinction for 10 years , I moved to South Africa to begin work twice a year in the great Karoo desert .
I was so lucky to watch the change of that South Africa into the new South Africa as I went year by year .
And I worked on this Permian extinction , camping by this Boer graveyard for months at a time .
And the fossils are extraordinary .
You know , you &apos;re gazing upon your very distant ancestors .
These are mammal-like reptiles .
They are culturally invisible . We do not make movies about these .
This is a Gorgonopsian , or a Gorgon .
That &apos;s an 18-inch long skull of an animal that was probably seven or eight feet , sprawled like a lizard , probably had a head like a lion .
This is the top carnivore , the T-Rex of its time .
But there &apos;s lots of stuff .
This is my poor son , Patrick .
( Laughter ) This is called paleontological child abuse .
Hold still , you &apos;re the scale .
( Laughter ) There was big stuff back then .
Fifty-five species of mammal-like reptiles .
The age of mammals had well and truly started 250 million years ago ...
... and then a catastrophe happened .
And what happens next is the age of dinosaurs .
It was all a mistake ; it should have never happened . But it did .
Now , luckily , this Thrinaxodon , the size of a robin egg here : this is a skull I &apos;ve discovered just before taking this picture — there &apos;s a pen for scale ; it &apos;s really tiny — this is in the Lower Triassic , after the mass extinction has finished .
You can see the eye socket and you can see the little teeth in the front .
If that does not survive , I &apos;m not the thing giving this talk .
Something else is , because if that doesn &apos;t survive , we are not here ; there are no mammals . It &apos;s that close ; one species ekes through .
Well , can we say anything about the pattern of who survives and who doesn &apos;t ?
Here &apos;s sort of the end of that 10 years of work .
The ranges of stuff — the red line is the mass extinction .
But we &apos;ve got survivors and things that get through , and it turns out the things that get through preferentially are cold bloods .
Warm-blooded animals take a huge hit at this time .
The survivors that do get through produce this world of crocodile-like creatures .
There &apos;s no dinosaurs yet ; just this slow , saurian , scaly , nasty , swampy place with a couple of tiny mammals hiding in the fringes .
And there they would hide for 160 million years , until liberated by that K-T asteroid .
So , if not impact , what ?
And the what , I think , is that we returned , over and over again , to the Pre-Cambrian world , that first microbial age , and the microbes are still out there .
They hate we animals .
They really want their world back .
And they &apos;ve tried over and over and over again .
This suggests to me that life causing these mass extinctions because it did is inherently anti-Gaian .
This whole Gaia idea , that life makes the world better for itself — anybody been on a freeway on a Friday afternoon in Los Angeles believing in the Gaia theory ? No .
So , I really suspect there &apos;s an alternative , and that life does actually try to do itself in — not consciously , but just because it does .
And here &apos;s the weapon , it seems , that it did so over the last 500 million years .
There are microbes which , through their metabolism , produce hydrogen sulfide , and they do so in large amounts .
Hydrogen sulfide is very fatal to we humans .
As small as 200 parts per million will kill you .
You only have to go to the Black Sea and a few other places — some lakes — and get down , and you &apos;ll find that the water itself turns purple .
It turns purple from the presence of numerous microbes which have to have sunlight and have to have hydrogen sulfide , and we can detect their presence today — we can see them — but we can also detect their presence in the past .
And the last three years have seen an enormous breakthrough in a brand-new field .
I am almost extinct — I &apos;m a paleontologist who collects fossils .
But the new wave of paleontologists — my graduate students — collect biomarkers .
They take the sediment itself , they extract the oil from it , and from that they can produce compounds which turn out to be very specific to particular microbial groups .
It &apos;s because lipids are so tough , they can get preserved in sediment and last the hundreds of millions of years necessary , and be extracted and tell us who was there .
And we know who was there . At the end of the Permian , at many of these mass extinction boundaries , this is what we find : isorenieratene . It &apos;s very specific .
It can only occur if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen , and is totally saturated with hydrogen sulfide — enough , for instance , to come out of solution .
This led Lee Kump , and others from Penn State and my group , to propose what I call the Kump Hypothesis : many of the mass extinctions were caused by lowering oxygen , by high CO2 . And the worst effect of global warming , it turns out : hydrogen sulfide being produced out of the oceans .
Well , what &apos;s the source of this ?
In this particular case , the source over and over has been flood basalts .
This is a view of the Earth now , if we extract a lot of it .
And each of these looks like a hydrogen bomb ; actually , the effects are even worse .
This is when deep-Earth material comes to the surface , spreads out over the surface of the planet .
Well , it &apos;s not the lava that kills anything , it &apos;s the carbon dioxide that comes out with it .
This isn &apos;t Volvos ; this is volcanoes .
But carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide .
So , these are new data Rob Berner and I — from Yale — put together , and what we try to do now is track the amount of carbon dioxide in the entire rock record — and we can do this from a variety of means — and put all the red lines here , when these — what I call greenhouse mass extinctions — took place .
And there &apos;s two things that are really evident here to me , is that these extinctions take place when CO2 is going up .
But the second thing that &apos;s not shown on here : the Earth has never had any ice on it when we &apos;ve had 1,000 parts per million CO2 .
We are at 380 and climbing .
We should be up to a thousand in three centuries at the most , but my friend David Battisti in Seattle says he thinks a 100 years .
So , there goes the ice caps , and there comes 240 feet of sea level rise .
I live in a view house now ; I &apos;m going to have waterfront .
All right , what &apos;s the consequence ? The oceans probably turn purple .
And we think this is the reason that complexity took so long to take place on planet Earth .
We had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period .
They stop complex life from existing .
We know hydrogen sulfide is erupting presently a few places on the planet .
And I throw this slide in — this is me , actually , two months ago — and I throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal , chambered nautilus .
It &apos;s been on this planet since the animals first started — 500 million years .
This is a tracking experiment , and any of you scuba divers , if you want to get involved in one of the coolest projects ever , this is off the Great Barrier Reef .
And as we speak now , these nautilus are tracking out their behaviors to us .
But the thing about this is that every once in a while we divers can run into trouble , so I &apos;m going to do a little thought experiment here .
This is a Great White Shark that ate some of my traps .
We pulled it up ; up it comes . So , it &apos;s out there with me at night .
So , I &apos;m swimming along , and it takes off my leg .
I &apos;m 80 miles from shore , what &apos;s going to happen to me ?
Well now , I die .
Five years from now , this is what I hope happens to me : I &apos;m taken back to the boat , I &apos;m given a gas mask : 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide .
I &apos;m then thrown in an ice pond , I &apos;m cooled 15 degrees lower and I could be taken to a critical care hospital .
And the reason I could do that is because we mammals have gone through a series of these hydrogen sulfide events , and our bodies have adapted .
And we can now use this as what I think will be a major medical breakthrough .
This is Mark Roth . He was funded by DARPA .
Tried to figure out how to save Americans after battlefield injuries .
He bleeds out pigs .
He puts in 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide — the same stuff that survived these past mass extinctions — and he turns a mammal into a reptile .
&quot; &quot; I believe we are seeing in this response the result of mammals and reptiles having undergone a series of exposures to H2S . &quot; &quot; I got this email from him two years ago ; he said , &quot; &quot; I think I &apos;ve got an answer to some of your questions . &quot; &quot; So , he now has taken mice down for as many as four hours , sometimes six hours , and these are brand-new data he sent me on the way over here .
On the top , now , that is a temperature record of a mouse who has gone through — the dotted line , the temperatures .
So , the temperature starts at 25 centigrade , and down it goes , down it goes .
Six hours later , up goes the temperature .
Now , the same mouse is given 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide in this solid graph , and look what happens to its temperature .
Its temperature drops .
It goes down to 15 degrees centigrade from 35 , and comes out of this perfectly fine .
Here is a way we can get people to critical care .
Here &apos;s how we can bring people cold enough to last till we get critical care .
Now , you &apos;re all thinking , yeah , what about the brain tissue ?
And so this is one of the great challenges that is going to happen .
You &apos;re in an accident . You &apos;ve got two choices : you &apos;re going to die , or you &apos;re going to take the hydrogen sulfide and , say , 75 percent of you is saved , mentally .
What are you going to do ?
Do we all have to have a little button saying , Let me die ?
This is coming towards us , and I think this is going to be a revolution .
We &apos;re going to save lives , but there &apos;s going to be a cost to it .
The new view of mass extinctions is , yes , we were hit , and , yes , we have to think about the long term , because we will get hit again .
But there &apos;s a far worse danger confronting us .
We can easily go back to the hydrogen sulfide world .
Give us a few millennia — and we humans should last those few millennia — will it happen again ? If we continue , it &apos;ll happen again .
How many of us flew here ?
How many of us have gone through our entire Kyoto quota just for flying this year ?
How many of you have exceeded it ? Yeah , I &apos;ve certainly exceeded it .
We have a huge problem facing us as a species .
We have to beat this .
I want to be able to go back to this reef . Thank you .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : I &apos;ve just got one question for you , Peter .
Am I understanding you right , that what you &apos;re saying here is that we have in our own bodies a biochemical response to hydrogen sulfide that in your mind proves that there have been past mass extinctions due to climate change ?
Peter Ward : Yeah , every single cell in us can produce minute quantities of hydrogen sulfide in great crises .
This is what Roth has found out .
So , what we &apos;re looking at now : does it leave a signal ?
Does it leave a signal in bone or in plant ?
And we go back to the fossil record and we could try to detect how many of these have happened in the past .
CA : It &apos;s simultaneously an incredible medical technique , but also a terrifying ...
PW : Blessing and curse .
Well , I &apos;m involved in other things , besides physics .
In fact , mostly now in other things .
One thing is distant relationships among human languages .
And the professional , historical linguists in the U.S.
and in Western Europe mostly try to stay away from any long-distance relationships , big groupings , groupings that go back a long time , longer than the familiar families .
They don &apos;t like that . They think it &apos;s crank . I don &apos;t think it &apos;s crank .
And there are some brilliant linguists , mostly Russians , who are working on that , at Santa Fe Institute and in Moscow , and I would love to see where that leads .
Does it really lead to a single ancestor some 20 , 25,000 years ago ?
And what if we go back beyond that single ancestor , when there was presumably a competition among many languages ?
How far back does that go ? How far back does modern language go ?
How many tens of thousands of years does it go back ?
Chris Anderson : Do you have a hunch or a hope for what the answer to that is ?
Murray Gell-Mann : Well , I would guess that modern language must be older than the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures and dance steps in the soft clay in the caves in Western Europe , in the Aurignacian Period some 35,000 years ago , or earlier .
I can &apos;t believe they did all those things and didn &apos;t also have a modern language .
So , I would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further .
But that doesn &apos;t mean that all , or many , or most of today &apos;s attested languages couldn &apos;t descend perhaps from one that &apos;s much younger than that , like say 20,000 years , or something of that kind . It &apos;s what we call a bottleneck .
CA : Well , Philip Anderson may have been right .
You may just know more about everything than anyone .
So , it &apos;s been an honor . Thank you Murray Gell-Mann .
( Applause )
The stories we tell about each other matter very much .
The stories we tell ourselves about our own lives matter .
And most of all , I think the way that we participate in each other &apos;s stories is of deep importance .
I was six years old when I first heard stories about the poor .
Now I didn &apos;t hear those stories from the poor themselves , I heard them from my Sunday school teacher and Jesus , kind of via my Sunday school teacher .
I remember learning that people who were poor needed something material — food , clothing , shelter — that they didn &apos;t have .
And I also was taught , coupled with that , that it was my job — this classroom full of five and six year-old children — it was our job , apparently , to help .
This is what Jesus asked of us .
And then he said , &quot; &quot; What you do for the least of these , you do for me . &quot; &quot; Now I was pretty psyched .
I was very eager to be useful in the world — I think we all have that feeling .
And also , it was kind of interesting that God needed help .
That was news to me , and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in .
But I also learned very soon thereafter that Jesus also said , and I &apos;m paraphrasing , the poor would always be with us .
This frustrated and confused me ; I felt like I had been just given a homework assignment that I had to do , and I was excited to do , but no matter what I would do , I would fail .
So I felt confused , a little bit frustrated and angry , like maybe I &apos;d misunderstood something here .
And I felt overwhelmed .
And for the first time , I began to fear this group of people and to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people .
I imagined in my head , a kind of long line of individuals that were never going away , that would always be with us .
They were always going to ask me to help them and give them things , which I was excited to do , but I didn &apos;t know how it was going to work .
And I didn &apos;t know what would happen when I ran out of things to give , especially if the problem was never going away .
In the years following , the other stories I heard about the poor growing up were no more positive .
For example , I saw pictures and images frequently of sadness and suffering .
I heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor .
I heard about disease , I heard about war — they always seemed to be kind of related .
And in general , I got this sort of idea that the poor in the world lived lives that were wrought with suffering and sadness , devastation , hopelessness .
And after a while , I developed what I think many of us do , is this predictable response , where I started to feel bad every time I heard about them .
I started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth , because I wasn &apos;t doing more , apparently , to make things better .
And I even felt a sense of shame because of that .
And so naturally , I started to distance myself .
I stopped listening to their stories quite as closely as I had before .
And I stopped expecting things to really change .
Now I still gave — on the outside it looked like I was still quite involved .
I gave of my time and my money , I gave when solutions were on sale .
The cost of a cup of coffee can save a child &apos;s life , right .
I mean who can argue with that ?
I gave when I was cornered , when it was difficult to avoid and I gave , in general , when the negative emotions built up enough that I gave to relieve my own suffering , not someone else &apos;s .
The truth be told , I was giving out of that place , not out of a genuine place of hope and excitement to help and of generosity .
It became a transaction for me , became sort of a trade .
I was purchasing something — I was buying my right to go on with my day and not necessarily be bothered by this bad news .
And I think the way that we go through that sometimes can , first of all , disembody a group of people , individuals out there in the world .
And it can also turn into a commodity , which is a very scary thing .
So as I did this , and as I think many of us do this , we kind of buy our distance , we kind of buy our right to go on with our day .
I think that exchange can actually get in the way of the very thing that we want most .
It can get in the way of our desire to really be meaningful and useful in another person &apos;s life and , in short to love .
Thankfully , a few years ago , things shifted for me because I heard this gentleman speak , Dr. Muhammad Yunus .
I know many in the room probably know exactly who he is , but to give the shorthand version for any who have not heard him speak , Dr. Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago for his work pioneering modern microfinance .
When I heard him speak , it was three years before that .
But basically , microfinance — if this is new to you as well — think of that as financial services for the poor .
Think of all the things you get at your bank and imagine those products and services tailored to the needs of someone living on a few dollars a day .
Dr. Yunus shared his story , explaining what that was , and what he had done with his Grameen Bank .
He also talked about , in particular , microlending , which is a tiny loan that could help someone start or grow a business .
Now , when I heard him speak , it was exciting for a number of reasons .
First and foremost , I learned about this new method of change in the world that , for once , showed me , maybe , a way to interact with someone and to give , to share of a resource in a way that wasn &apos;t weird and didn &apos;t make me feel bad — that was exciting .
But more importantly , he told stories about the poor that were different than any stories I had heard before .
In fact , those individuals he talked about who were poor was sort of a side note .
He was talking about strong , smart , hardworking entrepreneurs who woke up every day and were doing things to make their lives and their family &apos;s lives better .
All they needed to do that more quickly and to do it better was a little bit of capital .
It was an amazing sort of insight for me .
And I , in fact , was so deeply moved by this — it &apos;s hard to express now how much that affected me — but I was so moved that I actually quit my job a few weeks later , and I moved to East Africa to try to see for myself what this was about .
For the first time , actually , in a long time I wanted to meet those individuals , I wanted to meet these entrepreneurs , and see for myself what their lives were actually about .
So I spent three months in Kenya , Uganda and Tanzania interviewing entrepreneurs that had received 100 dollars to start or grow a business .
And in fact , through those interactions , for the first time , I was starting to get to be friends with some of those people in that big amorphous group out there that was supposed to be far away .
I was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories .
And over and over again , as I interviewed them and spent my days with them , I did hear stories of life change and amazing little details of change .
So I would hear from goat herders who had used that money that they had received to buy a few more goats .
Their business trajectory would change .
They would make a little bit more money ; their standard of living would shift and would get better .
And they would make really interesting little adjustments in their lives , like they would start to send their children to school .
They might be able to buy mosquito nets .
Maybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure .
Maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea and offer that to me when I came as their guest and that made them feel proud .
But there were these beautiful details , even if I talked to 20 goat herders in a row , and some days that &apos;s what happened — these beautiful details of life change that were meaningful to them .
That was another thing that really touched me .
It was really humbling to see for the first time , to really understand that even if I could have taken a magic wand and fixed everything , I probably would have gotten a lot wrong .
Because the best way for people to change their lives is for them to have control and to do that in a way that they believe is best for them .
So I saw that and it was very humbling .
Anyway , another interesting thing happened while I was there .
I never once was asked for a donation , which had kind of been my mode , right .
There &apos;s poverty , you give money to help — no one asked me for a donation .
In fact , no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all .
If anything , they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing already and to build on their own capabilities .
So what I did hear , once in a while , was that people wanted a loan — I thought that sounded very reasonable and really exciting .
And by the way , I was a philosophy and poetry major in school , so I didn &apos;t know the difference between profit and revenue when I went to East Africa .
I just got this impression that the money would work .
And my introduction to business was in these $ 100 little infuses of capital .
And I learned about profit and revenue , about leverage , all sorts of things , from farmers , from seamstresses , from goat herders .
So this idea that these new stories of business and hope might be shared with my friends and family , and through that , maybe we could get some of the money that they needed to be able to continue their businesses as loans , that &apos;s this little idea that turned into Kiva .
A few months later , I went back to Uganda with a digital camera and a basic website that my partner , Matthew , and I had kind of built , and took pictures of seven of my new friends , posted their stories , these stories of entrepreneurship , up on the website , spammed friends and family and said , &quot; &quot; We think this is legal .
Haven &apos;t heard back yet from SEC on all the details , but do you say , do you want to help participate in this , provide the money that they need ? &quot; &quot; The money came in basically overnight .
We sent it over to Uganda .
And over the next six months , a beautiful thing happened ; the entrepreneurs received the money , they were paid , and their businesses , in fact , grew , and they were able to support themselves and change the trajectory of their lives .
In October of &apos; 05 , after those first seven loans were paid , Matt and I took the word beta off of the site .
We said , &quot; &quot; Our little experiment has been a success .
Let &apos;s start for real . &quot; &quot; That was our official launch .
And then that first year , October &apos; 05 through &apos; 06 , Kiva facilitated $ 500,000 in loans .
The second year , it was a total of 15 million .
The third year , the total was up to around 40 .
The fourth year , we were just short of 100 .
And today , less than five years in , Kiva &apos;s facilitated more than 150 million dollars , in little 25-dollar bits , from lenders and entrepreneurs — more than a million of those , collectively in 200 countries .
So that &apos;s where Kiva is today , just to bring you right up to the present .
And while those numbers and those statistics are really fun to talk about and they &apos;re interesting , to me , Kiva &apos;s really about stories .
It &apos;s about retelling the story of the poor , and it &apos;s about giving ourselves an opportunity to engage that validates their dignity , validates a partnership relationship , not a relationship that &apos;s based on the traditional sort of donor beneficiary weirdness that can happen .
But instead a relationship that can promote respect and hope and this optimism that together we can move forward .
So what I hope is that , not only can the money keep flowing forth through Kiva — that &apos;s a very positive and meaningful thing — but I hope Kiva can blur those lines , like I said , between the traditional rich and poor categories that we &apos;re taught to see in the world , this false dichotomy of us and them , have and have not .
I hope that Kiva can blur those lines .
Because as that happens , I think we can feel free to interact in a way that &apos;s more open , more just and more creative , to engage with each other and to help each other .
Imagine how you feel when you see somebody on street who is begging and you &apos;re about to approach them .
Imagine how you feel ; and then imagine the difference when you might see somebody who has a story of entrepreneurship and hard work who wants to tell you about their business .
Maybe they &apos;re smiling , and they want to talk to you about what they &apos;ve done .
Imagine if you &apos;re speaking with somebody who &apos;s growing things and making them flourish , somebody who &apos;s using their talents to do something productive , somebody who &apos;s built their own business from scratch , someone who is surrounded by abundance , not scarcity , who &apos;s in fact creating abundance , somebody with full hands with something to offer , not empty hands asking for you to give them something .
Imagine if you could hear a story you didn &apos;t expect of somebody who wakes up every day and works very , very hard to make their life better .
These stories can really change the way that we think about each other .
And if we can catalyze a supportive community to come around these individuals and to participate in their story by lending a little bit of money , I think that can change the way we believe in each other and each other &apos;s potential .
Now for me , Kiva is just the beginning .
And as I look forward to what is next , it &apos;s been helpful to reflect on the things I &apos;ve learned so far .
The first one is , as I mentioned , entrepreneurship was a new idea to me .
Kiva borrowers , as I interviewed them and got to know them over the last few years , have taught me what entrepreneurship is .
And I think , at its core , it &apos;s deciding that you want your life to be better .
You see an opportunity and you decide what you &apos;re going to do to try to seize that .
In short , it &apos;s deciding that tomorrow can better than today and going after that .
Second thing that I &apos;ve learned is that loans are a very interesting tool for connectivity .
So they &apos;re not a donation .
Yeah , maybe it doesn &apos;t sound that much different .
But in fact , when you give something to someone and they say , &quot; &quot; Thanks , &quot; &quot; and let you know how things go , that &apos;s one thing .
When you lend them money , and they slowly pay you back over time , you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue .
This continued attention — this ongoing attention — is a really big deal to build different kinds of relationships among us .
And then third , from what I &apos;ve heard from the entrepreneurs I &apos;ve gotten to know , when all else is equal , given the option to have just money to do what you need to do , or money plus the support and encouragement of a global community , people choose the community plus the money .
That &apos;s a much more meaningful combination , a more powerful combination .
So with that in mind , this particular incident has led to the things that I &apos;m working on now .
I see entrepreneurs everywhere now , now that I &apos;m tuned into this .
And one thing that I &apos;ve seen is there are a lot of supportive communities that already exist in the world .
With social networks , it &apos;s an amazing way , growing the number of people that we all have around us in our own supportive communities , rapidly .
And so , as I have been thinking about this , I &apos;ve been wondering : how can we engage these supportive communities to catalyze even more entrepreneurial ideas and to catalyze all of us to make tomorrow better than today ?
As I &apos;ve researched what &apos;s going on in the United States , a few interesting little insights have come up .
So one is that , of course , as we all might expect , many small businesses in the U.S. and all over the world still need money to grow and to do more of what they want to do or they might need money during a hard month .
But there &apos;s always a need for resources close by .
Another thing is , it turns out , those resources don &apos;t usually come from the places you might expect — banks , venture capitalists , other organizations and support structures — they come from friends and family .
Some statistics say 85 percent or more of funding for small businesses comes from friends and family .
That &apos;s around 130 billion dollars a year — it &apos;s a lot .
And third , so as people are doing this friends and family fundraising process , it &apos;s very awkward , people don &apos;t know exactly what to ask for , how to ask , what to promise in return , even though they have the best of intentions and want to thank those people that are supporting them .
So to harness the power of these supportive communities in a new way and to allow entrepreneurs to decide for themselves exactly what that financial exchange should look like , exactly what fits them and the people around them , this week actually , we &apos;re quietly doing a launch of Profounder , which is a crowd funding platform for small businesses to raise what they need through investments from their friends and family .
And it &apos;s investments , not donations , not loans , but investments that have a dynamic return .
So the mapping of participating in the story , it actually flows with the up and down .
So in short , it &apos;s a do-it-yourself tool for small businesses to raise these funds .
And what you can do is go onto the site , create a profile , create investment terms in a really easy way .
We make it really , really simple for me as well as anyone else who wants to use the site .
And we allow entrepreneurs to share a percentage of their revenues .
They can raise up to a million dollars from an unlimited number of unaccredited , unsophisticated investors — everyday people , heaven forbid — and they can share those returns over time — again , whatever terms they set .
As investors choose to become involved based on those terms , they can either take their rewards back as cash , or they can decide in advance to give those returns away to a non-profit .
So they can be a cash , or a cause , investor .
It &apos;s my hope that this kind of tool can show anybody who has an idea a path to go do what they want to do in the world and to gather the people around them that they already have , the people that know them best and that love them and want to support them , to gather them to make this happen .
So that &apos;s what I &apos;m working on now .
And to close , I just want to say , look these are tools .
Right now , Profounder &apos;s right at the very beginning , and it &apos;s very palpable ; it &apos;s very clear to me , that it &apos;s just a vessel , it &apos;s just a tool .
What we need are for people to care , to actually go use it , just like they &apos;ve cared enough to use Kiva to make those connections .
But the good news is I don &apos;t think I need to stand here and convince you to care — I &apos;m not even going to try .
I don &apos;t think , even though we often hear , you know , hear the ethical and moral reasons , the religious reasons , &quot; Here &apos;s why caring and giving will make you happier . &quot;
I don &apos;t think we need to be convinced of that . I think we know ; in fact , I think we know so much , and it &apos;s such a reality that we care so deeply , that in fact , what usually stops us is that we &apos;re afraid to try and to mess up , because we care so very much about helping each other and being meaningful in each other &apos;s lives .
So what I think I can do today , that best thing I can give you — I &apos;ve given you my story , which is the best I can do .
And I think I can remind us that we do care .
I think we all already know that .
And I think we know that love is resilient enough for us to get out there and try .
Just a sec .
( Applause ) Thanks . ( Applause ) Thanks . ( Applause )
For me , the best way to be inspired to try
is to stop and to listen to someone else &apos;s story .
And I &apos;m grateful that I &apos;ve gotten to do that here at TED .
And I &apos;m grateful that whenever I do that , guaranteed , I am inspired — I am inspired by the person I am listening to .
And I believe more and more every time I listen in that that person &apos;s potential to do great things in the world and in my own potential to maybe help .
And that — forget the tools , forget the moving around of resources — that stuff &apos;s easy .
Believing in each other , really being sure when push comes to shove that each one of us can do amazing things in the world , that is what can make our stories into love stories and our collective story into one that continually perpetuates hope and good things for all of us .
So that , this belief in each other , knowing that without a doubt and practicing that every day in whatever you do , that &apos;s what I believe will change the world and make tomorrow better than today .
Thank you .

Let me begin with four words that will provide the context for this week , four words that will come to define this century .
Here they are : The Earth is full .
It &apos;s full of us , it &apos;s full of our stuff , full of our waste , full of our demands .
Yes , we are a brilliant and creative species , but we &apos;ve created a little too much stuff — so much that our economy is now bigger than its host , our planet .
This is not a philosophical statement , this is just science based in physics , chemistry and biology .
There are many science-based analyses of this , but they all draw the same conclusion — that we &apos;re living beyond our means .
The eminent scientists of the Global Footprint Network , for example , calculate that we need about 1.5 Earths to sustain this economy .
In other words , to keep operating at our current level , we need 50 percent more Earth than we &apos;ve got .
In financial terms , this would be like always spending 50 percent more than you earn , going further into debt every year .
But of course , you can &apos;t borrow natural resources , so we &apos;re burning through our capital , or stealing from the future .
So when I say full , I mean really full — well past any margin for error , well past any dispute about methodology .
What this means is our economy is unsustainable .
I &apos;m not saying it &apos;s not nice or pleasant or that it &apos;s bad for polar bears or forests , though it certainly is .
What I &apos;m saying is our approach is simply unsustainable .
In other words , thanks to those pesky laws of physics , when things aren &apos;t sustainable , they stop .
But that &apos;s not possible , you might think .
We can &apos;t stop economic growth .
Because that &apos;s what will stop : economic growth .
It will stop because of the end of trade resources .
It will stop because of the growing demand of us on all the resources , all the capacity , all the systems of the Earth , which is now having economic damage .
When we think about economic growth stopping , we go , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s not possible , &quot; &quot; because economic growth is so essential to our society that is is rarely questioned .
Although growth has certainly delivered many benefits , it is an idea so essential that we tend not to understand the possibility of it not being around .
Even though it has delivered many benefits , it is based on a crazy idea — the crazy idea being that we can have infinite growth on a finite planet .
And I &apos;m here to tell you the emperor has no clothes .
That the crazy idea is just that , it is crazy , and with the Earth full , it &apos;s game over .
Come on , you &apos;re thinking .
That &apos;s not possible .
Technology is amazing . People are innovative .
There are so many ways we can improve the way we do things .
We can surely sort this out .
That &apos;s all true .
Well , it &apos;s mostly true .
We are certainly amazing , and we regularly solve complex problems with amazing creativity .
So if our problem was to get the human economy down from 150 percent to 100 percent of the Earth &apos;s capacity , we could do that .
The problem is we &apos;re just warming up this growth engine .
We plan to take this highly-stressed economy and make it twice as big and then make it four times as big — not in some distant future , but in less than 40 years , in the life time of most of you .
China plans to be there in just 20 years .
The only problem with this plan is that it &apos;s not possible .
In response , some people argue , but we need growth , we need it to solve poverty .
We need it to develop technology .
We need it to keep social stability .
I find this argument fascinating , as though we can kind of bend the rules of physics to suit our needs .
It &apos;s like the Earth doesn &apos;t care what we need .
Mother nature doesn &apos;t negotiate ; she just sets rules and describes consequences .
And these are not esoteric limits .
This is about food and water , soil and climate , the basic practical and economic foundations of our lives .
So the idea that we can smoothly transition to a highly-efficient , solar-powered , knowledge-based economy transformed by science and technology so that nine billion people can live in 2050 a life of abundance and digital downloads is a delusion .
It &apos;s not that it &apos;s not possible to feed , clothe and house us all and have us live decent lives .
It certainly is .
But the idea that we can gently grow there with a few minor hiccups is just wrong , and it &apos;s dangerously wrong , because it means we &apos;re not getting ready for what &apos;s really going to happen .
See what happens when you operate a system past its limits and then keep on going at an ever-accelerating rate is that the system stops working and breaks down .
And that &apos;s what will happen to us .
Many of you will be thinking , but surely we can still stop this .
If it &apos;s that bad , we &apos;ll react .
Let &apos;s just think through that idea .
Now we &apos;ve had 50 years of warnings .
We &apos;ve had science proving the urgency of change .
We &apos;ve had economic analysis pointing out that , not only can we afford it , it &apos;s cheaper to act early .
And yet , the reality is we &apos;ve done pretty much nothing to change course .
We &apos;re not even slowing down .
Last year on climate , for example , we had the highest global emissions ever .
The story on food , on water , on soil , on climate is all much the same .
I actually don &apos;t say this in despair .
I &apos;ve done my grieving about the loss .
I accept where we are .
It is sad , but it is what it is .
But it is also time that we ended our denial and recognized that we &apos;re not acting , we &apos;re not close to acting and we &apos;re not going to act until this crisis hits the economy .
And that &apos;s why the end of growth is the central issue and the event that we need to get ready for .
So when does this transition begin ?
When does this breakdown begin ?
In my view , it is well underway .
I know most people don &apos;t see it that way .
We tend to look at the world , not as the integrated system that it is , but as a series of individual issues .
We see the Occupy protests , we see spiraling debt crises , we see growing inequality , we see money &apos;s influence on politics , we see resource constraint , food and oil prices .
But we see , mistakenly , each of these issues as individual problems to be solved .
In fact , it &apos;s the system in the painful process of breaking down — our system , of debt-fueled economic growth , of ineffective democracy , of overloading planet Earth , is eating itself alive .
I could give you countless studies and evidence to prove this , but I won &apos;t because , if you want to see it , that evidence is all around you .
I want to talk to you about fear .
I want to do so because , in my view , the most important issue we face is how we respond to this question .
The crisis is now inevitable .
This issue is , how will we react ?
Of course , we can &apos;t know what will happen .
The future is inherently uncertain .
But let &apos;s just think through what the science is telling us is likely to happen .
Imagine our economy when the carbon bubble bursts , when the financial markets recognize that , to have any hope of preventing the climate spiraling out of control , the oil and coal industries are finished .
Imagine China , India and Pakistan going to war as climate impacts generate conflict over food and water .
Imagine the Middle East without oil income , but with collapsing governments .
Imagine our highly-tuned , just-in-time food industry and our highly-stressed agricultural system failing and supermarket shelves emptying .
Imagine 30 percent unemployment in America as the global economy is gripped by fear and uncertainty .
Now imagine what that means for you , your family , your friends , your personal financial security .
Imagine what it means for your personal security as a heavily armed civilian population gets angrier and angrier about why this was allowed to happen .
Imagine what you &apos;ll tell your children when they ask you , &quot; &quot; So , in 2012 , Mom and Dad , what was it like when you &apos;d had the hottest decade on record for the third decade in a row , when every scientific body in the world was saying you &apos;ve got a major problem , when the oceans were acidifying , when oil and food prices were spiking , when they were rioting in the streets of London and occupying Wall Street ?
When the system was so clearly breaking down , Mom and Dad , what did you do , what were you thinking ? &quot; &quot; So how do you feel when the lights go out on the global economy in your mind , when your assumptions about the future fade away and something very different emerges ?
Just take a moment and take a breath and think , what do you feel at this point ?
Perhaps denial .
Perhaps anger .
Maybe fear .
Of course , we can &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen and we have to live with uncertainty .
But when we think about the kind of possibilities I paint , we should feel a bit of fear .
We are in danger , all of us , and we &apos;ve evolved to respond to danger with fear to motivate a powerful response , to help us bravely face a threat .
But this time it &apos;s not a tiger at the cave mouth .
You can &apos;t see the danger at your door .
But if you look , you can see it at the door of your civilization .
That &apos;s why we need to feel our response now while the lights are still on , because if we wait until the crisis takes hold , we may panic and hide .
If we feel it now and think it through , we will realize we have nothing to fear but fear itself .
Yes , things will get ugly , and it will happen soon — certainly in our lifetime — but we are more than capable of getting through everything that &apos;s coming .
You see , those people that have faith that humans can solve any problem , that technology is limitless , that markets can be a force for good , are in fact right .
The only thing they &apos;re missing is that it takes a good crisis to get us going .
When we feel fear and we fear loss we are capable of quite extraordinary things .
Think about war .
After the bombing of Pearl Harbor , it just took four days for the government to ban the production of civilian cars and to redirect the auto industry , and from there to rationing of food and energy .
Think about how a company responds to a bankruptcy threat and how a change that seemed impossible just gets done .
Think about how an individual responds to a diagnosis of a life-threatening illness and how lifestyle changes that previously were just too difficult suddenly become relatively easy .
We are smart , in fact , we really are quite amazing , but we do love a good crisis .
And the good news , this one &apos;s a monster .
( Laughter ) Sure , if we get it wrong , we could face the end of this civilization , but if we get it right , it could be the beginning of civilization instead .
And how cool would it be to tell your grandchildren that you were part of that ?
There &apos;s certainly no technical or economic barrier in the way .
Scientists like James Hansen tell us we may need to eliminate net CO2 emissions from the economy in just a few decades .
I wanted to know what that would take , so I worked with professor Jorgen Randers from Norway to find the answer .
We developed a plan called &quot; &quot; The One Degree War Plan &quot; &quot; — so named because of the level of mobilization and focus required .
To my surprise , eliminating net CO2 emissions from the economy in just 20 years is actually pretty easy and pretty cheap , not very cheap , but certainly less than the cost of a collapsing civilization .
We didn &apos;t calculate that precisely , but we understand that &apos;s very expensive .
You can read the details , but in summary , we can transform our economy .
We can do it with proven technology .
We can do it at an affordable cost .
We can do it with existing political structures .
The only thing we need to change is how we think and how we feel .
And this is where you come in .
When we think about the future I paint , of course we should feel a bit of fear .
But fear can be paralyzing or motivating .
We need to accept the fear and then we need to act .
We need to act like the future depends on it .
We need to act like we only have one planet .
We can do this .
I know the free market fundamentalists will tell you that more growth , more stuff and nine billion people going shopping is the best we can do .
They &apos;re wrong .
We can be more , we can be much more .
We have achieved remarkable things since working out how to grow food some 10,000 years ago .
We &apos;ve built a powerful foundation of science , knowledge and technology — more than enough to build a society where nine billion people can lead decent , meaningful and satisfying lives .
The Earth can support that if we choose the right path .
We can choose this moment of crisis to ask and answer the big questions of society &apos;s evolution — like , what do we want to be when we grow up , when we move past this bumbling adolescence where we think there are no limits and suffer delusions of immortality ?
Well it &apos;s time to grow up , to be wiser , to be calmer , to be more considered .
Like generations before us , we &apos;ll be growing up in war — not a war between civilizations , but a war for civilization , for the extraordinary opportunity to build a society which is stronger and happier and plans on staying around into middle age .
We can choose life over fear .
We can do what we need to do , but it will take every entrepreneur , every artist , every scientist , every communicator , every mother , every father , every child , every one of us .
This could be our finest hour .
Thank you .

Over the past 10 years , I &apos;ve been researching the way people organize and visualize information .
And I &apos;ve noticed an interesting shift .
For a long period of time , we believed in a natural ranking order in the world around us , also known as the great chain of being , or &quot; &quot; Scala naturae &quot; &quot; in Latin , a top-down structure that normally starts with God at the very top , followed by angels , noblemen , common people , animals , and so on .
This idea was actually based on Aristotle &apos;s ontology , which classified all things known to man in a set of opposing categories , like the ones you see behind me .
But over time , interestingly enough , this concept adopted the branching schema of a tree in what became known as the Porphyrian tree , also considered to be the oldest tree of knowledge .
The branching scheme of the tree was , in fact , such a powerful metaphor for conveying information that it became , over time , an important communication tool to map a variety of systems of knowledge .
We can see trees being used to map morality , with the popular tree of virtues and tree of vices , as you can see here , with these beautiful illustrations from medieval Europe .
We can see trees being used to map consanguinity , the various blood ties between people .
I think many of you in the audience have probably seen family trees .
Many of you probably even have your own family trees drawn in such a way .
We can see trees even mapping systems of law , the various decrees and rulings of kings and rulers .
And finally , of course , also a very popular scientific metaphor , we can see trees being used to map all species known to man .
And trees ultimately became such a powerful visual metaphor because in many ways , they really embody this human desire for order , for balance , for unity , for symmetry .
However , nowadays we are really facing new complex , intricate challenges that cannot be understood by simply employing a simple tree diagram .
And a new metaphor is currently emerging , and it &apos;s currently replacing the tree in visualizing various systems of knowledge .
It &apos;s really providing us with a new lens to understand the world around us .
And this new metaphor is the metaphor of the network .
And we can see this shift from trees into networks in many domains of knowledge .
We can see this shift in the way we try to understand the brain .
While before , we used to think of the brain as a modular , centralized organ , where a given area was responsible for a set of actions and behaviors , the more we know about the brain , the more we think of it as a large music symphony , played by hundreds and thousands of instruments .
This is a beautiful snapshot created by the Blue Brain Project , where you can see 10,000 neurons and 30 million connections .
And this is only mapping 10 percent of a mammalian neocortex .
We can also see this shift in the way we try to conceive of human knowledge .
These are some remarkable trees of knowledge , or trees of science , by Spanish scholar Ramon Llull .
Interestingly , I asked this question when I was a little kid .
Some got killed , and some did it without drug assistance .
And then the next step is another 15 volts .
They said only one percent .
Milgram did more than 16 studies .
And it happens when you &apos;re in a new or unfamiliar situation .
A white guy falls on the tracks .
Take path one , you &apos;re going to be a perpetrator of evil .
You &apos;re going to cheat , or you &apos;re going to allow bullying .
If you go on the TED website , you can currently find there over a full week of TEDTalk videos , over 1.3 million words of transcripts and millions of user ratings .
And that &apos;s a huge amount of data .
And it got me wondering : If you took all this data and put it through statistical analysis , could you reverse engineer a TEDTalk ?
Could you create the ultimate TEDTalk ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And also , could you create the worst possible TEDTalk that they would still let you get away with ?
To find this out , I looked at three things : I looked at the topic that you should choose , I looked at how you should deliver it and the visuals onstage .
Now , with the topic : There &apos;s a whole range of topics you can choose , but you should choose wisely , because your topic strongly correlates with how users will react to your talk .
Now , to make this more concrete , let &apos;s look at the list of top 10 words that statistically stick out in the most favorite TEDTalks and in the least favorite TEDTalks .
So if you came here to talk about how French coffee will spread happiness in our brains , that &apos;s a go .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Whereas , if you wanted to talk about your project involving oxygen , girls , aircraft — actually , I would like to hear that talk , ( Laughter ) but statistics say it &apos;s not so good .
Oh , well .
If you generalize this , the most favorite TEDTalks are those that feature topics we can connect with , both easily and deeply , such as happiness , our own body , food , emotions .
And the more technical topics , such as architecture , materials and , strangely enough , men , those are not good topics to talk about .
How should you deliver your talk ?
TED is famous for keeping a very sharp eye on the clock , so they &apos;re going to hate me for revealing this , because , actually , you should talk as long as they will let you . ( Laughter ) Because the most favorite TEDTalks are , on average , over 50 percent longer than the least favorite ones .
And this holds true for all ranking lists on TED.com except if you want to have a talk that &apos;s beautiful , inspiring or funny .
Then , you should be brief . ( Laughter ) But other than that , talk until they drag you off the stage . ( Laughter )
Now , while ...
( Applause ) While you &apos;re pushing the clock , there &apos;s a few rules to obey .
I found these rules out by comparing the statistics of four-word phrases that appear more often in the most favorite TEDTalks as opposed to the least favorite TEDTalks .
I &apos;ll give you three examples .
First of all , I must , as a speaker , provide a service to the audience and talk about what I will give you , instead of saying what I can &apos;t have .
Secondly , it &apos;s imperative that you do not cite The New York Times .
( Laughter ) And finally , it &apos;s okay for the speaker — that &apos;s the good news — to fake intellectual capacity .
If I don &apos;t understand something , I can just say , &quot; &quot; etc . , etc . &quot; &quot; You &apos;ll all stay with me .
It &apos;s perfectly fine .
( Applause ) Now , let &apos;s go to the visuals .
The most obvious visual thing on stage is the speaker .
And analysis shows if you want to be among the most favorite TED speakers , you should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average , make sure you wear your glasses and be slightly more dressed-up than the average TED speaker .
Slides are okay , though you might consider going for props .
And now the most important thing , that is the mood onstage .
Color plays a very important role .
Color closely correlates with the ratings that talks get on the website .
( Applause ) For example , fascinating talks contain a statistically high amount of exactly this blue color , ( Laughter ) much more than the average TEDTalk .
Ingenious TEDTalks , much more this green color , etc . , et .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Now , personally , I think I &apos;m not the first one who has done this analysis , but I &apos;ll leave this to your good judgment .
So , now it &apos;s time to put it all together and design the ultimate TEDTalk .
Now , since this is TEDActive , and I learned from my analysis that I should actually give you something , I will not impose the ultimate or worst TEDTalk on you , but rather give you a tool to create your own .
And I call this tool the TEDPad .
( Laughter ) And the TEDPad is a matrix of 100 specifically selected , highly curated sentences that you can easily piece together to get your own TEDTalk .
You only have to make one decision , and that is : Are you going to use the white version for very good TEDTalks , about creativity , human genius ?
Or are you going to go with a black version , which will allow you to create really bad TEDTalks , mostly about blogs , politics and stuff ?
So , download it and have fun with it .
Now I hope you enjoy the session .
I hope you enjoy designing your own ultimate and worst possible TEDTalks .
And I hope some of you will be inspired for next year to create this , which I really want to see .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thanks .
And I would have lost my face .
( Applause ) And I try to live my dream — well , actually , it was never my dream , but it sounds so good .
And I want to first rehearse with you your whistling .
This is my first trip , my first foreign trip as a first lady .
Can you believe that ?
( Applause ) And while this is not my first visit to the U.K. , I have to say that I am glad that this is my first official visit .
The special relationship between the United States and the U.K.
is based not only on the relationship between governments , but the common language and the values that we share , and I &apos;m reminded of that by watching you all today .
During my visit I &apos;ve been especially honored to meet some of Britain &apos;s most extraordinary women — women who are paving the way for all of you .
And I &apos;m honored to meet you , the future leaders of Great Britain and this world .
And although the circumstances of our lives may seem very distant , with me standing here as the First Lady of the United States of America , and you , just getting through school , I want you to know that we have very much in common .
For nothing in my life &apos;s path would have predicted that I &apos;d be standing here as the first African-American First Lady of the United States of America .
There is nothing in my story that would land me here .
I wasn &apos;t raised with wealth or resources or any social standing to speak of .
I was raised on the South Side of Chicago .
That &apos;s the real part of Chicago .
And I was the product of a working-class community .
My father was a city worker all of his life , and my mother was a stay-at-home mom .
And she stayed at home to take care of me and my older brother .
Neither of them attended university .
My dad was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in the prime of his life .
But even as it got harder for him to walk and get dressed in the morning — I saw him struggle more and more — my father never complained about his struggle .
He was grateful for what he had .
He just woke up a little earlier and worked a little harder .
And my brother and I were raised with all that you really need : love , strong values and a belief that with a good education and a whole lot of hard work , that there was nothing that we could not do .
I am an example of what &apos;s possible when girls from the very beginning of their lives are loved and nurtured by the people around them .
I was surrounded by extraordinary women in my life : grandmothers , teachers , aunts , cousins , neighbors , who taught me about quiet strength and dignity .
And my mother , the most important role model in my life , who lives with us at the White House and helps to care for our two little daughters , Malia and Sasha .
She &apos;s an active presence in their lives , as well as mine , and is instilling in them the same values that she taught me and my brother : things like compassion , and integrity , and confidence , and perseverance — all of that wrapped up in an unconditional love that only a grandmother can give .
I was also fortunate enough to be cherished and encouraged by some strong male role models as well , including my father , my brother , uncles and grandfathers .
The men in my life taught me some important things , as well .
They taught me about what a respectful relationship should look like between men and women .
They taught me about what a strong marriage feels like : that it &apos;s built on faith and commitment and an admiration for each other &apos;s unique gifts .
They taught me about what it means to be a father and to raise a family .
And not only to invest in your own home but to reach out and help raise kids in the broader community .
And these were the same qualities that I looked for in my own husband , Barack Obama .
And when we first met , one of the things that I remember is that he took me out on a date .
And his date was to go with him to a community meeting .
( Laughter ) I know , how romantic . ( Laughter )
But when we met , Barack was a community organizer .
He worked , helping people to find jobs and to try to bring resources into struggling neighborhoods .
As he talked to the residents in that community center , he talked about two concepts .
He talked about &quot; &quot; the world as it is &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; the world as it should be . &quot; &quot; And I talked about this throughout the entire campaign .
What he said , that all too often , is that we accept the distance between those two ideas .
And sometimes we settle for the world as it is , even when it doesn &apos;t reflect our values and aspirations .
But Barack reminded us on that day , all of us in that room , that we all know what our world should look like .
We know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like .
We all know .
And he urged the people in that meeting , in that community , to devote themselves to closing the gap between those two ideas , to work together to try to make the world as it is and the world as it should be , one and the same .
And I think about that today because I am reminded and convinced that all of you in this school are very important parts of closing that gap .
You are the women who will build the world as it should be .
You &apos;re going to write the next chapter in history .
Not just for yourselves , but for your generation and generations to come .
And that &apos;s why getting a good education is so important .
That &apos;s why all of this that you &apos;re going through — the ups and the downs , the teachers that you love and the teachers that you don &apos;t — why it &apos;s so important .
Because communities and countries and ultimately the world are only as strong as the health of their women .
And that &apos;s important to keep in mind .
Part of that health includes an outstanding education .
The difference between a struggling family and a healthy one is often the presence of an empowered woman or women at the center of that family .
The difference between a broken community and a thriving one is often the healthy respect between men and women who appreciate the contributions each other makes to society .
The difference between a languishing nation and one that will flourish is the recognition that we need equal access to education for both boys and girls .
And this school , named after the U.K. &apos; s first female doctor , and the surrounding buildings named for Mexican artist Frida Kahlo , Mary Seacole , the Jamaican nurse known as the &quot; &quot; black Florence Nightingale , &quot; &quot; and the English author , Emily Bronte , honor women who fought sexism , racism and ignorance , to pursue their passions to feed their own souls .
They allowed for no obstacles .
As the sign said back there , &quot; &quot; without limitations . &quot; &quot; They knew no other way to live than to follow their dreams .
And having done so , these women moved many obstacles .
And they opened many new doors for millions of female doctors and nurses and artists and authors , all of whom have followed them .
And by getting a good education , you too can control your own destiny .
Please remember that .
If you want to know the reason why I &apos;m standing here , it &apos;s because of education .
I never cut class . Sorry , I don &apos;t know if anybody is cutting class .
I never did it .
I loved getting As .
I liked being smart .
I liked being on time . I liked getting my work done .
I thought being smart was cooler than anything in the world .
And you too , with these same values , can control your own destiny .
You too can pave the way .
You too can realize your dreams , and then your job is to reach back and to help someone just like you do the same thing .
History proves that it doesn &apos;t matter whether you come from a council estate or a country estate .
Your success will be determined by your own fortitude , your own confidence , your own individual hard work .
That is true . That is the reality of the world that we live in .
You now have control over your own destiny .
And it won &apos;t be easy — that &apos;s for sure .
But you have everything you need .
Everything you need to succeed , you already have , right here .
My husband works in this big office .
They call it the Oval Office .
In the White House , there &apos;s the desk that he sits at — it &apos;s called the Resolute desk .
It was built by the timber of Her Majesty &apos;s Ship Resolute and given by Queen Victoria .
It &apos;s an enduring symbol of the friendship between our two nations .
And its name , Resolute , is a reminder of the strength of character that &apos;s required not only to lead a country , but to live a life of purpose , as well .
And I hope in pursuing your dreams , you all remain resolute , that you go forward without limits , and that you use your talents — because there are many ; we &apos;ve seen them ; it &apos;s there — that you use them to create the world as it should be .
Because we are counting on you .
We are counting on every single one of you to be the very best that you can be .
Because the world is big .
And it &apos;s full of challenges .
And we need strong , smart , confident young women to stand up and take the reins .
We know you can do it . We love you . Thank you so much .

Okay , I &apos;m going to show you again something about our diets .
And I would like to know what the audience is , and so who of you ever ate insects ?
That &apos;s quite a lot .
( Laughter ) But still , you &apos;re not representing the overall population of the Earth . ( Laughter )
Because there &apos;s 80 percent out there that really eats insects .
But this is quite good .
Why not eat insects ? Well first , what are insects ?
Insects are animals that walk around on six legs .
And here you see just a selection .
There &apos;s six million species of insects on this planet , six million species .
There &apos;s a few hundreds of mammals — six million species of insects .
In fact , if we count all the individual organisms , we would come at much larger numbers .
In fact , of all animals on Earth , of all animal species , 80 percent walks on six legs .
But if we would count all the individuals , and we take an average weight of them , it would amount to something like 200 to 2,000 kilograms for each of you and me on Earth .
That means that in terms of biomass , insects are more abundant than we are , and we &apos;re not on a planet of men , but we &apos;re on a planet of insects .
Insects are not only there in nature , but they also are involved in our economy , usually without us knowing .
There was an estimation , a conservative estimation , a couple of years ago that the U.S. economy benefited by 57 billion dollars per year .
It &apos;s a number — very large — a contribution to the economy of the United States for free .
And so I looked up what the economy was paying for the war in Iraq in the same year .
It was 80 billion U.S. dollars .
Well we know that that was not a cheap war .
So insects , just for free , contribute to the economy of the United States with about the same order of magnitude , just for free , without everyone knowing .
And not only in the States , but in any country , in any economy .
What do they do ?
They remove dung , they pollinate our crops .
A third of all the fruits that we eat are all a result of insects taking care of the reproduction of plants .
They control pests , and they &apos;re food for animals .
They &apos;re at the start of food chains .
Small animals eat insects .
Even larger animals eat insects .
But the small animals that eat insects are being eaten by larger animals , still larger animals .
And at the end of the food chain , we are eating them as well .
There &apos;s quite a lot of people that are eating insects .
And here you see me in a small , provincial town in China , Lijiang — about two million inhabitants .
If you go out for dinner , like in a fish restaurant , where you can select which fish you want to eat , you can select which insects you would like to eat .
And they prepare it in a wonderful way .
And here you see me enjoying a meal with caterpillars , locusts , bee pupae — delicacies .
And you can eat something new everyday .
There &apos;s more than 1,000 species of insects that are being eaten all around the globe .
That &apos;s quite a bit more than just a few mammals that we &apos;re eating , like a cow or a pig or a sheep .
More than 1,000 species — an enormous variety .
And now you may think , okay , in this provincial town in China they &apos;re doing that , but not us .
Well we &apos;ve seen already that quite some of you already ate insects maybe occasionally , but I can tell you that every one of you is eating insects , without any exception .
You &apos;re eating at least 500 grams per year .
What are you eating ?
Tomato soup , peanut butter , chocolate , noodles — any processed food that you &apos;re eating contains insects , because insects are here all around us , and when they &apos;re out there in nature they &apos;re also in our crops .
Some fruits get some insect damage .
Those are the fruits , if they &apos;re tomato , that go to the tomato soup .
If they don &apos;t have any damage , they go to the grocery .
And that &apos;s your view of a tomato .
But there &apos;s tomatoes that end up in a soup , and as long as they meet the requirements of the food agency , there can be all kinds of things in there , no problem .
In fact , why would we put these balls in the soup , there &apos;s meat in there anyway ?
( Laughter ) In fact , all our processed foods contain more proteins than we would be aware of .
So anything is a good protein source already .
Now you may say , &quot; Okay , so we &apos;re eating 500 grams just by accident . &quot;
We &apos;re even doing this on purpose .
In a lot of food items that we have — I have only two items here on the slide — pink cookies or surimi sticks or , if you like , Campari — a lot of our food products that are of a red color are dyed with a natural dye .
The surimi sticks &#91; of &#93; crabmeat , or is being sold as crab meat , is white fish that &apos;s being dyed with cochineal .
Cochineal is a product of an insect that lives off these cacti .
It &apos;s being produced in large amounts , 150 to 180 metric tons per year in the Canary Islands in Peru , and it &apos;s big business .
One gram of cochineal costs about 30 euros .
One gram of gold is 30 euros .
So it &apos;s a very precious thing that we &apos;re using to dye our foods .
Now the situation in the world is going to change for you and me , for everyone on this Earth .
The human population is growing very rapidly and is growing exponentially .
Where , at the moment , we have something between six and seven billion people , it will grow to about nine billion in 2050 .
That means that we have a lot more mouths to feed , and this is something that worries more and more people .
There was an FAO conference last October that was completely devoted to this .
How are we going to feed this world ?
And if you look at the figures up there , it says that we have a third more mouths to feed , but we need an agricultural production increase of 70 percent .
And that &apos;s especially because this world population is increasing , and it &apos;s increasing , not only in numbers , but we &apos;re also getting wealthier , and anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more and also starts to eat more meat .
And meat , in fact , is something that costs a lot of our agricultural production .
Our diet consists , &#91; in &#93; some part , of animal proteins , and at the moment , most of us here get it from livestock , from fish , from game .
And we eat quite a lot of it .
In the developed world it &apos;s on average 80 kilograms per person per year , which goes up to 120 in the United States and a bit lower in some other countries , but on average 80 kilograms per person per year .
In the developing world it &apos;s much lower .
It &apos;s 25 kilograms per person per year .
But it &apos;s increasing enormously .
In China in the last 20 years , it increased from 20 to 50 , and it &apos;s still increasing .
So if a third of the world population is going to increase its meat consumption from 25 to 80 on average , and a third of the world population is living in China and in India , we &apos;re having an enormous demand on meat .
And of course , we are not there to say that &apos;s only for us , it &apos;s not for them .
They have the same share that we have .
Now to start with , I should say that we are eating way too much meat in the Western world .
We could do with much , much less — and I know , I &apos;ve been a vegetarian for a long time , and you can easily do without anything .
You &apos;ll get proteins in any kind of food anyway .
But then there &apos;s a lot of problems that come with meat production , and we &apos;re being faced with that more and more often .
The first problem that we &apos;re facing is human health .
Pigs are quite like us .
They &apos;re even models in medicine , and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human .
That means that pigs also share diseases with us .
And a pig disease , a pig virus , and a human virus can both proliferate , and because of their kind of reproduction , they can combine and produce a new virus .
This has happened in the Netherlands in the 1990s during the classical swine fever outbreak .
You get a new disease that can be deadly .
We eat insects — they &apos;re so distantly related from us that this doesn &apos;t happen .
So that &apos;s one point for insects .
( Laughter ) And there &apos;s the conversion factor .
You take 10 kilograms of feed , you can get one kilogram of beef , but you can get nine kilograms of locust meat .
So if you would be an entrepreneur , what would you do ?
With 10 kilograms of input , you can get either one or nine kg. of output .
So far we &apos;re taking the one , or up to five kilograms of output .
We &apos;re not taking the bonus yet .
We &apos;re not taking the nine kilograms of output yet .
So that &apos;s two points for insects .
( Laughter ) And there &apos;s the environment .
If we take 10 kilograms of food — ( Laughter ) and it results in one kilogram of beef , the other nine kilograms are waste , and a lot of that is manure .
If you produce insects , you have less manure per kilogram of meat that you produce .
So less waste .
Furthermore , per kilogram of manure , you have much , much less ammonia and fewer greenhouse gases when you have insect manure than when you have cow manure .
So you have less waste , and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign as it is with cow dung .
So that &apos;s three points for insects .
( Laughter ) Now there &apos;s a big &quot; &quot; if , &quot; &quot; of course , and it is if insects produce meat that is of good quality .
Well there have been all kinds of analyses and in terms of protein , or fat , or vitamins , it &apos;s very good .
In fact , it &apos;s comparable to anything we eat as meat at the moment .
And even in terms of calories , it is very good .
One kilogram of grasshoppers has the same amount of calories as 10 hot dogs , or six Big Macs .
So that &apos;s four points for insects .
( Laughter ) I can go on , and I could make many more points for insects , but time doesn &apos;t allow this .
So the question is , why not eat insects ?
I gave you at least four arguments in favor .
We &apos;ll have to .
Even if you don &apos;t like it , you &apos;ll have to get used to this because at the moment , 70 percent of all our agricultural land is being used to produce livestock .
That &apos;s not only the land where the livestock is walking and feeding , but it &apos;s also other areas where the feed is being produced and being transported .
We can increase it a bit at the expense of rainforests , but there &apos;s a limitation very soon .
And if you remember that we need to increase agricultural production by 70 percent , we &apos;re not going to make it that way .
We could much better change from meat , from beef , to insects .
And then 80 percent of the world already eats insects , so we are just a minority — in a country like the U.K. , the USA , the Netherlands , anywhere .
On the left-hand side , you see a market in Laos where they have abundantly present all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night .
On the right-hand side you see a grasshopper .
So people there are eating them , not because they &apos;re hungry , but because they think it &apos;s a delicacy .
It &apos;s just very good food .
You can vary enormously .
It has many benefits .
In fact , we have delicacy that &apos;s very much like this grasshopper : shrimps , a delicacy being sold at a high price .
Who wouldn &apos;t like to eat a shrimp ?
There are a few people who don &apos;t like shrimp , but shrimp , or crabs , or crayfish , are very closely related .
They are delicacies .
In fact , a locust is a &quot; &quot; shrimp &quot; &quot; of the land , and it would make very good into our diet .
So why are we not eating insects yet ?
Well that &apos;s just a matter of mindset .
We &apos;re not used to it , and we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us .
That &apos;s why we &apos;re changing the perception of insects .
And I &apos;m working very hard with my colleague , Arnold van Huis , in telling people what insects are , what magnificent things they are , what magnificent jobs they do in nature .
And in fact , without insects , we would not be here in this room , because if the insects die out , we will soon die out as well .
If we die out , the insects will continue very happily .
( Laughter ) So we have to get used to the idea of eating insects .
And some might think , well they &apos;re not yet available .
Well they are .
There are entrepreneurs in the Netherlands that produce them , and one of them is here in the audience , Marian Peeters , who &apos;s in the picture .
I predict that later this year , you &apos;ll get them in the supermarkets — not visible , but as animal protein in the food .
And maybe by 2020 , you &apos;ll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you &apos;re going to eat .
And they &apos;re being made in the most wonderful ways .
A Dutch chocolate maker .
( Music ) ( Applause ) So there &apos;s even a lot of design to it .
( Laughter ) Well in the Netherlands , we have an innovative Minister of Agriculture , and she puts the insects on the menu in her restaurant in her ministry .
And when she got all the Ministers of Agriculture of the E.U.
over to the Hague recently , she went to a high-class restaurant , and they ate insects all together .
It &apos;s not something that is a hobby of mine .
It &apos;s really taken off the ground .
So why not eat insects ?
You should try it yourself .
A couple of years ago , we had 1,750 people all together in a square in Wageningen town , and they ate insects at the same moment , and this was still big , big news .
I think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects , because it &apos;s just a normal way of doing .
So you can try it yourself today , and I would say , enjoy .
And I &apos;m going to show to Bruno some first tries , and he can have the first bite .
( Applause ) Bruno Giussani : Look at them first . Look at them first .
Marcel Dicke : It &apos;s all protein .
BG : That &apos;s exactly the same &#91; one &#93; you saw in the video actually .
And it looks delicious .
They just make it &#91; with &#93; nuts or something .
MD : Thank you .
( Applause )
Sometimes I go browsing &#91; through &#93; a very old magazine .
I found this observation test about the story of the ark .
And the artist that drew this observation test did some errors , had some mistakes — there are more or less 12 mistakes .
Some of them are very easy .
There is a funnel , an aerial part , a lamp and clockwork key on the ark .
Some of them are about the animals , the number .
But there is a much more fundamental mistake in the overall story of the ark that &apos;s not reported here .
And this problem is : where are the plants ?
So now we have God that is going to submerge Earth permanently or at least for a very long period , and no one is taking care of plants .
Noah needed to take two of every kind of bird , of every kind of animal , of every kind of creature that moves , but no mention about plants .
Why ?
In another part of the same story , all the living creatures are just the living creatures that came out from the ark , so birds , livestock and wild animals .
Plants are not living creatures — this is the point .
That is a point that is not coming out from the Bible , but it &apos;s something that really accompanied humanity .
Let &apos;s have a look at this nice code that is coming from a Renaissance book .
Here we have the description of the order of nature .
It &apos;s a nice description because it &apos;s starting from left — you have the stones — immediately after the stones , the plants that are just able to live .
We have the animals that are able to live and to sense , and on the top of the pyramid , there is the man .
This is not the common man .
The &quot; &quot; Homo studiosus &quot; &quot; — the studying man .
This is quite comforting for people like me — I &apos;m a professor — this to be over there on the top of creation .
But it &apos;s something completely wrong .
You know very well about professors .
But it &apos;s also wrong about plants , because plants are not just able to live ; they are able to sense .
They are much more sophisticated in sensing than animals .
Just to give you an example , every single root apex is able to detect and to monitor concurrently and continuously at least 15 different chemical and physical parameters .
And they also are able to show and to exhibit such a wonderful and complex behavior that can be described just with the term of intelligence .
Well , but this is something — this underestimation of plants is something that is always with us .
Let &apos;s have a look at this short movie now .
We have David Attenborough .
Now David Attenborough is really a plant lover ; he did some of the most beautiful movies about plant behavior .
Now , when he speaks about plants , everything is correct .
When he speaks about animals , &#91; he &#93; tends to remove the fact that plants exist .
The blue whale , the biggest creature that exists on the planet — that is wrong , completely wrong .
The blue whale , it &apos;s a dwarf if compared with the real biggest creature that exists on the planet — that is , this wonderful , magnificent Sequoiadendron giganteum .
( Applause ) And this is a living organism that has a mass of at least 2,000 tons .
Now , the story that plants are some low-level organisms has been formalized many times ago by Aristotle , that in &quot; &quot; De Anima &quot; &quot; — that is a very influential book for the Western civilization — wrote that the plants are on the edge between living and not living .
They have just a kind of very low-level soul .
It &apos;s called the vegetative soul , because they lack movement , and so they don &apos;t need to sense .
Let &apos;s see .
Okay , some of the movements of the plants are very well-known .
This is a very fast movement .
This is a Dionaea , a Venus fly trap hunting snails — sorry for the snail .
This has been something that has been refused for centuries , despite the evidence .
No one can say that the plants were able to eat an animal , because it was against the order of nature .
But plants are also able to show a lot of movement .
Some of them are very well known , like the flowering .
It &apos;s just a question to use some techniques like the time lapse .
Some of them are much more sophisticated .
Look at this young bean that is moving to catch the light every time .
And it &apos;s really so graceful ; it &apos;s like a dancing angel .
They are also able to play — they are really playing .
These are young sunflowers , and what they are doing cannot be described with any other terms than playing .
They are training themselves , as many young animals do , to the adult life where they will be called to track the sun all the day .
They are able to respond to gravity , of course , so the shoots are growing against the vector of gravity and the roots toward the vector of gravity .
But they are also able to sleep .
This is one , Mimosa pudica .
So during the night , they curl the leaves and reduce the movement , and during the day , you have the opening of the leaves — there is much more movement .
This is interesting because this sleeping machinery , it &apos;s perfectly conserved .
It &apos;s the same in plants , in insects and in animals .
And so if you need to study this sleeping problem , it &apos;s easy to study on plants , for example , than in animals and it &apos;s much more easy even ethically .
It &apos;s a kind of vegetarian experimentation .
Plants are even able to communicate — they are extraordinary communicators .
They communicate with other plants .
They are able to distinguish kin and non-kin .
They communicate with plants of other species and they communicate with animals by producing chemical volatiles , for example , during the pollination .
Now with the pollination , it &apos;s a very serious issue for plants , because they move the pollen from one flower to the other , yet they cannot move from one flower to the other .
So they need a vector — and this vector , it &apos;s normally an animal .
Many insects have been used by plants as vectors for the transport of the pollination , but not just insects ; even birds , reptiles , and mammals like bats rats are normally used for the transportation of the pollen .
This is a serious business .
We have the plants that are giving to the animals a kind of sweet substance — very energizing — having in change this transportation of the pollen .
But some plants are manipulating animals , like in the case of orchids that promise sex and nectar and give in change nothing for the transportation of the pollen .
Now , there is a big problem behind all this behavior that we have seen .
How is it possible to do this without a brain ?
We need to wait until 1880 , when this big man , Charles Darwin , publishes a wonderful , astonishing book that starts a revolution .
The title is &quot; &quot; The Power of Movement in Plants . &quot; &quot; No one was allowed to speak about movement in plants before Charles Darwin .
In his book , assisted by his son , Francis — who was the first professor of plant physiology in the world , in Cambridge — they took into consideration every single movement for 500 pages .
And in the last paragraph of the book , it &apos;s a kind of stylistic mark , because normally Charles Darwin stored , in the last paragraph of a book , the most important message .
He wrote that , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radical acts like the brain of one of the lower animals . &quot; &quot; This is not a metaphor .
He wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends who was J.D. Hooker , or at that time , president of the Royal Society , so the maximum scientific authority in Britain speaking about the brain in the plants .
Now , this is a root apex growing against a slope .
So you can recognize this kind of movement , the same movement that worms , snakes and every animal that are moving on the ground without legs is able to display .
And it &apos;s not an easy movement because , to have this kind of movement , you need to move different regions of the root and to synchronize these different regions without having a brain .
So we studied the root apex and we found that there is a specific region that is here , depicted in blue — that is called the &quot; &quot; transition zone . &quot; &quot; And this region , it &apos;s a very small region — it &apos;s less than one millimeter .
And in this small region you have the highest consumption of oxygen in the plants and more important , you have these kinds of signals here .
The signals that you are seeing here are action potential , are the same signals that the neurons of my brain , of our brain , use to exchange information .
Now we know that a root apex has just a few hundred cells that show this kind of feature , but we know how big the root apparatus of a small plant , like a plant of rye .
We have almost 14 million roots .
We have 11 and a half million root apex and a total length of 600 or more kilometers and a very high surface area .
Now let &apos;s imagine that each single root apex is working in network with all the others .
Here were have on the left , the Internet and on the right , the root apparatus .
They work in the same way .
They are a network of small computing machines , working in networks .
And why are they so similar ?
Because they evolved for the same reason : to survive predation .
They work in the same way .
So you can remove 90 percent of the root apparatus and the plants &#91; continue &#93; to work .
You can remove 90 percent of the Internet and it is &#91; continuing &#93; to work .
So , a suggestion for the people working with networks : plants are able to give you good suggestions about how to evolve networks .
And another possibility is a technological possibility .
Let &apos;s imagine that we can build robots and robots that are inspired by plants .
Until now , the man was inspired just by man or the animals in producing a robot .
We have the animaloid — and the normal robots inspired by animals , insectoid , so on .
We have the androids that are inspired by man .
But why have we not any plantoid ?
Well , if you want to fly , it &apos;s good that you look at birds — to be inspired by birds .
But if you want to explore soils , or if you want to colonize new territory , to best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants that are masters in doing this .
We have another possibility we are working &#91; on &#93; in our lab , &#91; which &#93; is to build hybrids .
It &apos;s much more easy to build hybrids .
Hybrid means it &apos;s something that &apos;s half living and half machine .
It &apos;s much more easy to work with plants than with animals .
They have computing power , they have electrical signals .
The connection with the machine is much more easy , much more even ethically possible .
And these are three possibilities that we are working on to build hybrids , driven by algae or by the leaves at the end , by the most , most powerful parts of the plants , by the roots .
Well , thank you for your attention .
And before I finish , I would like to reassure that no snails were harmed in making this presentation .
Thank you .
( Applause )
And that is that all of us want to be happy .
In this , we are all together .
How we imagine our happiness , that differs from one another , but it &apos;s already a lot that we have all in common , that we want to be happy .
Now my topic is gratefulness .
Many people would say , well , that &apos;s very easy .
When you are happy , you are grateful .
But think again .
And we all know people who have lots of misfortune , misfortune that we ourselves would not want to have , and they are deeply happy .
They radiate happiness . You are surprised .
Why ? Because they are grateful .
So it is not happiness that makes us grateful .
It &apos;s gratefulness that makes you happy .
Now , we can ask , what do we really mean by gratefulness ?
I appeal to your own experience .
We all know from experience how it goes .
We experience something that &apos;s valuable to us .
And it &apos;s really given .
These two things have to come together .
It has to be something valuable , and it &apos;s a real gift .
And when these two things come together , something that &apos;s really valuable to me and I realize it &apos;s freely given , then gratefulness spontaneously rises in my heart , happiness spontaneously rises in my heart .
That &apos;s how gratefulness happens .
We cannot only have grateful experiences .
We can be people who live gratefully .
Grateful living , that is the thing .
It &apos;s a gift . You haven &apos;t earned it .
You haven &apos;t brought it about in any way .
If we didn &apos;t have this present moment , we wouldn &apos;t have any opportunity to do anything or experience anything , and this moment is a gift .
Now , we say the gift within this gift is really the opportunity .
Behold the master key to our happiness in our own hands .
Moment by moment , we can be grateful for this gift .
Does that mean that we can be grateful for everything ?
Certainly not .
It isn &apos;t as bad as it might seem .
Learning patience , for instance .
We have been told that the road to peace is not a sprint , but is more like a marathon .
That takes patience . That &apos;s difficult .
It may be to stand up for your opinion , to stand up for your conviction .
That &apos;s an opportunity that is given to us .
They make something out of life .
That &apos;s the wonderful richness of life .
So how can we find a method that will harness this ?
Stop .
We rush through life . We don &apos;t stop .
We miss the opportunity because we don &apos;t stop .
We have to stop .
In Africa where I was , I didn &apos;t have drinkable water .
Every time I turned on the faucet , I was overwhelmed .
Every time I clicked on the light , I was so grateful .
But after a while , this wears off .
So I put little stickers on the light switch and on the water faucet , and every time I turned it on , water .
So leave it up to your own imagination .
You open your ears . You open your nose .
Stop , look , and then go , and really do something .
Mostly it &apos;s the opportunity to enjoy , but sometimes it &apos;s something more difficult .
The future of the world will be a network , not a pyramid turned upside down .
A grateful world is a world of joyful people .
We have a network for grateful living , and it has mushroomed .
We couldn &apos;t understand why it mushroomed .
We have an opportunity for people to light a candle when they are grateful for something .
Thank you .
So , I was in the hospital for a long time .
And a few years after I left , I went back , and the chairman of the burn department was very excited to see me — said , &quot; &quot; Dan , I have a fantastic new treatment for you . &quot; &quot; I was very excited . I walked with him to his office .
And he explained to me that , when I shave , I have little black dots on the left side of my face where the hair is , but on the right side of my face I was badly burned so I have no hair , and this creates lack of symmetry .
And what &apos;s the brilliant idea he had ?
He was going to tattoo little black dots on the right side of my face and make me look very symmetric .
It sounded interesting . He asked me to go and shave .
Let me tell you , this was a strange way to shave , because I thought about it and I realized that the way I was shaving then would be the way I would shave for the rest of my life — because I had to keep the width the same .
When I got back to his office , I wasn &apos;t really sure .
I said , &quot; &quot; Can I see some evidence for this ? &quot; &quot; So he showed me some pictures of little cheeks with little black dots — not very informative .
I said , &quot; &quot; What happens when I grow older and my hair becomes white ?
What would happen then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , don &apos;t worry about it , &quot; &quot; he said .
&quot; We have lasers ; we can whiten it out . &quot;
But I was still concerned , so I said , &quot; &quot; You know what , I &apos;m not going to do it . &quot; &quot; And then came one of the biggest guilt trips of my life .
This is coming from a Jewish guy , all right , so that means a lot .
( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Dan , what &apos;s wrong with you ?
Do you enjoy looking non-symmetric ?
Do you have some kind of perverted pleasure from this ?
Do women feel pity for you and have sex with you more frequently ? &quot; &quot; None of those happened .
And this was very surprising to me , because I &apos;ve gone through many treatments — there were many treatments I decided not to do — and I never got this guilt trip to this extent .
But I decided not to have this treatment .
And I went to his deputy and asked him , &quot; &quot; What was going on ?
Where was this guilt trip coming from ? &quot; &quot; And he explained that they have done this procedure on two patients already , and they need the third patient for a paper they were writing .
( Laughter ) Now you probably think that this guy &apos;s a schmuck .
Right , that &apos;s what he seems like .
But let me give you a different perspective on the same story .
A few years ago , I was running some of my own experiments in the lab .
And when we run experiments , we usually hope that one group will behave differently than another .
So we had one group that I hoped their performance would be very high , another group that I thought their performance would be very low , and when I got the results , that &apos;s what we got — I was very happy — aside from one person .
There was one person in the group that was supposed to have very high performance that was actually performing terribly .
And he pulled the whole mean down , destroying my statistical significance of the test .
So I looked carefully at this guy .
He was 20-some years older than anybody else in the sample .
And I remembered that the old and drunken guy came one day to the lab wanting to make some easy cash and this was the guy .
&quot; &quot; Fantastic ! &quot; &quot; I thought . &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s throw him out .
Who would ever include a drunken guy in a sample ? &quot; &quot; But a couple of days later , we thought about it with my students , and we said , &quot; &quot; What would have happened if this drunken guy was not in that condition ?
What would have happened if he was in the other group ?
Would we have thrown him out then ? &quot; &quot; We probably wouldn &apos;t have looked at the data at all , and if we did look at the data , we &apos;d probably have said , &quot; &quot; Fantastic ! What a smart guy who is performing this low , &quot; &quot; because he would have pulled the mean of the group lower , giving us even stronger statistical results than we could .
So we decided not to throw the guy out and to rerun the experiment .
But you know , these stories , and lots of other experiments that we &apos;ve done on conflicts of interest , basically kind of bring two points to the foreground for me .
The first one is that in life we encounter many people who , in some way or another , try to tattoo our faces .
They just have the incentives that get them to be blinded to reality and give us advice that is inherently biased .
And I &apos;m sure that it &apos;s something that we all recognize , and we see that it happens .
Maybe we don &apos;t recognize it every time , but we understand that it happens .
The most difficult thing , of course , is to recognize that sometimes we too are blinded by our own incentives .
And that &apos;s a much , much more difficult lesson to take into account .
Because we don &apos;t see how conflicts of interest work on us .
When I was doing these experiments , in my mind , I was helping science .
I was eliminating the data to get the true pattern of the data to shine through .
I wasn &apos;t doing something bad .
In my mind , I was actually a knight trying to help science move along .
But this was not the case .
I was actually interfering with the process with lots of good intentions .
And I think the real challenge is to figure out where are the cases in our lives where conflicts of interest work on us , and try not to trust our own intuition to overcome it , but to try to do things that prevent us from falling prey to these behaviors , because we can create lots of undesirable circumstances .
I do want to leave you with one positive thought .
I mean , this is all very depressing , right — people have conflicts of interest , we don &apos;t see it , and so on .
The positive perspective , I think , of all of this is that , if we do understand when we go wrong , if we understand the deep mechanisms of why we fail and where we fail , we can actually hope to fix things .
And that , I think , is the hope . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
In fact , I loved the movie , how they duplicated all my projects .
Some of these oftentimes have problems with reading .
And let &apos;s talk about jobs .
And we need to be working with these students .
And this brings up mentors .
The most massive tsunami perfect storm is bearing down upon us .
This perfect storm is mounting a grim reality , increasingly grim reality , and we are facing that reality with the full belief that we can solve our problems with technology , and that &apos;s very understandable .
Now , this perfect storm that we are facing is the result of our rising population , rising towards 10 billion people , land that is turning to desert , and , of course , climate change .
Now there &apos;s no question about it at all : we will only solve the problem of replacing fossil fuels with technology .
But fossil fuels , carbon — coal and gas — are by no means the only thing that is causing climate change .
Desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert , and this happens only when we create too much bare ground .
There &apos;s no other cause .
And I intend to focus on most of the world &apos;s land that is turning to desert .
We have environments where humidity is guaranteed throughout the year .
On those , it is almost impossible to create vast areas of bare ground .
No matter what you do , nature covers it up so quickly .
And we have environments where we have months of humidity followed by months of dryness , and that is where desertification is occurring .
Fortunately , with space technology now , we can look at it from space , and when we do , you can see the proportions fairly well .
Generally , what you see in green is not desertifying , and what you see in brown is , and these are by far the greatest areas of the Earth .
About two thirds , I would guess , of the world is desertifying .
I took this picture in the Tihamah Desert while 25 millimeters — that &apos;s an inch of rain — was falling .
Think of it in terms of drums of water , each containing 200 liters .
Over 1,000 drums of water fell on every hectare of that land that day .
The next day , the land looked like this .
Where had that water gone ?
Some of it ran off as flooding , but most of the water that soaked into the soil simply evaporated out again , exactly as it does in your garden if you leave the soil uncovered .
Now , because the fate of water and carbon are tied to soil organic matter , when we damage soils , you give off carbon .
Carbon goes back to the atmosphere .
Now you &apos;re told over and over , repeatedly , that desertification is only occurring in arid and semi-arid areas of the world , and that tall grasslands like this one in high rainfall are of no consequence .
But if you do not look at grasslands but look down into them , you find that most of the soil in that grassland that you &apos;ve just seen is bare and covered with a crust of algae , leading to increased runoff and evaporation .
That is the cancer of desertification that we do not recognize till its terminal form .
Now we know that desertification is caused by livestock , mostly cattle , sheep and goats , overgrazing the plants , leaving the soil bare and giving off methane .
Almost everybody knows this , from nobel laureates to golf caddies , or was taught it , as I was .
Now , the environments like you see here , dusty environments in Africa where I grew up , and I loved wildlife , and so I grew up hating livestock because of the damage they were doing .
And then my university education as an ecologist reinforced my beliefs .
Well , I have news for you .
We were once just as certain that the world was flat .
We were wrong then , and we are wrong again .
And I want to invite you now to come along on my journey of reeducation and discovery .
When I was a young man , a young biologist in Africa , I was involved in setting aside marvelous areas as future national parks .
Now no sooner — this was in the 1950s — and no sooner did we remove the hunting , drum-beating people to protect the animals , than the land began to deteriorate , as you see in this park that we formed .
Now , no livestock were involved , but suspecting that we had too many elephants now , I did the research and I proved we had too many , and I recommended that we would have to reduce their numbers and bring them down to a level that the land could sustain .
Now , that was a terrible decision for me to have to make , and it was political dynamite , frankly .
So our government formed a team of experts to evaluate my research .
They did . They agreed with me , and over the following years , we shot 40,000 elephants to try to stop the damage .
And it got worse , not better .
Loving elephants as I do , that was the saddest and greatest blunder of my life , and I will carry that to my grave .
One good thing did come out of it .
It made me absolutely determined to devote my life to finding solutions .
When I came to the United States , I got a shock , to find national parks like this one desertifying as badly as anything in Africa .
And there &apos;d been no livestock on this land for over 70 years .
And I found that American scientists had no explanation for this except that it is arid and natural .
So I then began looking at all the research plots I could over the whole of the Western United States where cattle had been removed to prove that it would stop desertification , but I found the opposite , as we see on this research station , where this grassland that was green in 1961 , by 2002 had changed to that situation .
And the authors of the position paper on climate change from which I obtained these pictures attribute this change to &quot; &quot; unknown processes . &quot; &quot; Clearly , we have never understood what is causing desertification , which has destroyed many civilizations and now threatens us globally .
We have never understood it .
Take one square meter of soil and make it bare like this is down here , and I promise you , you will find it much colder at dawn and much hotter at midday than that same piece of ground if it &apos;s just covered with litter , plant litter .
You have changed the microclimate .
Now , by the time you are doing that and increasing greatly the percentage of bare ground on more than half the world &apos;s land , you are changing macroclimate .
But we have just simply not understood why was it beginning to happen 10,000 years ago ?
Why has it accelerated lately ?
We had no understanding of that .
What we had failed to understand was that these seasonal humidity environments of the world , the soil and the vegetation developed with very large numbers of grazing animals , and that these grazing animals developed with ferocious pack-hunting predators .
Now , the main defense against pack-hunting predators is to get into herds , and the larger the herd , the safer the individuals .
Now , large herds dung and urinate all over their own food , and they have to keep moving , and it was that movement that prevented the overgrazing of plants , while the periodic trampling ensured good cover of the soil , as we see where a herd has passed .
This picture is a typical seasonal grassland .
It has just come through four months of rain , and it &apos;s now going into eight months of dry season .
And watch the change as it goes into this long dry season .
Now , all of that grass you see aboveground has to decay biologically before the next growing season , and if it doesn &apos;t , the grassland and the soil begin to die .
Now , if it does not decay biologically , it shifts to oxidation , which is a very slow process , and this smothers and kills grasses , leading to a shift to woody vegetation and bare soil , releasing carbon .
To prevent that , we have traditionally used fire .
But fire also leaves the soil bare , releasing carbon , and worse than that , burning one hectare of grassland gives off more , and more damaging , pollutants than 6,000 cars .
And we are burning in Africa , every single year , more than one billion hectares of grasslands , and almost nobody is talking about it .
We justify the burning , as scientists , because it does remove the dead material and it allows the plants to grow .
Now , looking at this grassland of ours that has gone dry , what could we do to keep that healthy ?
And bear in mind , I &apos;m talking of most of the world &apos;s land now .
Okay ? We cannot reduce animal numbers to rest it more without causing desertification and climate change .
We cannot burn it without causing desertification and climate change .
What are we going to do ?
There is only one option , I &apos;ll repeat to you , only one option left to climatologists and scientists , and that is to do the unthinkable , and to use livestock , bunched and moving , as a proxy for former herds and predators , and mimic nature .
There is no other alternative left to mankind .
So let &apos;s do that .
So on this bit of grassland , we &apos;ll do it , but just in the foreground .
We &apos;ll impact it very heavily with cattle to mimic nature , and we &apos;ve done so , and look at that .
All of that grass is now covering the soil as dung , urine and litter or mulch , as every one of the gardeners amongst you would understand , and that soil is ready to absorb and hold the rain , to store carbon , and to break down methane .
And we did that , without using fire to damage the soil , and the plants are free to grow .
When I first realized that we had no option as scientists but to use much-vilified livestock to address climate change and desertification , I was faced with a real dilemma .
How were we to do it ?
We &apos;d had 10,000 years of extremely knowledgeable pastoralists bunching and moving their animals , but they had created the great manmade deserts of the world .
Then we &apos;d had 100 years of modern rain science , and that had accelerated desertification , as we first discovered in Africa and then confirmed in the United States , and as you see in this picture of land managed by the federal government .
Clearly more was needed than bunching and moving the animals , and humans , over thousands of years , had never been able to deal with nature &apos;s complexity .
But we biologists and ecologists had never tackled anything as complex as this .
So rather than reinvent the wheel , I began studying other professions to see if anybody had .
And I found there were planning techniques that I could take and adapt to our biological need , and from those I developed what we call holistic management and planned grazing , a planning process , and that does address all of nature &apos;s complexity and our social , environmental , economic complexity .
Today , we have young women like this one teaching villages in Africa how to put their animals together into larger herds , plan their grazing to mimic nature , and where we have them hold their animals overnight — we run them in a predator-friendly manner , because we have a lot of lands , and so on — and where they do this and hold them overnight to prepare the crop fields , we are getting very great increases in crop yield as well .
Let &apos;s look at some results .
This is land close to land that we manage in Zimbabwe .
It has just come through four months of very good rains it got that year , and it &apos;s going into the long dry season .
But as you can see , all of that rain , almost of all it , has evaporated from the soil surface .
Their river is dry despite the rain just having ended , and we have 150,000 people on almost permanent food aid .
Now let &apos;s go to our land nearby on the same day , with the same rainfall , and look at that .
Our river is flowing and healthy and clean .
It &apos;s fine .
The production of grass , shrubs , trees , wildlife , everything is now more productive , and we have virtually no fear of dry years .
And we did that by increasing the cattle and goats 400 percent , planning the grazing to mimic nature and integrate them with all the elephants , buffalo , giraffe and other animals that we have .
But before we began , our land looked like that .
This site was bare and eroding for over 30 years regardless of what rain we got .
Okay ? Watch the marked tree and see the change as we use livestock to mimic nature .
This was another site where it had been bare and eroding , and at the base of the marked small tree , we had lost over 30 centimeters of soil . Okay ?
And again , watch the change just using livestock to mimic nature .
And there are fallen trees in there now , because the better land is now attracting elephants , etc .
This land in Mexico was in terrible condition , and I &apos;ve had to mark the hill because the change is so profound .
( Applause ) I began helping a family in the Karoo Desert in the 1970s turn the desert that you see on the right there back to grassland , and thankfully , now their grandchildren are on the land with hope for the future .
And look at the amazing change in this one , where that gully has completely healed using nothing but livestock mimicking nature , and once more , we have the third generation of that family on that land with their flag still flying .
The vast grasslands of Patagonia are turning to desert as you see here .
The man in the middle is an Argentinian researcher , and he has documented the steady decline of that land over the years as they kept reducing sheep numbers .
They put 25,000 sheep in one flock , really mimicking nature now with planned grazing , and they have documented a 50-percent increase in the production of the land in the first year .
We now have in the violent Horn of Africa pastoralists planning their grazing to mimic nature and openly saying it is the only hope they have of saving their families and saving their culture .
Ninety-five percent of that land can only feed people from animals .
I remind you that I am talking about most of the world &apos;s land here that controls our fate , including the most violent region of the world , where only animals can feed people from about 95 percent of the land .
What we are doing globally is causing climate change as much as , I believe , fossil fuels , and maybe more than fossil fuels .
But worse than that , it is causing hunger , poverty , violence , social breakdown and war , and as I am talking to you , millions of men , women and children are suffering and dying .
And if this continues , we are unlikely to be able to stop the climate changing , even after we have eliminated the use of fossil fuels .
I believe I &apos;ve shown you how we can work with nature at very low cost to reverse all this .
We are already doing so on about 15 million hectares on five continents , and people who understand far more about carbon than I do calculate that , for illustrative purposes , if we do what I am showing you here , we can take enough carbon out of the atmosphere and safely store it in the grassland soils for thousands of years , and if we just do that on about half the world &apos;s grasslands that I &apos;ve shown you , we can take us back to pre-industrial levels , while feeding people .
I can think of almost nothing that offers more hope for our planet , for your children , and their children , and all of humanity .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you , Chris .
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I have , and I &apos;m sure everyone here has , A ) a hundred questions , B ) wants to hug you .
I &apos;m just going to ask you one quick question .
When you first start this and you bring in a flock of animals , it &apos;s desert . What do they eat ? How does that part work ?
How do you start ?
Allan Savory : Well , we have done this for a long time , and the only time we have ever had to provide any feed is during mine reclamation , where it &apos;s 100 percent bare .
But many years ago , we took the worst land in Zimbabwe , where I offered a £ 5 note in a hundred-mile drive if somebody could find one grass in a hundred-mile drive , and on that , we trebled the stocking rate , the number of animals , in the first year with no feeding , just by the movement , mimicking nature , and using a sigmoid curve , that principle .
It &apos;s a little bit technical to explain here , but just that .
CA : Well , I would love to — I mean , this such an interesting and important idea .
The best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you and try and — I want to get more on this that we could share along with the talk.AS : Wonderful .
CA : That is an astonishing talk , truly an astonishing talk , and I think you heard that we all are cheering you on your way .
Thank you so much.AS : Well , thank you . Thank you . Thank you , Chris .

This summer I was back in Ohio for a family wedding , and when I was there , there was a meet and greet with Anna and Elsa from &quot; &quot; Frozen . &quot; &quot; Not the Anna and Elsa from &quot; &quot; Frozen , &quot; &quot; as this was not a Disney-sanctioned event .
These two entrepreneurs had a business of running princess parties .
Your kid is turning five ?
They &apos;ll come sing some songs , sprinkle some fairy dust , it &apos;s great .
It &apos;s like Santa Claus without the seasonal restrictions .
She could care less that these two women were signing posters and coloring books as Snow Queen and Princess Ana with one N to avoid copyright lawsuits .
We get there at 10 o &apos;clock , the scheduled start time , and we are handed number 59 .
By 11 o &apos;clock they had called numbers 21 through 25 ; this was going to be a while , and there is no amount of free face painting or temporary tattoos that could prevent the meltdowns that were occurring outside of the store .
And as we walk in , it is a scene I can only describe you as saying it looked like Norway threw up .
And as we moved forward , her excitement only grew , and as we finally got to the front of the line , and number 58 unfurled her poster to be signed by the princesses , I could literally feel the excitement running through her body .
And let &apos;s be honest , at that point , I was pretty excited too .
So we get to the front of the line , and the haggard clerk turns to my niece and says , &quot; &quot; Hi , honey . You &apos;re next !
Do you want to get down , or you &apos;re going to stay on your dad &apos;s shoulders for the picture ? &apos; ( Laughter ) And I was , for a lack of a better word , frozen . ( Laughter )
It &apos;s amazing that in an unexpected instant we are faced with the question , who am I ?
Am I an aunt ? Or am I an advocate ?
Millions of people have seen my video about how to have a hard conversation , and there one was , right in front of me .
At the same time , there &apos;s nothing more important to me than the kids in my life , so I found myself in a situation that we so often find ourselves in , torn between two things , two impossible choices .
Would I be an advocate ?
Would I take my niece off my shoulders and turn to the clerk and explain to her that I was in fact her aunt , not her father , and that she should be more careful and not to jump to gender conclusions based on haircuts and shoulder rides — ( Laughter ) — and while doing that , miss out on what was , to this point , the greatest moment of my niece &apos;s life .
Or would I be an aunt ?
Would I brush off that comment , take a million pictures , and not be distracted for an instant from the pure joy of that moment , and by doing that , walk out with the shame that comes up for not standing up for myself , especially in front of my niece .
Who was I ?
Which one was more important ? Which role was more worth it ?
Was I an aunt ? Or was I an advocate ?
And I had a split second to decide .
We are taught right now that we are living in a world of constant and increasing polarity .
It &apos;s so black and white , so us and them , so right and wrong .
There is no middle , there is no gray , just polarity .
Polarity is a state in which two ideas or opinions are completely opposite from each other ; a diametrical opposition .
Which side are you on ?
Are you unequivocally and without question antiwar , pro-choice , anti-death penalty , pro-gun regulation , proponent of open borders and pro-union ?
Or , are you absolutely and uncompromisingly pro-war , pro-life , pro-death penalty , a believer that the Second Amendment is absolute , anti-immigrant and pro-business ?
It &apos;s all or none , you &apos;re with us or against us .
That is polarity .
The problem with polarity and absolutes is that it eliminates the individuality of our human experience and that makes it contradictory to our human nature .
But if we are pulled in these two directions , but it &apos;s not really where we exist — polarity is not our actual reality — where do we go from there ?
What &apos;s at the other end of that spectrum ?
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s an unattainable , harmonious utopia , I think the opposite of polarity is duality .
Duality is a state of having two parts , but not in diametrical opposition , in simultaneous existence .
Don &apos;t think it &apos;s possible ?
Here are the people I know : I know Catholics who are pro-choice , and feminists who wear hijabs , and veterans who are antiwar , and NRA members who think I should be able to get married .
But the question is : Can we own our duality ?
Can we have the courage to hold both things ?
I work at a restaurant in town , I became really good friends with the busser .
I was a server and we had a great relationship , we had a really great time together .
Her Spanish was great because she was from Mexico .
( Laughter ) That line actually went the other way .
Her English was limited , but significantly better than my Spanish .
But we were united by our similarities , not separated by our differences .
And we were close , even though we came from very different worlds .
She was from Mexico , she left her family behind so she could come here and afford them a better life back home .
She was a devout conservative Catholic , a believer in traditional family values , stereotypical roles of men and women , and I was , well , me .
( Laughter ) But the things that bonded us were when she asked about my girlfriend , or she shared pictures that she had from her family back home .
Those were the things that brought us together .
( Laughter ) And he said to her , &#91; in Spanish &#93; &quot; &quot; Does Ash have a boyfriend ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &#91; in Spanish &#93; &quot; &quot; No , she has a girlfriend . &quot; &quot; And he said , &#91; in Spanish &#93; &quot; &quot; A girlfriend ? ! ? &quot; &quot; And she set down her fork , and locked eyes with him , and said , &#91; in Spanish &#93; &quot; &quot; Yes , a girlfriend . That is all . &quot; &quot; And his smug smile quickly dropped to one of maternal respect , grabbed his plate , walked off , went back to work .
She never made eye contact with me .
She left , did the same thing — it was a 10-second conversation , such a short interaction .
And on paper , she had so much more in common with him : language , culture , history , family , her community was her lifeline here , but her moral compass trumped all of that .
And a little bit later , they were joking around in the kitchen in Spanish , that had nothing to do with me , and that is duality .
She didn &apos;t have to choose some P.C. stance on gayness over her heritage .
She didn &apos;t have to choose her family over our friendship .
It wasn &apos;t Jesus or Ash .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Her individual morality was so strongly rooted that she had the courage to hold both things .
Our moral integrity is our responsibility and we must be prepared to defend it even when it &apos;s not convenient .
That &apos;s what it means to be an ally , and if you &apos;re going to be an ally , you have to be an active ally : Ask questions , act when you hear something inappropriate , actually engage .
I had a family friend who for years used to call my girlfriend my lover .
Really ? Lover ?
So overly sexual , so &apos; 70s gay porn .
( Laughter ) But she was trying , and she asked .
She could have called her my friend , or my &quot; &quot; friend , &quot; &quot; or my &quot; &quot; special friend &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — or even worse , just not asked at all .
Believe me , we would rather have you ask .
I would rather have her say lover , than say nothing at all .
People often say to me , &quot; &quot; Well , Ash , I don &apos;t care .
I don &apos;t see race or religion or sexuality .
It doesn &apos;t matter to me . I don &apos;t see it . &quot; &quot; But I think the opposite of homophobia and racism and xenophobia is not love , it &apos;s apathy .
If you don &apos;t see my gayness , then you don &apos;t see me .
If it doesn &apos;t matter to you who I sleep with , then you cannot imagine what it feels like when I walk down the street late at night holding her hand , and approach a group of people and have to make the decision if I should hang on to it or if I should I drop it when all I want to do is squeeze it tighter .
And the small victory I feel when I make it by and don &apos;t have to let go .
And the incredible cowardice and disappointment I feel when I drop it .
If you do not see that struggle that is unique to my human experience because I am gay , then you don &apos;t see me .
If you are going to be an ally , I need you to see me .
As individuals , as allies , as humans , we need to be able to hold both things : both the good and the bad , the easy and the hard .
You don &apos;t learn how to hold two things just from the fluff , you learn it from the grit .
And what if duality is just the first step ?
What if through compassion and empathy and human interaction we are able to learn to hold two things ?
And if we can hold two things , we can hold four , and if we can hold four , we can hold eight , and if we can hold eight , we can hold hundreds .
We are complex individuals , swirls of contradiction .
You are all holding so many things right now .
What can you do to hold just a few more ?
So , back to Toledo , Ohio .
I &apos;m at the front of the line , niece on my shoulders , the frazzled clerk calls me Dad .
Have you ever been mistaken for the wrong gender ?
Not even that .
Have you ever been called something you are not ?
Here &apos;s what it feels like for me : I am instantly an internal storm of contrasting emotions .
I break out into a sweat that is a combination of rage and humiliation , I feel like the entire store is staring at me , and I simultaneously feel invisible .
I want to explode in a tirade of fury , and I want to crawl under a rock .
And top all of that off with the frustration that I &apos;m wearing an out-of-character tight-fitting purple t-shirt , so this whole store can see my boobs , to make sure this exact same thing doesn &apos;t happen .
( Laughter ) But , despite my best efforts to be seen as the gender I am , it still happens .
And I hope with every ounce of my body that no one heard — not my sister , not my girlfriend , and certainly not my niece .
I am accustomed to this familiar hurt , but I will do whatever I need to do to protect the people I love from it .
But then I take my niece off my shoulders , and she runs to Elsa and Anna — the thing she &apos;s been waiting so long for — and all that stuff goes away .
All that matters is the smile on her face .
And as the 30 seconds we waited two and a half hours for comes to a close we gather up our things , and I lock eyes with the clerk again ; and she gives me an apologetic smile and mouths , &quot; I am so sorry ! &quot;
( Laughter ) And her humanity , her willingness to admit her mistake disarms me immediately , then I give her a : &quot; &quot; It &apos;s okay , it happens . But thanks . &quot; &quot; And I realize in that moment that I don &apos;t have to be either an aunt or an advocate , I can be both .
I can live in duality , and I can hold two things .
And if I can hold two things in that environment , I can hold so many more things .
As my girlfriend and my niece hold hands and skip out the front of the door , I turn to my sister and say , &quot; &quot; Was it worth it ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; Are you kidding me ?
Did you see the look on her face ? This was the greatest day of her life ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; It was worth the two and a half hours in the heat , it was worth the overpriced coloring book that we already had a copy of . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; It was even worth you getting called Dad . &quot; ( Laughter )
And for the first time ever in my life , it actually was .
Thank you , Boulder . Have a good night .
( Applause )
I was excited to be a part of the &quot; &quot; Dream &quot; &quot; theme , and then I found out I &apos;m leading off the &quot; &quot; Nightmare ? &quot; &quot; section of it .
And I have some bad news , but I have a lot more good news .
I &apos;m going to propose three questions and the answer to the first one necessarily involves a little bad news .
But — hang on , because the answers to the second and third questions really are very positive .
So the first question is , &quot; &quot; Do we really have to change ? &quot; &quot; And of course , the Apollo Mission , among other things changed the environmental movement , really launched the modern environmental movement .
18 months after this Earthrise picture was first seen on earth , the first Earth Day was organized .
And we learned a lot about ourselves looking back at our planet from space .
And one of the things that we learned confirmed what the scientists have long told us .
One of the most essential facts about the climate crisis has to do with the sky .
As this picture illustrates , the sky is not the vast and limitless expanse that appears when we look up from the ground .
It is a very thin shell of atmosphere surrounding the planet .
That right now is the open sewer for our industrial civilization as it &apos;s currently organized .
We are spewing 110 million tons of heat-trapping global warming pollution into it every 24 hours , free of charge , go ahead .
And there are many sources of the greenhouse gases , I &apos;m certainly not going to go through them all .
I &apos;m going to focus on the main one , but agriculture is involved , diet is involved , population is involved .
Management of forests , transportation , the oceans , the melting of the permafrost .
But I &apos;m going to focus on the heart of the problem , which is the fact that we still rely on dirty , carbon-based fuels for 85 percent of all the energy that our world burns every year .
And you can see from this image that after World War II , the emission rates started really accelerating .
And the accumulated amount of man-made , global warming pollution that is up in the atmosphere now traps as much extra heat energy as would be released by 400,000 Hiroshima-class atomic bombs exploding every 24 hours , 365 days a year .
Fact-checked over and over again , conservative , it &apos;s the truth .
Let &apos;s look at the atmosphere .
This is a depiction of what we used to think of as the normal distribution of temperatures .
The white represents normal temperature days ; 1951-1980 are arbitrarily chosen .
But the entire curve has moved to the right in the 1980s .
And you &apos;ll see in the lower right-hand corner the appearance of statistically significant numbers of extremely hot days .
In the 90s , the curve shifted further .
And in the last 10 years , you see the extremely hot days are now more numerous than the cooler than average days .
In fact , they are 150 times more common on the surface of the earth than they were just 30 years ago .
So we &apos;re having record-breaking temperatures .
Fourteen of the 15 of the hottest years ever measured with instruments have been in this young century .
The hottest of all was last year .
Last month was the 371st month in a row warmer than the 20th-century average .
And for the first time , not only the warmest January , but for the first time , it was more than two degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the average .
These higher temperatures are having an effect on animals , plants , people , ecosystems .
But on a global basis , 93 percent of all the extra heat energy is trapped in the oceans .
And the scientists can measure the heat buildup much more precisely now at all depths : deep , mid-ocean , the first few hundred meters .
And this , too , is accelerating .
This has consequences .
The first order of consequence : the ocean-based storms get stronger .
Pope Francis , who has made such a difference to this whole issue , visited Tacloban right after that .
Superstorm Sandy went over areas of the Atlantic nine degrees warmer than normal before slamming into New York and New Jersey .
The second order of consequences are affecting all of us right now .
The warmer oceans are evaporating much more water vapor into the skies .
Average humidity worldwide has gone up four percent .
And it creates these atmospheric rivers .
The Brazilian scientists call them &quot; &quot; flying rivers . &quot; &quot; And they funnel all of that extra water vapor over the land where storm conditions trigger these massive record-breaking downpours .
This is from Montana .
Take a look at this storm last August .
As it moves over Tucson , Arizona .
It literally splashes off the city .
These downpours are really unusual .
Last July in Houston , Texas , it rained for two days , 162 billion gallons .
That represents more than two days of the full flow of Niagara Falls in the middle of the city , which was , of course , paralyzed .
These record downpours are creating historic floods and mudslides .
This one is from Chile last year .
And you &apos;ll see that warehouse going by .
There are oil tankers cars going by .
This is from Spain last September , you could call this the running of the cars and trucks , I guess .
Every night on the TV news now is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelation .
The insurance industry has certainly noticed , the losses have been mounting up .
They &apos;re not under any illusions about what &apos;s happening .
And the causality requires a moment of discussion .
We &apos;re used to thinking of linear cause and linear effect — one cause , one effect .
This is systemic causation .
It dries out the vegetation and causes more fires in the western part of North America .
There &apos;s certainly been evidence of that , a lot of them .
These climate-related disasters also have geopolitical consequences and create instability .
The climate-related historic drought that started in Syria in 2006 destroyed 60 percent of the farms in Syria , killed 80 percent of the livestock , and drove 1.5 million climate refugees into the cities of Syria , where they collided with another 1.5 million refugees from the Iraq War .
And along with other factors , that opened the gates of Hell that people are trying to close now .
Right now we &apos;re seeing microbial diseases from the tropics spread to the higher latitudes ; the transportation revolution has had a lot to do with this .
But the changing conditions change the latitudes and the areas where these microbial diseases can become endemic and change the range of the vectors , like mosquitoes and ticks that carry them .
The Zika epidemic now — we &apos;re better positioned in North America because it &apos;s still a little too cool and we have a better public health system .
But when women in some regions of South and Central America are advised not to get pregnant for two years — that &apos;s something new , that ought to get our attention .
And there are many factors because of it .
This is also connected to the extinction crisis .
We &apos;re in danger of losing 50 percent of all the living species on earth by the end of this century .
And already , land-based plants and animals are now moving towards the poles at an average rate of 15 feet per day .
And when the land-based ice of the Arctic melts , it raises sea level .
Paul Nicklen &apos;s beautiful photograph from Svalbard illustrates this .
It &apos;s more dangerous coming off Greenland and particularly , Antarctica .
The 10 largest risk cities for sea-level rise by population are mostly in South and Southeast Asia .
When you measure it by assets at risk , number one is Miami : three and a half trillion dollars at risk .
Number three : New York and Newark .
I was in Miami last fall during the supermoon , one of the highest high-tide days .
And there were fish from the ocean swimming in some of the streets of Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale and Del Rey .
And this happens regularly during the highest-tide tides now .
And the Mayor of Miami speaks for many when he says it is long past time this can be viewed through a partisan lens .
This is a crisis that &apos;s getting worse day by day .
We have to move beyond partisanship .
So the cost of the climate crisis is mounting up , there are many of these aspects I haven &apos;t even mentioned .
It &apos;s an enormous burden .
I &apos;ll mention just one more , because the World Economic Forum last month in Davos , after their annual survey of 750 economists , said the climate crisis is now the number one risk to the global economy .
So you get central bankers like Mark Carney , the head of the UK Central Bank , saying the vast majority of the carbon reserves are unburnable .
Subprime carbon .
I &apos;m not going to remind you what happened with subprime mortgages , but it &apos;s the same thing .
If you look at all of the carbon fuels that were burned since the beginning of the industrial revolution , this is the quantity burned in the last 16 years .
Here are all the ones that are proven and left on the books , 28 trillion dollars .
The International Energy Agency says only this amount can be burned .
So the rest , 22 trillion dollars — unburnable .
Risk to the global economy .
That &apos;s why divestment movement makes practical sense and is not just a moral imperative .
So the answer to the first question , &quot; &quot; Must we change ? &quot; &quot; is yes , we have to change .
Second question , &quot; &quot; Can we change ? &quot; &quot; This is the exciting news !
The best projections in the world 16 years ago were that by 2010 , the world would be able to install 30 gigawatts of wind capacity .
We beat that mark by 14 and a half times over .
We see an exponential curve for wind installations now .
We see the cost coming down dramatically .
Some countries — take Germany , an industrial powerhouse with a climate not that different from Vancouver &apos;s , by the way — one day last December , got 81 percent of all its energy from renewable resources , mainly solar and wind .
A lot of countries are getting more than half on an average basis .
The best projections 14 years ago were that we would install one gigawatt per year by 2010 .
When 2010 came around , we beat that mark by 17 times over .
Last year , we beat it by 58 times over .
This year , we &apos;re on track to beat it 68 times over .
We &apos;re going to win this .
We are going to prevail .
The exponential curve on solar is even steeper and more dramatic .
We have seen a revolutionary breakthrough in the emergence of these exponential curves .
And it &apos;s continuing to come down .
Now , the business community has certainly noticed this , because it &apos;s crossing the grid parity point .
Cheaper solar penetration rates are beginning to rise .
Grid parity is understood as that line , that threshold , below which renewable electricity is cheaper than electricity from burning fossil fuels .
It &apos;s a difference of more than one degree , it &apos;s the difference between ice and water .
And it &apos;s the difference between markets that are frozen up , and liquid flows of capital into new opportunities for investment .
This is the biggest new business opportunity in the history of the world , and two-thirds of it is in the private sector .
We are seeing an explosion of new investment .
Starting in 2010 , investments globally in renewable electricity generation surpassed fossils .
The gap has been growing ever since .
The projections for the future are even more dramatic , even though fossil energy is now still subsidized at a rate 40 times larger than renewables .
So is there any precedent for such a rapid adoption of a new technology ?
Well , there are many , but let &apos;s look at cell phones .
&quot; &quot; How many can we sell by the year 2000 ? &quot; &quot; they asked .
McKinsey came back and said , &quot; &quot; 900,000 . &quot; &quot; And sure enough , when the year 2000 arrived , they did sell 900,000 — in the first three days .
And for the balance of the year , they sold 120 times more .
And now there are more cell connections than there are people in the world .
First , the cost came down much faster than anybody expected , even as the quality went up .
And low-income countries , places that did not have a landline grid — they leap-frogged to the new technology .
The big expansion has been in the developing counties .
So what about the electricity grids in the developing world ?
Well , not so hot .
And in many areas , they don &apos;t exist .
There are more people without any electricity at all in India than the entire population of the United States of America .
So now we &apos;re getting this : solar panels on grass huts and new business models that make it affordable .
Muhammad Yunus financed this one in Bangladesh with micro-credit .
This is a village market .
It &apos;s actually a little bit less than an hour .
So the answer to the second question , &quot; &quot; Can we change ? &quot; &quot; is clearly &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s an ever-firmer &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; Last question , &quot; &quot; Will we change ? &quot; &quot; Paris really was a breakthrough , some of the provisions are binding and the regular reviews will matter a lot .
But nations aren &apos;t waiting , they &apos;re going ahead .
China has already announced that starting next year , they &apos;re adopting a nationwide cap and trade system .
They will likely link up with the European Union .
The United States has already been changing .
All of these coal plants were proposed in the next 10 years and canceled .
All of these existing coal plants were retired .
All of these coal plants have had their retirement announced .
All of them — canceled .
We are moving forward .
Last year — if you look at all of the investment in new electricity generation in the United States , almost three-quarters was from renewable energy , mostly wind and solar .
We are solving this crisis .
The only question is : how long will it take to get there ?
So , it matters that a lot of people are organizing to insist on this change .
Almost 400,000 people marched in New York City before the UN special session on this .
Many thousands , tens of thousands , marched in cities around the world .
And so , I am extremely optimistic .
As I said before , we are going to win this .
I &apos;ll finish with this story .
And I heard adults of that day and time say , &quot; That &apos;s reckless , expensive , may well fail . &quot;
But eight years and two months later , in the moment that Neil Armstrong set foot on the Moon , there was great cheer that went up in NASA &apos;s mission control in Houston .
Here &apos;s a little-known fact about that : the average age of the systems engineers , the controllers in the room that day , was 26 , which means , among other things , their age , when they heard that challenge , was 18 .
We now have a moral challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have faced .
One of the greatest poets of the last century in the US , Wallace Stevens , wrote a line that has stayed with me : &quot; &quot; After the final &apos; no , &apos; there comes a &apos; yes , &apos; and on that &apos; yes &apos; , the future world depends . &quot; &quot; When the abolitionists started their movement , they met with no after no after no .
And then came a yes .
The Women &apos;s Suffrage and Women &apos;s Rights Movement met endless no &apos;s , until finally , there was a yes .
The Civil Rights Movement , the movement against apartheid , and more recently , the movement for gay and lesbian rights here in the United States and elsewhere .
Ninety-nine percent of us , that is where we are now and it is why we &apos;re going to win this .
We have everything we need .
Some still doubt that we have the will to act , but I say the will to act is itself a renewable resource .
Thank you very much .
You &apos;ve got this scientist mind that can understand the full range of issues , and the ability to turn it into the most vivid language .
No one else can do that , that &apos;s why you led this thing .
It was amazing to see it 10 years ago , it was amazing to see it now .
Al Gore : Well , you &apos;re nice to say that , Chris .
And that &apos;s the key to trying to communicate .
CA : So , your talk . First part : terrifying , second part : incredibly hopeful .
AG : I think that the crossing — you know , I &apos;ve only been in the business world for 15 years .
But one of the things I &apos;ve learned is that apparently it matters if a new product or service is more expensive than the incumbent , or cheaper than .
Turns out , it makes a difference if it &apos;s cheaper than .
And I just don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to work .
And it didn &apos;t work out economically for some of them , but it kick-started this global revolution .
And what people in this audience do now with the knowledge that we are going to win this .
But it matters a lot how fast we win it .
If this turns out to be the year , that the partisan thing changes , as you said , it &apos;s no longer a partisan issue , but you bring along people from the other side together , backed by science , backed by these kinds of investment opportunities , backed by reason that you win the day — boy , that &apos;s really exciting .
Thank you so much .
AG : Thank you so much for bringing me back to TED .
What do I know that would cause me , a reticent , Midwestern scientist , to get myself arrested in front of the White House protesting ?
And what would you do if you knew what I know ?
Let &apos;s start with how I got to this point .
I was lucky to grow up at a time when it was not difficult for the child of a tenant farmer to make his way to the state university .
And I was really lucky to go to the University of Iowa where I could study under Professor James Van Allen who built instruments for the first U.S. satellites .
Professor Van Allen told me about observations of Venus , that there was intense microwave radiation .
Did it mean that Venus had an ionosphere ?
Or was Venus extremely hot ?
The right answer , confirmed by the Soviet Venera spacecraft , was that Venus was very hot — 900 degrees Fahrenheit .
And it was kept hot by a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere .
I was fortunate to join NASA and successfully propose an experiment to fly to Venus .
Our instrument took this image of the veil of Venus , which turned out to be a smog of sulfuric acid .
But while our instrument was being built , I became involved in calculations of the greenhouse effect here on Earth , because we realized that our atmospheric composition was changing .
Eventually , I resigned as principal investigator on our Venus experiment because a planet changing before our eyes is more interesting and important .
Its changes will affect all of humanity .
The greenhouse effect had been well understood for more than a century .
British physicist John Tyndall , in the 1850 &apos;s , made laboratory measurements of the infrared radiation , which is heat .
And he showed that gasses such as CO2 absorb heat , thus acting like a blanket warming Earth &apos;s surface .
I worked with other scientists to analyze Earth climate observations .
In 1981 , we published an article in Science magazine concluding that observed warming of 0.4 degrees Celsius in the prior century was consistent with the greenhouse effect of increasing CO2 .
That Earth would likely warm in the 1980 &apos;s , and warming would exceed the noise level of random weather by the end of the century .
We also said that the 21st century would see shifting climate zones , creation of drought-prone regions in North America and Asia , erosion of ice sheets , rising sea levels and opening of the fabled Northwest Passage .
All of these impacts have since either happened or are now well under way .
That paper was reported on the front page of the New York Times and led to me testifying to Congress in the 1980 &apos;s , testimony in which I emphasized that global warming increases both extremes of the Earth &apos;s water cycle .
Heatwaves and droughts on one hand , directly from the warming , but also , because a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor with its latent energy , rainfall will become in more extreme events .
There will be stronger storms and greater flooding .
Global warming hoopla became time-consuming and distracted me from doing science — partly because I had complained that the White House altered my testimony .
So I decided to go back to strictly doing science and leave the communication to others .
By 15 years later , evidence of global warming was much stronger .
Most of the things mentioned in our 1981 paper were facts .
I had the privilege to speak twice to the president &apos;s climate task force .
But energy policies continued to focus on finding more fossil fuels .
By then we had two grandchildren , Sophie and Connor .
I decided that I did not want them in the future to say , &quot; &quot; Opa understood what was happening , but he didn &apos;t make it clear . &quot; &quot; So I decided to give a public talk criticizing the lack of an appropriate energy policy .
I gave the talk at the University of Iowa in 2004 and at the 2005 meeting of the American Geophysical Union .
This led to calls from the White House to NASA headquarters and I was told that I could not give any talks or speak with the media without prior explicit approval by NASA headquarters .
After I informed the New York Times about these restrictions , NASA was forced to end the censorship .
But there were consequences .
I had been using the first line of the NASA mission statement , &quot; To understand and protect the home planet , &quot; to justify my talks .
Soon the first line of the mission statement was deleted , never to appear again .
Over the next few years I was drawn more and more into trying to communicate the urgency of a change in energy policies , while still researching the physics of climate change .
Let me describe the most important conclusion from the physics — first , from Earth &apos;s energy balance and , second , from Earth &apos;s climate history .
Adding CO2 to the air is like throwing another blanket on the bed .
It reduces Earth &apos;s heat radiation to space , so there &apos;s a temporary energy imbalance .
More energy is coming in than going out , until Earth warms up enough to again radiate to space as much energy as it absorbs from the Sun .
So the key quantity is Earth &apos;s energy imbalance .
Is there more energy coming in than going out ?
If so , more warming is in the pipeline .
It will occur without adding any more greenhouse gasses .
Now finally , we can measure Earth &apos;s energy imbalance precisely by measuring the heat content in Earth &apos;s heat reservoirs .
The biggest reservoir , the ocean , was the least well measured , until more than 3,000 Argo floats were distributed around the world &apos;s ocean .
These floats reveal that the upper half of the ocean is gaining heat at a substantial rate .
The deep ocean is also gaining heat at a smaller rate , and energy is going into the net melting of ice all around the planet .
And the land , to depths of tens of meters , is also warming .
The total energy imbalance now is about six-tenths of a watt per square meter .
That may not sound like much , but when added up over the whole world , it &apos;s enormous .
It &apos;s about 20 times greater than the rate of energy use by all of humanity .
It &apos;s equivalent to exploding 400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs per day 365 days per year .
That &apos;s how much extra energy Earth is gaining each day .
This imbalance , if we want to stabilize climate , means that we must reduce CO2 from 391 ppm , parts per million , back to 350 ppm .
That is the change needed to restore energy balance and prevent further warming .
Climate change deniers argue that the Sun is the main cause of climate change .
But the measured energy imbalance occurred during the deepest solar minimum in the record , when the Sun &apos;s energy reaching Earth was least .
Yet , there was more energy coming in than going out .
This shows that the effect of the Sun &apos;s variations on climate is overwhelmed by the increasing greenhouse gasses , mainly from burning fossil fuels .
Now consider Earth &apos;s climate history .
These curves for global temperature , atmospheric CO2 and sea level were derived from ocean cores and Antarctic ice cores , from ocean sediments and snowflakes that piled up year after year over 800,000 years forming a two-mile thick ice sheet .
As you see , there &apos;s a high correlation between temperature , CO2 and sea level .
Careful examination shows that the temperature changes slightly lead the CO2 changes by a few centuries .
Climate change deniers like to use this fact to confuse and trick the public by saying , &quot; &quot; Look , the temperature causes CO2 to change , not vice versa . &quot; &quot; But that lag is exactly what is expected .
Small changes in Earth &apos;s orbit that occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years alter the distribution of sunlight on Earth .
When there is more sunlight at high latitudes in summer , ice sheets melt .
Shrinking ice sheets make the planet darker , so it absorbs more sunlight and becomes warmer .
A warmer ocean releases CO2 , just as a warm Coca-Cola does .
And more CO2 causes more warming .
So CO2 , methane , and ice sheets were feedbacks that amplified global temperature change causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge , even though the climate change was initiated by a very weak forcing .
The important point is that these same amplifying feedbacks will occur today .
The physics does not change .
As Earth warms , now because of extra CO2 we put in the atmosphere , ice will melt , and CO2 and methane will be released by warming ocean and melting permafrost .
While we can &apos;t say exactly how fast these amplifying feedbacks will occur , it is certain they will occur , unless we stop the warming .
There is evidence that feedbacks are already beginning .
Precise measurements by GRACE , the gravity satellite , reveal that both Greenland and Antarctica are now losing mass , several hundred cubic kilometers per year .
And the rate has accelerated since the measurements began nine years ago .
Methane is also beginning to escape from the permafrost .
What sea level rise can we look forward to ?
The last time CO2 was 390 ppm , today &apos;s value , sea level was higher by at least 15 meters , 50 feet .
Where you are sitting now would be under water .
Most estimates are that , this century , we will get at least one meter .
I think it will be more if we keep burning fossil fuels , perhaps even five meters , which is 18 feet , this century or shortly thereafter .
The important point is that we will have started a process that is out of humanity &apos;s control .
Ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries .
There would be no stable shoreline .
The economic consequences are almost unthinkable .
Hundreds of New Orleans-like devastations around the world .
What may be more reprehensible , if climate denial continues , is extermination of species .
The monarch butterfly could be one of the 20 to 50 percent of all species that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates will be ticketed for extinction by the end of the century if we stay on business-as-usual fossil fuel use .
Global warming is already affecting people .
The Texas , Oklahoma , Mexico heatwave and drought last year , Moscow the year before and Europe in 2003 , were all exceptional events , more than three standard deviations outside the norm .
Fifty years ago , such anomalies covered only two- to three-tenths of one percent of the land area .
In recent years , because of global warming , they now cover about 10 percent — an increase by a factor of 25 to 50 .
So we can say with a high degree of confidence that the severe Texas and Moscow heatwaves were not natural ; they were caused by global warming .
An important impact , if global warming continues , will be on the breadbasket of our nation and the world , the Midwest and Great Plains , which are expected to become prone to extreme droughts , worse than the Dust Bowl , within just a few decades , if we let global warming continue .
How did I get dragged deeper and deeper into an attempt to communicate , giving talks in 10 countries , getting arrested , burning up the vacation time that I had accumulated over 30 years ?
More grandchildren helped me along .
Jake is a super-positive , enthusiastic boy .
Here at age two and a half years , he thinks he can protect his two and a half-day-old little sister .
It would be immoral to leave these young people with a climate system spiraling out of control .
Now the tragedy about climate change is that we can solve it with a simple , honest approach of a gradually rising carbon fee collected from fossil fuel companies and distributed 100 percent electronically every month to all legal residents on a per capita basis , with the government not keeping one dime .
Most people would get more in the monthly dividend than they &apos;d pay in increased prices .
This fee and dividend would stimulate the economy and innovations , creating millions of jobs .
It is the principal requirement for moving us rapidly to a clean energy future .
Several top economists are coauthors on this proposition .
Jim DiPeso of Republicans for Environmental Protection describes it thusly : &quot; &quot; Transparent . Market-based .
Does not enlarge government .
Leaves energy decisions to individual choices .
Sounds like a conservative climate plan . &quot; &quot; But instead of placing a rising fee on carbon emissions to make fossil fuels pay their true cost to society , our governments are forcing the public to subsidize fossil fuels by 400 to 500 billion dollars per year worldwide , thus encouraging extraction of every fossil fuel — mountaintop removal , longwall mining , fracking , tar sands , tar shale , deep ocean Arctic drilling .
This path , if continued , guarantees that we will pass tipping points leading to ice sheet disintegration that will accelerate out of control of future generations .
A large fraction of species will be committed to extinction .
And increasing intensity of droughts and floods will severely impact breadbaskets of the world , causing massive famines and economic decline .
Imagine a giant asteroid on a direct collision course with Earth .
That is the equivalent of what we face now .
Yet , we dither , taking no action to divert the asteroid , even though the longer we wait , the more difficult and expensive it becomes .
If we had started in 2005 , it would have required emission reductions of three percent per year to restore planetary energy balance and stabilize climate this century .
If we start next year , it is six percent per year .
If we wait 10 years , it is 15 percent per year — extremely difficult and expensive , perhaps impossible .
But we aren &apos;t even starting .
So now you know what I know that is moving me to sound this alarm .
Clearly , I haven &apos;t gotten this message across .
The science is clear .
I need your help to communicate the gravity and the urgency of this situation and its solutions more effectively .
We owe it to our children and grandchildren .
Thank you .

( Applause ) AIDS was discovered 1981 ; the virus , 1983 .
These Gapminder bubbles show you how the spread of the virus was in 1983 in the world , or how we estimate that it was .
What we are showing here is — on this axis here , I &apos;m showing percent of infected adults .
And on this axis , I &apos;m showing dollars per person in income .
And the size of these bubbles , the size of the bubbles here , that shows how many are infected in each country , and the color is the continent .
Now , you can see United States , in 1983 , had a very low percentage infected , but due to the big population , still a sizable bubble .
There were quite many people infected in the United States .
And , up there , you see Uganda .
They had almost five percent infected , and quite a big bubble in spite of being a small country , then .
And they were probably the most infected country in the world .
Now , what has happened ?
Now you have understood the graph and now , in the next 60 seconds , we will play the HIV epidemic in the world .
But first , I have a new invention here .
( Laughter ) I have solidified the beam of the laser pointer . ( Laughter )
( Applause ) So , ready , steady , go !
First , we have the fast rise in Uganda and Zimbabwe .
They went upwards like this .
In Asia , the first country to be heavily infected was Thailand — they reached one to two percent .
Then , Uganda started to turn back , whereas Zimbabwe skyrocketed , and some years later South Africa had a terrible rise of HIV frequency .
Look , India got many infected , but had a low level .
And almost the same happens here .
See , Uganda coming down , Zimbabwe coming down , Russia went to one percent .
In the last two to three years , we have reached a steady state of HIV epidemic in the world .
25 years it took .
But , steady state doesn &apos;t mean that things are getting better , it &apos;s just that they have stopped getting worse .
And it has — the steady state is , more or less , one percent of the adult world population is HIV-infected .
It means 30 to 40 million people , the whole of California — every person , that &apos;s more or less what we have today in the world .
Now , let me make a fast replay of Botswana .
Botswana — upper middle-income country in southern Africa , democratic government , good economy , and this is what happened there .
They started low , they skyrocketed , they peaked up there in 2003 , and now they are down .
But they are falling only slowly , because in Botswana , with good economy and governance , they can manage to treat people .
And if people who are infected are treated , they don &apos;t die of AIDS .
These percentages won &apos;t come down because people can survive 10 to 20 years .
So there &apos;s some problem with these metrics now .
But the poorer countries in Africa , the low-income countries down here , there the rates fall faster , of the percentage infected , because people still die .
In spite of PEPFAR , the generous PEPFAR , all people are not reached by treatment , and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries , only 60 percent are left on treatment after two years .
It &apos;s not realistic with lifelong treatment for everyone in the poorest countries .
But it &apos;s very good that what is done is being done .
But focus now is back on prevention .
It is only by stopping the transmission that the world will be able to deal with it .
Drugs is too costly — had we had the vaccine , or when we will get the vaccine , that &apos;s something more effective — but the drugs are very costly for the poor .
Not the drug in itself , but the treatment and the care which is needed around it .
So , when we look at the pattern , one thing comes out very clearly : you see the blue bubbles and people say HIV is very high in Africa .
I would say , HIV is very different in Africa .
You &apos;ll find the highest HIV rate in the world in African countries , and yet you &apos;ll find Senegal , down here — the same rate as United States .
And you &apos;ll find Madagascar , and you &apos;ll find a lot of African countries about as low as the rest of the world .
It &apos;s this terrible simplification that there &apos;s one Africa and things go on in one way in Africa .
We have to stop that .
It &apos;s not respectful , and it &apos;s not very clever to think that way .
( Applause ) I had the fortune to live and work for a time in the United States .
I found out that Salt Lake City and San Francisco were different .
( Laughter ) And so it is in Africa — it &apos;s a lot of difference .
So , why is it so high ? Is it war ?
No , it &apos;s not . Look here .
War-torn Congo is down there — two , three , four percent .
And this is peaceful Zambia , neighboring country — 15 percent .
And there &apos;s good studies of the refugees coming out of Congo — they have two , three percent infected , and peaceful Zambia — much higher .
There are now studies clearly showing that the wars are terrible , that rapes are terrible , but this is not the driving force for the high levels in Africa .
So , is it poverty ?
Well if you look at the macro level , it seems more money , more HIV .
But that &apos;s very simplistic , so let &apos;s go down and look at Tanzania .
I will split Tanzania in five income groups , from the highest income to the lowest income , and here we go .
The ones with the highest income , the better off — I wouldn &apos;t say rich — they have higher HIV .
The difference goes from 11 percent down to four percent , and it is even bigger among women .
There &apos;s a lot of things that we thought , that now , good research , done by African institutions and researchers together with the international researchers , show that that &apos;s not the case .
So , this is the difference within Tanzania .
And , I can &apos;t avoid showing Kenya .
Look here at Kenya .
I &apos;ve split Kenya in its provinces .
Here it goes .
See the difference within one African country — it goes from very low level to very high level , and most of the provinces in Kenya is quite modest .
So , what is it then ?
Why do we see this extremely high levels in some countries ?
Well , it is more common with multiple partners , there is less condom use , and there is age-disparate sex — that is , older men tend to have sex with younger women .
We see higher rates in younger women than younger men in many of these highly affected countries .
But where are they situated ?
I will swap the bubbles to a map .
Look , the highly infected are four percent of all population and they hold 50 percent of the HIV-infected .
HIV exists all over the world .
Look , you have bubbles all over the world here .
Brazil has many HIV-infected .
Arab countries not so much , but Iran is quite high .
They have heroin addiction and also prostitution in Iran .
India has many because they are many .
Southeast Asia , and so on .
But , there is one part of Africa — and the difficult thing is , at the same time , not to make a uniform statement about Africa , not to come to simple ideas of why it is like this , on one hand .
On the other hand , try to say that this is not the case , because there is a scientific consensus about this pattern now .
UNAIDS have done good data available , finally , about the spread of HIV .
It could be concurrency .
It could be some virus types .
It could be that there is other things which makes transmission occur in a higher frequency .
After all , if you are completely healthy and you have heterosexual sex , the risk of infection in one intercourse is one in 1,000 .
Don &apos;t jump to conclusions now on how to behave tonight and so on .
( Laughter ) But — and if you are in an unfavorable situation , more sexually transmitted diseases , it can be one in 100 .
But what we think is that it could be concurrency .
And what is concurrency ?
In Sweden , we have no concurrency .
We have serial monogamy .
Vodka , New Year &apos;s Eve — new partner for the spring .
Vodka , Midsummer &apos;s Eve — new partner for the fall .
Vodka — and it goes on like this , you know ?
And you collect a big number of exes .
And we have a terrible chlamydia epidemic — terrible chlamydia epidemic which sticks around for many years .
HIV has a peak three to six weeks after infection and therefore , having more than one partner in the same month is much more dangerous for HIV than others .
Probably , it &apos;s a combination of this .
And what makes me so happy is that we are moving now towards fact when we look at this .
You can get this chart , free .
We have uploaded UNAIDS data on the Gapminder site .
And we hope that when we act on global problems in the future we will not only have the heart , we will not only have the money , but we will also use the brain .
Thank you very much .

I consider it my life &apos;s mission to convey the urgency of climate change through my work .
I &apos;ve traveled north to the Arctic to the capture the unfolding story of polar melt , and south to the Equator to document the subsequent rising seas .
Most recently , I visited the icy coast of Greenland and the low-lying islands of the Maldives , connecting two seemingly disparate but equally endangered parts of our planet .
My drawings explore moments of transition , turbulence and tranquility in the landscape , allowing viewers to emotionally connect with a place you might never have the chance to visit .
I choose to convey the beauty as opposed to the devastation .
If you can experience the sublimity of these landscapes , perhaps you &apos;ll be inspired to protect and preserve them .
Behavioral psychology tells us that we take action and make decisions based on our emotions above all else .
And studies have shown that art impacts our emotions more effectively than a scary news report .
Experts predict ice-free Arctic summers as early as 2020 .
And sea levels are likely to rise between two and ten feet by century &apos;s end .
I have dedicated my career to illuminating these projections with an accessible medium , one that moves us in a way that statistics may not .
My process begins with traveling to the places at the forefront of climate change .
On-site , I take thousands of photographs .
Back in the studio , I work from both my memory of the experience and the photographs to create very large-scale compositions , sometimes over 10 feet wide .
I draw with soft pastel , which is dry like charcoal , but colors .
I consider my work drawings but others call them painting .
I cringe , though , when I &apos;m referred to as a &quot; &quot; finger painter . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But I don &apos;t use any tools and I have always used my fingers and palms to manipulate the pigment on the paper .
Drawing is a form of meditation for me .
It quiets my mind .
I don &apos;t perceive what I &apos;m drawing as ice or water .
Instead , the image is stripped down to its most basic form of color and shape .
Once the piece is complete , I can finally experience the composition as a whole , as an iceberg floating through glassy water , or a wave cresting with foam .
On average , a piece this size takes me about , as you can see , 10 seconds .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Really , more like 200 hours , 250 hours for something that size .
But I &apos;ve been drawing ever since I could hold a crayon , really .
My mom was an artist , and growing up , we always had art supplies all over the house .
My mother &apos;s love of photography propelled her to the most remote regions of the earth , and my family and I were fortunate enough to join and support her on these adventures .
We rode camels in Northern Africa and mushed on dog sleds near the North Pole .
In August of 2012 , I led my first expedition , taking a group of artists and scholars up the northwest coast of Greenland .
My mother was originally supposed to lead this trip .
She and I were in the early stages of planning , as we had intended to go together , when she fell victim to a brain tumor .
The cancer quickly took over her body and mind , and she passed away six months later .
During the months of her illness , though , her dedication to the expedition never wavered , and I made a promise to carry out her final journey .
My mother &apos;s passion for the Arctic echoed through my experience in Greenland , and I felt the power and the fragility of the landscape .
The sheer size of the icebergs is humbling .
The ice fields are alive with movement and sound in a way that I never expected .
I expanded the scale of my compositions to give you that same sense of awe that I experienced .
Yet , while the grandeur of the ice is evident , so , too , is its vulnerability .
From our boat , I could see the ice sweating under the unseasonably warm sun .
We had a chance to visit many of the Inuit communities in Greenland that now face huge challenges .
The locals spoke to me of vast areas of sea ice that are no longer freezing over as they once did .
And without ice , their hunting and harvesting grounds are severely diminished , threatening their way of life and survival .
The melting glaciers in Greenland are one of the largest contributing factors to rising sea levels , which have already begun to drown some of our world &apos;s lowest-lying islands .
One year after my trip to Greenland , I visited the Maldives , the lowest and flattest country in the entire world .
While I was there , I collected images and inspiration for a new body of work : drawings of waves lapping on the coast of a nation that could be entirely underwater within this century .
Devastating events happen every day on scales both global and personal .
When I was in Greenland , I scattered my mother &apos;s ashes amidst the melting ice .
Now she remains a part of the landscape she loved so much , even as it , too , passes and takes on new form .
Among the many gifts my mother gave me was the ability to focus on the positive , rather than the negative .
My drawings celebrate the beauty of what we all stand to lose .
I hope they can serve as records of sublime landscapes in flux , documenting the transition and inspiring our global community to take action for the future .
Thank you .

Up until now , our communication with machines has always been limited to conscious and direct forms .
Whether it &apos;s something simple like turning on the lights with a switch , or even as complex as programming robotics , we have always had to give a command to a machine , or even a series of commands , in order for it to do something for us .
Communication between people , on the other hand , is far more complex and a lot more interesting because we take into account so much more than what is explicitly expressed .
We observe facial expressions , body language , and we can intuit feelings and emotions from our dialogue with one another .
This actually forms a large part of our decision-making process .
Our vision is to introduce this whole new realm of human interaction into human-computer interaction so that computers can understand not only what you direct it to do , but it can also respond to your facial expressions and emotional experiences .
And what better way to do this than by interpreting the signals naturally produced by our brain , our center for control and experience .
Well , it sounds like a pretty good idea , but this task , as Bruno mentioned , isn &apos;t an easy one for two main reasons : First , the detection algorithms .
Our brain is made up of billions of active neurons , around 170,000 km of combined axon length .
When these neurons interact , the chemical reaction emits an electrical impulse , which can be measured .
The majority of our functional brain is distributed over the outer surface layer of the brain , and to increase the area that &apos;s available for mental capacity , the brain surface is highly folded .
Now this cortical folding presents a significant challenge for interpreting surface electrical impulses .
Each individual &apos;s cortex is folded differently , very much like a fingerprint .
So even though a signal may come from the same functional part of the brain , by the time the structure has been folded , its physical location is very different between individuals , even identical twins .
There is no longer any consistency in the surface signals .
Our breakthrough was to create an algorithm that unfolds the cortex , so that we can map the signals closer to its source , and therefore making it capable of working across a mass population .
The second challenge is the actual device for observing brainwaves .
EEG measurements typically involve a hairnet with an array of sensors , like the one that you can see here in the photo .
A technician will put the electrodes onto the scalp using a conductive gel or paste and usually after a procedure of preparing the scalp by light abrasion .
Now this is quite time consuming and isn &apos;t the most comfortable process .
And on top of that , these systems actually cost in the tens of thousands of dollars .
So with that , I &apos;d like to invite onstage Evan Grant , who is one of last year &apos;s speakers , who &apos;s kindly agreed to help me to demonstrate what we &apos;ve been able to develop .
( Applause ) So the device that you see is a 14-channel , high-fidelity EEG acquisition system .
It doesn &apos;t require any scalp preparation , no conductive gel or paste .
It only takes a few minutes to put on and for the signals to settle .
It &apos;s also wireless , so it gives you the freedom to move around .
And compared to the tens of thousands of dollars for a traditional EEG system , this headset only costs a few hundred dollars .
Now on to the detection algorithms .
So facial expressions — as I mentioned before in emotional experiences — are actually designed to work out of the box with some sensitivity adjustments available for personalization .
But with the limited time we have available , I &apos;d like to show you the cognitive suite , which is the ability for you to basically move virtual objects with your mind .
Now , Evan is new to this system , so what we have to do first is create a new profile for him .
He &apos;s obviously not Joanne — so we &apos;ll &quot; &quot; add user . &quot; &quot; Evan . Okay .
So the first thing we need to do with the cognitive suite is to start with training a neutral signal .
With neutral , there &apos;s nothing in particular that Evan needs to do .
He just hangs out . He &apos;s relaxed .
And the idea is to establish a baseline or normal state for his brain , because every brain is different .
It takes eight seconds to do this , and now that that &apos;s done , we can choose a movement-based action .
So Evan , choose something that you can visualize clearly in your mind .
Evan Grant : Let &apos;s do &quot; &quot; pull . &quot; &quot; Tan Le : Okay , so let &apos;s choose &quot; &quot; pull . &quot; &quot; So the idea here now is that Evan needs to imagine the object coming forward into the screen , and there &apos;s a progress bar that will scroll across the screen while he &apos;s doing that .
The first time , nothing will happen , because the system has no idea how he thinks about &quot; &quot; pull . &quot; &quot; But maintain that thought for the entire duration of the eight seconds .
So : one , two , three , go .
Okay .
So once we accept this , the cube is live .
So let &apos;s see if Evan can actually try and imagine pulling .
Ah , good job !
( Applause ) That &apos;s really amazing . ( Applause )
So we have a little bit of time available , so I &apos;m going to ask Evan to do a really difficult task .
And this one is difficult because it &apos;s all about being able to visualize something that doesn &apos;t exist in our physical world .
This is &quot; &quot; disappear . &quot; &quot; So what you want to do — at least with movement-based actions , we do that all the time , so you can visualize it .
But with &quot; &quot; disappear , &quot; &quot; there &apos;s really no analogies — so Evan , what you want to do here is to imagine the cube slowly fading out , okay .
Same sort of drill . So : one , two , three , go .
Okay . Let &apos;s try that .
Oh , my goodness . He &apos;s just too good .
Let &apos;s try that again .
EG : Losing concentration .
( Laughter ) TL : But we can see that it actually works , even though you can only hold it for a little bit of time .
As I said , it &apos;s a very difficult process to imagine this .
And the great thing about it is that we &apos;ve only given the software one instance of how he thinks about &quot; &quot; disappear . &quot; &quot; As there is a machine learning algorithm in this — ( Applause ) Thank you .
Good job . Good job .
( Applause ) Thank you , Evan , you &apos;re a wonderful , wonderful example of the technology .
So , as you can see , before , there is a leveling system built into this software so that as Evan , or any user , becomes more familiar with the system , they can continue to add more and more detections , so that the system begins to differentiate between different distinct thoughts .
And once you &apos;ve trained up the detections , these thoughts can be assigned or mapped to any computing platform , application or device .
So I &apos;d like to show you a few examples , because there are many possible applications for this new interface .
In games and virtual worlds , for example , your facial expressions can naturally and intuitively be used to control an avatar or virtual character .
Obviously , you can experience the fantasy of magic and control the world with your mind .
And also , colors , lighting , sound and effects can dynamically respond to your emotional state to heighten the experience that you &apos;re having , in real time .
And moving on to some applications developed by developers and researchers around the world , with robots and simple machines , for example — in this case , flying a toy helicopter simply by thinking &quot; &quot; lift &quot; &quot; with your mind .
The technology can also be applied to real world applications — in this example , a smart home .
You know , from the user interface of the control system to opening curtains or closing curtains .
And of course , also to the lighting — turning them on or off .
And finally , to real life-changing applications , such as being able to control an electric wheelchair .
In this example , facial expressions are mapped to the movement commands .
Man : Now blink right to go right .
Now blink left to turn back left .
Now smile to go straight .
TL : We really — Thank you .
( Applause ) We are really only scratching the surface of what is possible today , and with the community &apos;s input , and also with the involvement of developers and researchers from around the world , we hope that you can help us to shape where the technology goes from here . Thank you so much .
On January 4 , 1934 , a young man delivered a report to the United States Congress that 80 years on , still shapes the lives of everyone in this room today , still shapes the lives of everyone on this planet .
That young man wasn &apos;t a politician , he wasn &apos;t a businessman , a civil rights activist or a faith leader .
He was that most unlikely of heroes , an economist .
His name was Simon Kuznets and the report that he delivered was called &quot; National Income , 1929-1932 . &quot;
Now , you might think this is a rather dry and dull report .
And you &apos;re absolutely right .
It &apos;s dry as a bone .
But this report is the foundation of how , today , we judge the success of countries : what we know best as Gross Domestic Product , GDP .
GDP has defined and shaped our lives for the last 80 years .
And today I want to talk about a different way to measure the success of countries , a different way to define and shape our lives for the next 80 years .
But first , we have to understand how GDP came to dominate our lives .
Kuznets &apos; report was delivered at a moment of crisis .
The U.S. economy was plummeting into the Great Depression and policy makers were struggling to respond .
Struggling because they didn &apos;t know what was going on .
They didn &apos;t have data and statistics .
So what Kuznet &apos;s report gave them was reliable data on what the U.S. economy was producing , updated year by year .
And armed with this information , policy makers were , eventually , able to find a way out of the slump .
And because Kuznets &apos; invention was found to be so useful , it spread around the world .
And now today , every country produces GDP statistics .
But , in that first report , Kuznets himself delivered a warning .
It &apos;s in the introductory chapter .
On page seven he says , &quot; &quot; The welfare of a nation can , therefore , scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income as defined above . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not the greatest sound bite in the world , and it &apos;s dressed up in the cautious language of the economist .
But his message was clear : GDP is a tool to help us measure economic performance .
It &apos;s not a measure of our well-being .
And it shouldn &apos;t be a guide to all decision making .
But we have ignored Kuznets &apos; warning .
We live in a world where GDP is the benchmark of success in a global economy .
Our politicians boast when GDP goes up .
Markets move and trillions of dollars of capital move around the world based on which countries are going up and which countries are going down , all measured in GDP .
Our societies have become engines to create more GDP .
But we know that GDP is flawed .
It ignores the environment .
It counts bombs and prisons as progress .
It can &apos;t count happiness or community .
And it has nothing to say about fairness or justice .
Is it any surprise that our world , marching to the drumbeat of GDP , is teetering on the brink of environmental disaster and filled with anger and conflict ?
We need a better way to measure our societies , a measure based on the real things that matter to real people .
Do I have enough to eat ?
Can I read and write ?
Am I safe ?
Do I have rights ?
Do I live in a society where I &apos;m not discriminated against ?
Is my future and the future of my children prevented from environmental destruction ?
These are questions that GDP does not and cannot answer .
There have , of course , been efforts in the past to move beyond GDP .
But I believe that we &apos;re living in a moment when we are ready for a measurement revolution .
We &apos;re ready because we &apos;ve seen , in the financial crisis of 2008 , how our fetish for economic growth led us so far astray .
We &apos;ve seen , in the Arab Spring , how countries like Tunisia were supposedly economic superstars , but they were societies that were seething with discontentment .
We &apos;re ready , because today we have the technology to gather and analyze data in ways that would have been unimaginable to Kuznets .
Today , I &apos;d like to introduce you to the Social Progress Index .
It &apos;s a measure of the well-being of society , completely separate from GDP .
It &apos;s a whole new way of looking at the world .
The Social Progress Index begins by defining what it means to be a good society based around three dimensions .
The first is , does everyone have the basic needs for survival : food , water , shelter , safety ?
Secondly , does everyone have access to the building blocks to improve their lives : education , information , health and sustainable environment ?
And then third , does every individual have access to a chance to pursue their goals and dreams and ambitions free from obstacles ?
Do they have rights , freedom of choice , freedom from discrimination and access to the the world &apos;s most advanced knowledge ?
Together , these 12 components form the Social Progress framework .
And for each of these 12 components , we have indicators to measure how countries are performing .
Not indicators of effort or intention , but real achievement .
We don &apos;t measure how much a country spends on healthcare , we measure the length and quality of people &apos;s lives .
We don &apos;t measure whether governments pass laws against discrimination , we measure whether people experience discrimination .
But what you want to know is who &apos;s top , don &apos;t you ? ( Laughter ) I knew that , I knew that , I knew that .
Okay , I &apos;m going to show you .
I &apos;m going to show you on this chart .
So here we are , what I &apos;ve done here is put on the vertical axis social progress .
Higher is better .
And then , just for comparison , just for fun , on the horizontal axis is GDP per capita .
Further to the right is more .
So the country in the world with the highest social progress , the number one country on social progress is New Zealand .
( Applause ) Well done ! Never been ; must go .
( Laughter ) The country with the least social progress , I &apos;m sorry to say , is Chad .
I &apos;ve never been ; maybe next year .
( Laughter ) Or maybe the year after .
Now , I know what you &apos;re thinking .
You &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; Aha , but New Zealand has a higher GDP than Chad ! &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a good point , well made .
But let me show you two other countries .
Here &apos;s the United States — considerably richer than New Zealand , but with a lower level of social progress .
And then here &apos;s Senegal — it &apos;s got a higher level of social progress than Chad , but the same level of GDP .
So what &apos;s going on ? Well , look .
Let me bring in the rest of the countries of the world , the 132 we &apos;ve been able to measure , each one represented by a dot .
There we go . Lots of dots .
Now , obviously I can &apos;t do all of them , so a few highlights for you : The highest ranked G7 country is Canada .
My country , the United Kingdom , is sort of middling , sort of dull , but who cares — at least we beat the French .
( Laughter ) And then looking at the emerging economies , top of the BRICS , pleased to say , is Brazil .
( Applause ) Come on , cheer !
Go , Brazil !
Beating South Africa , then Russia , then China and then India .
Tucked away on the right-hand side , you will see a dot of a country with a lot of GDP but not a huge amount of social progress — that &apos;s Kuwait .
Just above Brazil is a social progress superpower — that &apos;s Costa Rica .
It &apos;s got a level of social progress the same as some Western European countries , with a much lower GDP .
Now , my slide is getting a little cluttered and I &apos;d like to step back a bit .
So let me take away these countries , and then pop in the regression line .
So this shows the average relationship between GDP and social progress .
The first thing to notice , is that there &apos;s lots of noise around the trend line .
And what this shows , what this empirically demonstrates , is that GDP is not destiny .
At every level of GDP per capita , there are opportunities for more social progress , risks of less .
The second thing to notice is that for poor countries , the curve is really steep .
So what this tells us is that if poor countries can get a little bit of extra GDP , and if they reinvest that in doctors , nurses , water supplies , sanitation , etc . , there &apos;s a lot of social progress bang for your GDP buck .
And that &apos;s good news , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve seen over the last 20 , 30 years , with a lot of people lifted out of poverty by economic growth and good policies in poorer countries .
But go on a bit further up the curve , and then we see it flattening out .
Each extra dollar of GDP is buying less and less social progress .
And with more and more of the world &apos;s population living on this part of the curve , it means GDP is becoming less and less useful as a guide to our development .
I &apos;ll show you an example of Brazil .
Here &apos;s Brazil : social progress of about 70 out of 100 , GDP per capita about 14,000 dollars a year .
And look , Brazil &apos;s above the line .
Brazil is doing a reasonably good job of turning GDP into social progress .
But where does Brazil go next ?
Let &apos;s say that Brazil adopts a bold economic plan to double GDP in the next decade .
But that is only half a plan .
It &apos;s less than half a plan , because where does Brazil want to go on social progress ?
Brazil , it &apos;s possible to increase your growth , increase your GDP , while stagnating or going backwards on social progress .
We don &apos;t want Brazil to become like Russia .
What you really want is for Brazil to get ever more efficient at creating social progress from its GDP , so it becomes more like New Zealand .
And what that means is that Brazil needs to prioritize social progress in its development plan and see that it &apos;s not just growth alone , it &apos;s growth with social progress .
And that &apos;s what the Social Progress Index does : It reframes the debate about development , not just about GDP alone , but inclusive , sustainable growth that brings real improvements in people &apos;s lives .
And it &apos;s not just about countries .
Earlier this year , with our friends from the Imazon nonprofit here in Brazil , we launched the first subnational Social Progress Index .
We did it for the Amazon region .
It &apos;s an area the size of Europe , 24 million people , one of the most deprived parts of the country .
And here are the results , and this is broken down into nearly 800 different municipalities .
And with this detailed information about the real quality of life in this part of the country , Imazon and other partners from government , business and civil society can work together to construct a development plan that will help really improve people &apos;s lives , while protecting that precious global asset that is the Amazon Rainforest .
And this is just the beginning , You can create a Social Progress Index for any state , region , city or municipality .
We all know and love TEDx ; this is Social Pogress-x .
This is a tool for anyone to come and use .
Contrary to the way we sometimes talk about it , GDP was not handed down from God on tablets of stone . ( Laughter ) It &apos;s a measurement tool invented in the 20th century to address the challenges of the 20th century .
In the 21st century , we face new challenges : aging , obesity , climate change , and so on .
To face those challenges , we need new tools of measurement , new ways of valuing progress .
Imagine if we could measure what nonprofits , charities , volunteers , civil society organizations really contribute to our society .
Imagine if businesses competed not just on the basis of their economic contribution , but on their contribution to social progress .
Imagine if we could hold politicians to account for really improving people &apos;s lives .
Imagine if we could work together — government , business , civil society , me , you — and make this century the century of social progress .
Thank you .

Three and a half years ago , I made one of the best decisions of my life .
As my New Year &apos;s resolution , I gave up dieting , stopped worrying about my weight , and learned to eat mindfully .
Now I eat whenever I &apos;m hungry , and I &apos;ve lost 10 pounds .
This was me at age 13 , when I started my first diet .
I look at that picture now , and I think , you did not need a diet , you needed a fashion consult .
( Laughter ) But I thought I needed to lose weight , and when I gained it back , of course I blamed myself .
And for the next three decades , I was on and off various diets .
No matter what I tried , the weight I &apos;d lost always came back .
I &apos;m sure many of you know the feeling .
As a neuroscientist , I wondered , why is this so hard ?
Obviously , how much you weigh depends on how much you eat and how much energy you burn .
What most people don &apos;t realize is that hunger and energy use are controlled by the brain , mostly without your awareness .
Your brain does a lot of its work behind the scenes , and that is a good thing , because your conscious mind — how do we put this politely ? — it &apos;s easily distracted .
It &apos;s good that you don &apos;t have to remember to breathe when you get caught up in a movie .
You don &apos;t forget how to walk because you &apos;re thinking about what to have for dinner .
You can use lifestyle choices to move your weight up and down within that range , but it &apos;s much , much harder to stay outside of it .
That &apos;s what a thermostat does , right ?
It keeps the temperature in your house the same as the weather changes outside .
Now you can try to change the temperature in your house by opening a window in the winter , but that &apos;s not going to change the setting on the thermostat , which will respond by kicking on the furnace to warm the place back up .
We would love to think that your brain could tell whether you need to lose weight or not , but it can &apos;t .
If you do lose a lot of weight , you become hungry , and your muscles burn less energy .
Dr. Rudy Leibel of Columbia University has found that people who have lost 10 percent of their body weight burn 250 to 400 calories less because their metabolism is suppressed .
That &apos;s a lot of food .
This means that a successful dieter must eat this much less forever than someone of the same weight who has always been thin .
From an evolutionary perspective , your body &apos;s resistance to weight loss makes sense .
When food was scarce , our ancestors &apos; survival depended on conserving energy , and regaining the weight when food was available would have protected them against the next shortage .
Over the course of human history , starvation has been a much bigger problem than overeating .
This may explain a very sad fact : Set points can go up , but they rarely go down .
Now , if your mother ever mentioned that life is not fair , this is the kind of thing she was talking about .
( Laughter ) Successful dieting doesn &apos;t lower your set point .
Even after you &apos;ve kept the weight off for as long as seven years , your brain keeps trying to make you gain it back .
If that weight loss had been due to a long famine , that would be a sensible response .
In our modern world of drive-thru burgers , it &apos;s not working out so well for many of us .
That difference between our ancestral past and our abundant present is the reason that Dr. Yoni Freedhoff of the University of Ottawa would like to take some of his patients back to a time when food was less available , and it &apos;s also the reason that changing the food environment is really going to be the most effective solution to obesity .
Sadly , a temporary weight gain can become permanent .
If you stay at a high weight for too long , probably a matter of years for most of us , your brain may decide that that &apos;s the new normal .
Psychologists classify eaters into two groups , those who rely on their hunger and those who try to control their eating through willpower , like most dieters .
Let &apos;s call them intuitive eaters and controlled eaters .
The interesting thing is that intuitive eaters are less likely to be overweight , and they spend less time thinking about food .
Controlled eaters are more vulnerable to overeating in response to advertising , super-sizing , and the all-you-can-eat buffet .
Children are especially vulnerable to this cycle of dieting and then binging .
So don &apos;t do that .
( Laughter ) I left almost all my graphs at home , but I couldn &apos;t resist throwing in just this one , because I &apos;m a geek , and that &apos;s how I roll . ( Laughter )
This is a study that looked at the risk of death over a 14-year period based on four healthy habits : eating enough fruits and vegetables , exercise three times a week , not smoking , and drinking in moderation .
Let &apos;s start by looking at the normal weight people in the study .
And as you &apos;d expect , the healthier the lifestyle , the less likely people were to die during the study .
Now let &apos;s look at what happens in overweight people .
The ones that had no healthy habits had a higher risk of death .
Adding just one healthy habit pulls overweight people back into the normal range .
For obese people with no healthy habits , the risk is very high , seven times higher than the healthiest groups in the study .
But a healthy lifestyle helps obese people too .
In fact , if you look only at the group with all four healthy habits , you can see that weight makes very little difference .
You can take control of your health by taking control of your lifestyle , even If you can &apos;t lose weight and keep it off .
Diets don &apos;t have very much reliability .
Five years after a diet , most people have regained the weight .
If I &apos;ve convinced you that dieting might be a problem , the next question is , what do you do about it ?
And my answer , in a word , is mindfulness .
I &apos;m not saying you need to learn to meditate or take up yoga .
I &apos;m talking about mindful eating : learning to understand your body &apos;s signals so that you eat when you &apos;re hungry and stop when you &apos;re full , because a lot of weight gain boils down to eating when you &apos;re not hungry .
How do you do it ?
Think about how your body feels when you start to eat and when you stop , and let your hunger decide when you should be done .
It took about a year for me to learn this , but it &apos;s really been worth it .
I am so much more relaxed around food than I have ever been in my life .
I often don &apos;t think about it .
I forget we have chocolate in the house .
It &apos;s like aliens have taken over my brain .
It &apos;s just completely different .
I should say that this approach to eating probably won &apos;t make you lose weight unless you often eat when you &apos;re not hungry , but doctors don &apos;t know of any approach that makes significant weight loss in a lot of people , and that is why a lot of people are now focusing on preventing weight gain instead of promoting weight loss .
Let &apos;s face it : If diets worked , we &apos;d all be thin already .
( Laughter ) Why do we keep doing the same thing and expecting different results ?
Diets may seem harmless , but they actually do a lot of collateral damage .
At worst , they ruin lives : Weight obsession leads to eating disorders , especially in young kids .
In the U.S. , we have 80 percent of 10-year-old girls say they &apos;ve been on a diet .
Our daughters have learned to measure their worth by the wrong scale .
Even at its best , dieting is a waste of time and energy .
Let me leave you with one last thought .
What if we told all those dieting girls that it &apos;s okay to eat when they &apos;re hungry ?
What if we taught them to work with their appetite instead of fearing it ?
I think most of them would be happier and healthier , and as adults , many of them would probably be thinner .
I wish someone had told me that back when I was 13 .
Thanks .
I &apos;m a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist , so I put children to sleep for a living .
( Laughter ) And I &apos;m an academic , so I put audiences to sleep for free . ( Laughter )
But what I actually mostly do is I manage the pain management service at the Packard Children &apos;s Hospital up at Stanford in Palo Alto .
And it &apos;s from the experience from about 20 or 25 years of doing that that I want to bring to you the message this morning , that pain is a disease .
Now most of the time , you think of pain as a symptom of a disease , and that &apos;s true most of the time .
It &apos;s the symptom of a tumor or an infection or an inflammation or an operation .
But about 10 percent of the time , after the patient has recovered from one of those events , pain persists .
It persists for months and oftentimes for years , and when that happens , it is its own disease .
And before I tell you about how it is that we think that happens and what we can do about it , I want to show you how it feels for my patients .
So imagine , if you will , that I &apos;m stroking your arm with this feather , as I &apos;m stroking my arm right now .
Now , I want you to imagine that I &apos;m stroking it with this .
Please keep your seat .
( Laughter ) A very different feeling .
Now what does it have to do with chronic pain ?
Imagine , if you will , these two ideas together .
Imagine what your life would be like if I were to stroke it with this feather , but your brain was telling you that this is what you are feeling — and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain .
In fact , imagine something even worse .
Imagine I were to stroke your child &apos;s arm with this feather , and their brain &#91; was &#93; telling them that they were feeling this hot torch .
That was the experience of my patient , Chandler , whom you see in the photograph .
As you can see , she &apos;s a beautiful , young woman .
She was 16 years old last year when I met her , and she aspired to be a professional dancer .
And during the course of one of her dance rehearsals , she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist .
Now you would probably imagine , as she did , that a wrist sprain is a trivial event in a person &apos;s life .
Wrap it in an ACE bandage , take some ibuprofen for a week or two , and that &apos;s the end of the story .
But in Chandler &apos;s case , that was the beginning of the story .
This is what her arm looked like when she came to my clinic about three months after her sprain .
You can see that the arm is discolored , purplish in color .
It was cadaverically cold to the touch .
The muscles were frozen , paralyzed — dystonic is how we refer to that .
The pain had spread from her wrist to her hands , to her fingertips , from her wrist up to her elbow , almost all the way to her shoulder .
But the worst part was , not the spontaneous pain that was there 24 hours a day .
The worst part was that she had allodynia , the medical term for the phenomenon that I just illustrated with the feather and with the torch .
The lightest touch of her arm — the touch of a hand , the touch even of a sleeve , of a garment , as she put it on — caused excruciating , burning pain .
How can the nervous system get this so wrong ? How can the nervous system
misinterpret an innocent sensation like the touch of a hand and turn it into the malevolent sensation of the touch of the flame ?
Well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hardwired like your house .
In your house , wires run in the wall , from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling and from the junction box to the light bulb .
And when you turn the switch on , the light goes on .
And when you turn the switch off , the light goes off .
So people imagine the nervous system is just like that .
If you hit your thumb with a hammer , these wires in your arm — that , of course , we call nerves — transmit the information into the junction box in the spinal cord where new wires , new nerves , take the information up to the brain where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt .
But the situation , of course , in the human body is far more complicated than that .
Instead of it being the case that that junction box in the spinal cord is just simple where one nerve connects with the next nerve by releasing these little brown packets of chemical information called neurotransmitters in a linear one-on-one fashion , in fact , what happens is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions — laterally , vertically , up and down in the spinal cord — and they start interacting with other adjacent cells .
These cells , called glial cells , were once thought to be unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord that did nothing more than hold all the important things together , like the nerves .
But it turns out the glial cells have a vital role in the modulation , amplification and , in the case of pain , the distortion of sensory experiences .
These glial cells become activated .
Their DNA starts to synthesize new proteins , which spill out and interact with adjacent nerves , and they start releasing their neurotransmitters , and those neurotransmitters spill out and activate adjacent glial cells , and so on and so forth , until what we have is a positive feedback loop .
It &apos;s almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your walls so that the next time you turned on the light switch , the toilet flushed three doors down , or your dishwasher went on , or your computer monitor turned off .
That &apos;s crazy , but that &apos;s , in fact , what happens with chronic pain .
And that &apos;s why pain becomes its own disease .
The nervous system has plasticity .
It changes , and it morphs in response to stimuli .
Well , what do we do about that ?
What can we do in a case like Chandler &apos;s ?
We treat these patients in a rather crude fashion at this point in time .
We treat them with symptom-modifying drugs — painkillers — which are , frankly , not very effective for this kind of pain .
We take nerves that are noisy and active that should be quiet , and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics .
And most importantly , what we do is we use a rigorous , and often uncomfortable , process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life .
And we support all of that with an intensive psychotherapy program to address the despondency , despair and depression that always accompanies severe , chronic pain .
It &apos;s successful , as you can see from this video of Chandler , who , two months after we first met her , is now doings a back flip .
And I had lunch with her yesterday because she &apos;s a college student studying dance at Long Beach here , and she &apos;s doing absolutely fantastic .
But the future is actually even brighter .
The future holds the promise that new drugs will be developed that are not symptom-modifying drugs that simply mask the problem , as we have now , but that will be disease-modifying drugs that will actually go right to the root of the problem and attack those glial cells , or those pernicious proteins that the glial cells elaborate , that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind-up , or plasticity , that so is capable of distorting and amplifying the sensory experience that we call pain .
So I have hope that in the future , the prophetic words of George Carlin will be realized , who said , &quot; &quot; My philosophy : No pain , no pain . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
( Applause )
So I work in marketing , which I love , but my first passion was physics , a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher , when I had a little less gray hair .
So he taught me that physics is cool because it teaches us so much about the world around us .
And I &apos;m going to spend the next few minutes trying to convince you that physics can teach us something about marketing .
So quick show of hands — who studied some marketing in university ?
Who studied some physics in university ?
Pretty good . And at school ?
Okay , lots of you .
So , hopefully this will bring back some happy , or possibly some slightly disturbing memories .
So , physics and marketing .
We &apos;ll start with something very simple — Newton &apos;s Law : &quot; The force equals mass times acceleration . &quot;
This is something that perhaps Turkish Airlines should have studied a bit more carefully before they ran this campaign .
( Laughter ) But if we rearrange this formula quickly , we can get to acceleration equals force over mass , which means that for a larger particle — a larger mass — it requires more force to change its direction .
It &apos;s the same with brands : the more massive a brand , the more baggage it has , the more force is needed to change its positioning .
And that &apos;s one of the reasons why Arthur Andersen chose to launch Accenture rather than try to persuade the world that Andersen &apos;s could stand for something other than accountancy .
It explains why Hoover found it very difficult to persuade the world that it was more than vacuum cleaners , and why companies like Unilever and P &amp; G keep brands separate , like Ariel and Pringles and Dove rather than having one giant parent brand .
So the physics is that the bigger the mass of an object the more force is needed to change its direction .
The marketing is , the bigger a brand , the more difficult it is to reposition it .
So think about a portfolio of brands or maybe new brands for new ventures .
Now , who remembers Heisenberg &apos;s uncertainty principle ?
Getting a little more technical now .
So this says that it &apos;s impossible , by definition , to measure exactly the state — i.e. , the position — and the momentum of a particle , because the act of measuring it , by definition , changes it .
So to explain that — if you &apos;ve got an elementary particle and you shine a light on it , then the photon of light has momentum , which knocks the particle , so you don &apos;t know where it was before you looked at it .
By measuring it , the act of measurement changes it .
The act of observation changes it .
It &apos;s the same in marketing .
So with the act of observing consumers , changes their behavior .
Think about the group of moms who are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group , and almost none of them buy lots of junk food .
And yet , McDonald &apos;s sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year .
Think about the people who are on accompanied shops in supermarkets , who stuff their trolleys full of fresh green vegetables and fruit , but don &apos;t shop like that any other day .
And if you think about the number of people who claim in surveys to regularly look for porn on the Web , it &apos;s very few .
Yet , at Google , we know it &apos;s the number-one searched for category .
So luckily , the science — no , sorry — the marketing is getting easier .
Luckily , with now better point-of-sale tracking , more digital media consumption , you can measure more what consumers actually do , rather than what they say they do .
So the physics is you can never accurately and exactly measure a particle , because the observation changes it .
The marketing is — the message for marketing is — that try to measure what consumers actually do , rather than what they say they &apos;ll do or anticipate they &apos;ll do .
So next , the scientific method — an axiom of physics , of all science — says you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation , you can only disprove it .
What this means is you can gather more and more data around a hypothesis or a positioning , and it will strengthen it , but it will not conclusively prove it .
And only one contrary data point can blow your theory out of the water .
So if we take an example — Ptolemy had dozens of data points to support his theory that the planets would rotate around the Earth .
It only took one robust observation from Copernicus to blow that idea out of the water .
And there are parallels for marketing — you can invest for a long time in a brand , but a single contrary observation of that positioning will destroy consumers &apos; belief .
Take BP — they spent millions of pounds over many years building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand , but then one little accident .
Think about Toyota .
It was , for a long time , revered as the most reliable of cars , and then they had the big recall incident .
And Tiger Woods , for a long time , the perfect brand ambassador .
Well , you know the story .
( Laughter ) So the physics is that you cannot prove a hypothesis , but it &apos;s easy to disprove it — any hypothesis is shaky .
And the marketing is that not matter how much you &apos;ve invested in your brand , one bad week can undermine decades of good work .
So be really careful to try and avoid the screw-ups that can undermine your brand .
And lastly , to the slightly obscure world of entropy — the second law of thermodynamics .
This says that entropy , which is a measure of the disorder of a system , will always increase .
The same is true of marketing .
If we go back 20 years , the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager could pretty much define a brand .
But where we are today , things have changed .
You can get a strong brand image or a message and put it out there like the Conservative Party did earlier this year with their election poster .
But then you lose control of it .
With the kind of digital comment creation and distribution tools that are available now to every consumer , it &apos;s impossible to control where it goes .
Your brand starts being dispersed , ( Laughter ) it gets more chaotic . ( Laughter )
It &apos;s out of your control . ( Laughter )
I actually saw him speak — he did a good job .
But while this may be unsettling for marketers , it &apos;s actually a good thing .
This distribution of brand energy gets your brand closer to the people , more in with the people .
It makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force , which is ultimately good for your brand .
So , the lesson from physics is that entropy will always increase ; it &apos;s a fundamental law .
The message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed .
You can &apos;t fight it , so embrace it and find a way to work with it .
So to close , my teacher , Mr. Vutter , told me that physics is cool , and hopefully , I &apos;ve convinced you that physics can teach all of us , even in the world of marketing , something special .
Thank you .

This is a work in process , based on some comments that were made at TED two years ago about the need for the storage of vaccine .
( Music ) ( Video ) Narrator : On this planet , 1.6 billion people don &apos;t have access to electricity , refrigeration or stored fuels .
This is a problem .
It impacts : the spread of disease , the storage of food and medicine and the quality of life .
So here &apos;s the plan : inexpensive refrigeration that doesn &apos;t use electricity , propane , gas , kerosene or consumables .
Time for some thermodynamics .
And the story of the Intermittent Absorption Refrigerator .
Adam Grosser : So 29 years ago , I had this thermo teacher who talked about absorption and refrigeration .
It &apos;s one of those things that stuck in my head .
It was a lot like the Stirling engine : it was cool , but you didn &apos;t know what to do with it .
And it was invented in 1858 , by this guy Ferdinand Carre , but he couldn &apos;t actually build anything with it because of the tools of the time .
This crazy Canadian named Powel Crosley commercialized this thing called the IcyBall in 1928 , and it was a really neat idea , and I &apos;ll get to why it didn &apos;t work , but here &apos;s how it works .
There &apos;s two spheres and they &apos;re separated in distance .
One has a working fluid , water and ammonia , and the other is a condenser .
You heat up one side , the hot side .
The ammonia evaporates and it re-condenses in the other side .
You let it cool to room temperature , and then , as the ammonia re-evaporates and combines with the water back on the erstwhile hot side , it creates a powerful cooling effect .
So , it was a great idea that didn &apos;t work at all : it blew up .
Because using ammonia you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong .
It topped 400 psi . The ammonia was toxic . It sprayed everywhere .
But it was kind of an interesting thought .
So , the great thing about 2006 is there &apos;s a lot of really great computational work you can do .
So , we got the whole thermodynamics department at Stanford involved — a lot of computational fluid dynamics .
We proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong .
We found some non-toxic refrigerants that worked at very low vapor pressures .
Brought in a team from the U.K. — there &apos;s a lot of great refrigeration people , it turned out , in the U.K. — and built a test rig , and proved that , in fact , we could make a low pressure , non-toxic refrigerator .
So , this is the way it works .
You put it on a cooking fire .
Most people have cooking fires in the world , whether it &apos;s camel dung or wood .
It heats up for about 30 minutes , cools for an hour .
Put it into a container and it will refrigerate for 24 hours .
It looks like this . This is the fifth prototype . It &apos;s not quite done .
Weighs about eight pounds , and this is the way it works .
You put it into a 15-liter vessel , about three gallons , and it &apos;ll cool it down to just above freezing — three degrees above freezing — for 24 hours in a 30 degree C environment . It &apos;s really cheap .
We think we can build these in high volumes for about 25 dollars , in low volumes for about 40 dollars .
And we think we can make refrigeration something that everybody can have .
Thank you .

We are going to take a quick voyage over the cognitive history of the 20th century , because during that century , our minds have altered dramatically .
As you all know , the cars that people drove in 1900 have altered because the roads are better and because of technology .
And our minds have altered , too .
We &apos;ve gone from people who confronted a concrete world and analyzed that world primarily in terms of how much it would benefit them to people who confront a very complex world , and it &apos;s a world where we &apos;ve had to develop new mental habits , new habits of mind .
And these include things like clothing that concrete world with classification , introducing abstractions that we try to make logically consistent , and also taking the hypothetical seriously , that is , wondering about what might have been rather than what is .
Now , this dramatic change was drawn to my attention through massive I.Q. gains over time , and these have been truly massive .
That is , we don &apos;t just get a few more questions right on I.Q. tests .
We get far more questions right on I.Q. tests than each succeeding generation back to the time that they were invented .
Indeed , if you score the people a century ago against modern norms , they would have an average I.Q. of 70 .
If you score us against their norms , we would have an average I.Q. of 130 .
Now this has raised all sorts of questions .
Were our immediate ancestors on the verge of mental retardation ?
Because 70 is normally the score for mental retardation .
Or are we on the verge of all being gifted ?
Because 130 is the cutting line for giftedness .
Now I &apos;m going to try and argue for a third alternative that &apos;s much more illuminating than either of those , and to put this into perspective , let &apos;s imagine that a Martian came down to Earth and found a ruined civilization .
And this Martian was an archaeologist , and they found scores , target scores , that people had used for shooting .
And first they looked at 1865 , and they found that in a minute , people had only put one bullet in the bullseye .
And then they found , in 1898 , that they &apos;d put about five bullets in the bullseye in a minute .
And then about 1918 they put a hundred bullets in the bullseye .
And initially , that archaeologist would be baffled .
They would say , look , these tests were designed to find out how much people were steady of hand , how keen their eyesight was , whether they had control of their weapon .
How could these performances have escalated to this enormous degree ?
Well we now know , of course , the answer .
If that Martian looked at battlefields , they would find that people had only muskets at the time of the Civil War and that they had repeating rifles at the time of the Spanish-American War , and then they had machine guns by the time of World War I.
And , in other words , it was the equipment that was in the hands of the average soldier that was responsible , not greater keenness of eye or steadiness of hand .
Now what we have to imagine is the mental artillery that we have picked up over those hundred years , and I think again that another thinker will help us here , and that &apos;s Luria .
Luria looked at people just before they entered the scientific age , and he found that these people were resistant to classifying the concrete world .
They wanted to break it up into little bits that they could use .
He found that they were resistant to deducing the hypothetical , to speculating about what might be , and he found finally that they didn &apos;t deal well with abstractions or using logic on those abstractions .
Now let me give you a sample of some of his interviews .
He talked to the head man of a person in rural Russia .
They &apos;d only had , as people had in 1900 , about four years of schooling .
And he asked that particular person , what do crows and fish have in common ?
And the fellow said , &quot; &quot; Absolutely nothing .
You know , I can eat a fish . I can &apos;t eat a crow .
A crow can peck at a fish .
A fish can &apos;t do anything to a crow . &quot; &quot; And Luria said , &quot; &quot; But aren &apos;t they both animals ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Of course not .
One &apos;s a fish .
The other is a bird . &quot; &quot; And he was interested , effectively , in what he could do with those concrete objects .
And then Luria went to another person , and he said to them , &quot; &quot; There are no camels in Germany .
Hamburg is a city in Germany .
Are there camels in Hamburg ? &quot; &quot; And the fellow said , &quot; Well , if it &apos;s large enough , there ought to be camels there . &quot;
And Luria said , &quot; &quot; But what do my words imply ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , maybe it &apos;s a small village , and there &apos;s no room for camels . &quot; &quot; In other words , he was unwilling to treat this as anything but a concrete problem , and he was used to camels being in villages , and he was quite unable to use the hypothetical , to ask himself what if there were no camels in Germany .
A third interview was conducted with someone about the North Pole .
And Luria said , &quot; &quot; At the North Pole , there is always snow .
Wherever there is always snow , the bears are white .
What color are the bears at the North Pole ? &quot; &quot; And the response was , &quot; &quot; Such a thing is to be settled by testimony .
If a wise person came from the North Pole and told me the bears were white , I might believe him , but every bear that I have seen is a brown bear . &quot; &quot; Now you see again , this person has rejected going beyond the concrete world and analyzing it through everyday experience , and it was important to that person what color bears were — that is , they had to hunt bears .
They weren &apos;t willing to engage in this .
One of them said to Luria , &quot; &quot; How can we solve things that aren &apos;t real problems ?
None of these problems are real .
How can we address them ? &quot; &quot; Now , these three categories — classification , using logic on abstractions , taking the hypothetical seriously — how much difference do they make in the real world beyond the testing room ?
And let me give you a few illustrations .
First , almost all of us today get a high school diploma .
That is , we &apos;ve gone from four to eight years of education to 12 years of formal education , and 52 percent of Americans have actually experienced some type of tertiary education .
Now , not only do we have much more education , and much of that education is scientific , and you can &apos;t do science without classifying the world .
You can &apos;t do science without proposing hypotheses .
You can &apos;t do science without making it logically consistent .
And even down in grade school , things have changed .
In 1910 , they looked at the examinations that the state of Ohio gave to 14-year-olds , and they found that they were all for socially valued concrete information .
They were things like , what are the capitals of the 44 or 45 states that existed at that time ?
When they looked at the exams that the state of Ohio gave in 1990 , they were all about abstractions .
They were things like , why is the largest city of a state rarely the capital ?
And you were supposed to think , well , the state legislature was rural-controlled , and they hated the big city , so rather than putting the capital in a big city , they put it in a county seat .
They put it in Albany rather than New York .
They put it in Harrisburg rather than Philadelphia .
And so forth .
So the tenor of education has changed .
We are educating people to take the hypothetical seriously , to use abstractions , and to link them logically .
What about employment ?
Well , in 1900 , three percent of Americans practiced professions that were cognitively demanding .
Only three percent were lawyers or doctors or teachers .
Today , 35 percent of Americans practice cognitively demanding professions , not only to the professions proper like lawyer or doctor or scientist or lecturer , but many , many sub-professions having to do with being a technician , a computer programmer .
A whole range of professions now make cognitive demands .
And we can only meet the terms of employment in the modern world by being cognitively far more flexible .
And it &apos;s not just that we have many more people in cognitively demanding professions .
The professions have been upgraded .
Compare the doctor in 1900 , who really had only a few tricks up his sleeve , with the modern general practitioner or specialist , with years of scientific training .
Compare the banker in 1900 , who really just needed a good accountant and to know who was trustworthy in the local community for paying back their mortgage .
Well , the merchant bankers who brought the world to their knees may have been morally remiss , but they were cognitively very agile .
They went far beyond that 1900 banker .
They had to look at computer projections for the housing market .
They had to get complicated CDO-squared in order to bundle debt together and make debt look as if it were actually a profitable asset .
They had to prepare a case to get rating agencies to give it a AAA , though in many cases , they had virtually bribed the rating agencies .
And they also , of course , had to get people to accept these so-called assets and pay money for them even though they were highly vulnerable .
Or take a farmer today .
I take the farm manager of today as very different from the farmer of 1900 .
So it hasn &apos;t just been the spread of cognitively demanding professions .
It &apos;s also been the upgrading of tasks like lawyer and doctor and what have you that have made demands on our cognitive faculties .
But I &apos;ve talked about education and employment .
Some of the habits of mind that we have developed over the 20th century have paid off in unexpected areas .
I &apos;m primarily a moral philosopher .
I merely have a holiday in psychology , and what interests me in general is moral debate .
Now over the last century , in developed nations like America , moral debate has escalated because we take the hypothetical seriously , and we also take universals seriously and look for logical connections .
When I came home in 1955 from university at the time of Martin Luther King , a lot of people came home at that time and started having arguments with their parents and grandparents .
My father was born in 1885 , and he was mildly racially biased .
As an Irishman , he hated the English so much he didn &apos;t have much emotion for anyone else .
( Laughter ) But he did have a sense that black people were inferior .
And when we said to our parents and grandparents , &quot; How would you feel if tomorrow morning you woke up black ? &quot;
they said that is the dumbest thing you &apos;ve ever said .
Who have you ever known who woke up in the morning — ( Laughter ) — that turned black ?
In other words , they were fixed in the concrete mores and attitudes they had inherited .
They would not take the hypothetical seriously , and without the hypothetical , it &apos;s very difficult to get moral argument off the ground .
You have to say , imagine you were in Iran , and imagine that your relatives all suffered from collateral damage even though they had done no wrong .
How would you feel about that ?
And if someone of the older generation says , well , our government takes care of us , and it &apos;s up to their government to take care of them , they &apos;re just not willing to take the hypothetical seriously .
Or take an Islamic father whose daughter has been raped , and he feels he &apos;s honor-bound to kill her .
Well , he &apos;s treating his mores as if they were sticks and stones and rocks that he had inherited , and they &apos;re unmovable in any way by logic .
They &apos;re just inherited mores .
Today we would say something like , well , imagine you were knocked unconscious and sodomized .
Would you deserve to be killed ?
And he would say , well that &apos;s not in the Koran .
That &apos;s not one of the principles I &apos;ve got .
Well you , today , universalize your principles .
You state them as abstractions and you use logic on them .
If you have a principle such as , people shouldn &apos;t suffer unless they &apos;re guilty of something , then to exclude black people you &apos;ve got to make exceptions , don &apos;t you ?
You have to say , well , blackness of skin , you couldn &apos;t suffer just for that .
It must be that blacks are somehow tainted .
And then we can bring empirical evidence to bear , can &apos;t we , and say , well how can you consider all blacks tainted when St. Augustine was black and Thomas Sowell is black .
And you can get moral argument off the ground , then , because you &apos;re not treating moral principles as concrete entities .
You &apos;re treating them as universals , to be rendered consistent by logic .
Now how did all of this arise out of I.Q. tests ?
That &apos;s what initially got me going on cognitive history .
If you look at the I.Q. test , you find the gains have been greatest in certain areas .
The similarities subtest of the Wechsler is about classification , and we have made enormous gains on that classification subtest .
There are other parts of the I.Q. test battery that are about using logic on abstractions .
Some of you may have taken Raven &apos;s Progressive Matrices , and it &apos;s all about analogies .
And in 1900 , people could do simple analogies .
That is , if you said to them , cats are like wildcats .
What are dogs like ?
They would say wolves .
But by 1960 , people could attack Raven &apos;s on a much more sophisticated level .
If you said , we &apos;ve got two squares followed by a triangle , what follows two circles ?
They could say a semicircle .
Just as a triangle is half of a square , a semicircle is half of a circle .
By 2010 , college graduates , if you said two circles followed by a semicircle , two sixteens followed by what , they would say eight , because eight is half of 16 .
That is , they had moved so far from the concrete world that they could even ignore the appearance of the symbols that were involved in the question .
Now , I should say one thing that &apos;s very disheartening .
We haven &apos;t made progress on all fronts .
One of the ways in which we would like to deal with the sophistication of the modern world is through politics , and sadly you can have humane moral principles , you can classify , you can use logic on abstractions , and if you &apos;re ignorant of history and of other countries , you can &apos;t do politics .
We &apos;ve noticed , in a trend among young Americans , that they read less history and less literature and less material about foreign lands , and they &apos;re essentially ahistorical .
They live in the bubble of the present .
They don &apos;t know the Korean War from the war in Vietnam .
They don &apos;t know who was an ally of America in World War II .
Think how different America would be if every American knew that this is the fifth time Western armies have gone to Afghanistan to put its house in order , and if they had some idea of exactly what had happened on those four previous occasions .
( Laughter ) And that is , they had barely left , and there wasn &apos;t a trace in the sand .
Or imagine how different things would be if most Americans knew that we had been lied into four of our last six wars .
You know , the Spanish didn &apos;t sink the battleship Maine , the Lusitania was not an innocent vessel but was loaded with munitions , the North Vietnamese did not attack the Seventh Fleet , and , of course , Saddam Hussein hated al Qaeda and had nothing to do with it , and yet the administration convinced 45 percent of the people that they were brothers in arms , when he would hang one from the nearest lamppost .
But I don &apos;t want to end on a pessimistic note .
The 20th century has shown enormous cognitive reserves in ordinary people that we have now realized , and the aristocracy was convinced that the average person couldn &apos;t make it , that they could never share their mindset or their cognitive abilities .
Lord Curzon once said he saw people bathing in the North Sea , and he said , &quot; &quot; Why did no one tell me what white bodies the lower orders have ? &quot; &quot; As if they were a reptile .
Well , Dickens was right and he was wrong . &#91; Correction : Rudyard Kipling &#93; &#91; Kipling &#93; said , &quot; &quot; The colonel &apos;s lady and Judy O &apos;Grady are sisters underneath the skin . &quot; &quot; ( Applause )
I &apos;d like to ask you , what do these three people have in common ?
Well , you probably recognize the first person .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re all avid &quot; &quot; American Idol &quot; &quot; watchers .
But you might not recognize Aydah Al Jahani , who is a contestant , indeed a finalist , in the Poet of the Millions competition , which is broadcast out of Abu Dhabi , and seen throughout the Arab world .
In this contest people have to write and recite original poetry , in the Nabati form of poetry , which is the traditional Bedouin form .
And Lima Sahar was a finalist in the Afghan Star singing competition .
Now , before I go any further , yes , I know it all began with &quot; &quot; Britain &apos;s Got Talent . &quot; &quot; But my point in discussing this is to show you — I hope I &apos;ll be able to show you how these merit-based competitions , with equal access to everyone , with the winner selected via voting by SMS , are changing tribal societies .
And I &apos;m going to focus on Afghanistan and the Arab world with the UAE , how they &apos;re changing tribal societies , not by introducing Western ideas , but by being integrated into the language in those places .
It all begins with enjoyment .
Video : We are late to watch &quot; &quot; Afghan Star . &quot; &quot; We are going to watch &quot; &quot; Afghan Star . &quot; &quot; We are late .
We are running late .
We must go to watch &quot; &quot; Afghan Star . &quot; &quot; Cynthia Schneider : These programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society .
In Afghanistan , people go to extraordinary lengths to be able to watch this program .
And you don &apos;t necessarily have to have your own TV set .
People watch it all over the country also in public places .
But it goes beyond watching , because also , part of this is campaigning .
People become so engaged that they have volunteers , just like political volunteers anyway , who fan out over the countryside , campaigning for their candidate .
Contestants also put themselves forward .
Now , of course there is a certain degree of ethnic allegiance , but not entirely .
Because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group .
This has opened up the door , particularly for women .
And in the last season there were two women in the finalists .
One of them , Lima Sahar , is a Pashtun from Kandahar , a very conservative part of the country .
And here she relates , in the documentary film &quot; &quot; Afghan Star , &quot; &quot; how her friends urged her not to do this and told her that she was leaving them for democracy .
But she also confides that she knows that members of the Taliban are actually SMS-ing votes in for her .
Aydah Al Jahnani also took risks and put herself out , to compete in the Poet of the Millions competition .
I have to say , her husband backed her from the start .
But her tribe and family urged her not to compete and were very much against it .
But , once she started to win , then they got behind her again .
It turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value .
And she &apos;s out there .
Her poetry is about women , and the life of women in society .
So just by presenting herself and being in competition with men — this shows the voting on the program — it sets a very important example for young women — these are young women in the audience of the program — in Abu Dhabi , but also people in the viewing audience .
Now you &apos;d think that &quot; &quot; American Idol &quot; &quot; would introduce a measure of Americanization .
But actually , just the opposite is happening .
By using this engaging popular format for traditional , local culture , it actually , in the Gulf , is precipitating a revival of interest in Nabati poetry , also in traditional dress and dance and music .
And for Afghanistan , where the Taliban banned music for many years , it is reintroducing their traditional music .
They don &apos;t sing pop songs , they sing Afghan music .
And they also have learned how to lose gracefully , without avenging the winner .
( Laughter ) No small thing .
And the final , sort of , formulation of this &quot; &quot; American Idol &quot; &quot; format , which has just appeared in Afghanistan , is a new program called &quot; &quot; The Candidate . &quot; &quot; And in this program , people present policy platforms that are then voted on .
Many of them are too young to run for president , but by putting the issues out there , they are influencing the presidential race .
So for me , the substance of things unseen is how reality TV is driving reality .
Thank you .

I first became fascinated with octopus at an early age .
I grew up in Mobile , Alabama — somebody &apos;s got to be from Mobile , right ? — and Mobile sits at the confluence of five rivers , forming this beautiful delta .
And the delta has alligators crawling in and out of rivers filled with fish and cypress trees dripping with snakes , birds of every flavor .
It &apos;s an absolute magical wonderland to live in — if you &apos;re a kid interested in animals , to grow up in .
And this delta water flows to Mobile Bay , and finally into the Gulf of Mexico .
And I remember my first real contact with octopus was probably at age five or six .
I was in the gulf , and I was swimming around and saw a little octopus on the bottom .
And I reached down and picked him up , and immediately became fascinated and impressed by its speed and its strength and agility .
It was prying my fingers apart and moving to the back of my hand .
It was all I could do to hold onto this amazing creature .
Then it sort of calmed down in the palms of my hands and started flashing colors , just pulsing all of these colors .
And as I looked at it , it kind of tucked its arms under it , raised into a spherical shape and turned chocolate brown with two white stripes .
I &apos;m going , &quot; &quot; My gosh ! &quot; &quot; I had never seen anything like this in my life !
So I marveled for a moment , and then decided it was time to release him , so I put him down .
The octopus left my hands and then did the damnedest thing : It landed on the bottom in the rubble and — fwoosh ! — vanished right before my eyes .
And I knew , right then , at age six , that is an animal that I want to learn more about . So I did .
And I went off to college and got a degree in marine zoology , and then moved to Hawaii and entered graduate school at the University of Hawaii .
And while a student at Hawaii , I worked at the Waikiki Aquarium .
And the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanks but not a lot of invertebrate displays , and being the spineless guy , I thought , well I &apos;ll just go out in the field and collect these wonderful animals I had been learning about as a student and bring them in , and I built these elaborate sets and put them on display .
Now , the fish in the tanks were gorgeous to look at , but they didn &apos;t really interact with people .
But the octopus did .
If you walked up to an octopus tank , especially early in the morning before anyone arrived , the octopus would rise up and look at you and you &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; Is that guy really looking at me ? He is looking at me ! &quot; &quot; And you walk up to the front of the tank . Then you realize that these animals all have different personalities : Some of them would hold their ground , others would slink into the back of the tank and disappear in the rocks , and one in particular , this amazing animal ...
I went up to the front of the tank , and he &apos;s just staring at me , and he had little horns come up above his eyes .
So I went right up to the front of the tank — I was three or four inches from the front glass — and the octopus was sitting on a perch , a little rock , and he came off the rock and he also came down right to the front of the glass .
So I was staring at this animal about six or seven inches away , and at that time I could actually focus that close ; now as I look at my fuzzy fingers I realize those days are long gone .
Anyway , there we were , staring at each other , and he reaches down and grabs an armful of gravel and releases it in the jet of water entering the tank from the filtration system , and — chk chk chk chk chk ! — this gravel hits the front of the glass and falls down .
He reaches up , takes another armful of gravel , releases it — chk chk chk chk chk ! — same thing .
Then he lifts another arm and I lift an arm .
Then he lifts another arm and I lift another arm .
And then I realize the octopus won the arms race , because I was out and he had six left . ( Laughter ) But the only way I can describe what I was seeing that day was that this octopus was playing , which is a pretty sophisticated behavior for a mere invertebrate .
So , about three years into my degree , a funny thing happened on the way to the office , which actually changed the course of my life .
A man came into the aquarium . It &apos;s a long story , but essentially he sent me and a couple of friends of mine to the South Pacific to collect animals for him , and as we left , he gave us two 16-millimeter movie cameras .
He said , &quot; &quot; Make a movie about this expedition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK , a couple of biologists making a movie — this &apos;ll be interesting , &quot; &quot; and off we went . And we did , we made a movie , which had to be the worst movie ever made in the history of movie making , but it was a blast . I had so much fun .
And I remember that proverbial light going off in my head , thinking , &quot; &quot; Wait a minute .
Maybe I can do this all the time .
Yeah , I &apos;ll be a filmmaker . &quot; &quot; So I literally came back from that job , quit school , hung my filmmaking shingle and just never told anyone that I didn &apos;t know what I was doing .
It &apos;s been a good ride .
And what I learned in school though was really beneficial .
If you &apos;re a wildlife filmmaker and you &apos;re going out into the field to film animals , especially behavior , it helps to have a fundamental background on who these animals are , how they work and , you know , a bit about their behaviors .
But where I really learned about octopus was in the field , as a filmmaker making films with them , where you &apos;re allowed to spend large periods of time with the animals , seeing octopus being octopus in their ocean homes .
I remember I took a trip to Australia , went to an island called One Tree Island .
And apparently , evolution had occurred at a pretty rapid rate on One Tree , between the time they named it and the time I arrived , because I &apos;m sure there were at least three trees on that island when we were there .
Anyway , one tree is situated right next to a beautiful coral reef .
In fact , there &apos;s a surge channel where the tide is moving back and forth , twice a day , pretty rapidly .
And there &apos;s a beautiful reef , very complex reef , with lots of animals , including a lot of octopus .
And not uniquely but certainly , the octopus in Australia are masters at camouflage .
As a matter of fact , there &apos;s one right there .
So our first challenge was to find these things , and that was a challenge , indeed .
But the idea is , we were there for a month and I wanted to acclimate the animals to us so that we could see behaviors without disturbing them .
So the first week was pretty much spent just getting as close as we could , every day a little closer , a little closer , a little closer .
And you knew what the limit was : they would start getting twitchy and you &apos;d back up , come back in a few hours .
And after the first week , they ignored us .
It was like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what that thing is , but he &apos;s no threat to me . &quot; &quot; So they went on about their business and from a foot away , we &apos;re watching mating and courting and fighting and it is just an unbelievable experience .
And one of the most fantastic displays that I remember , or at least visually , was a foraging behavior .
And they had a lot of different techniques that they would use for foraging , but this particular one used vision .
And they would see a coral head , maybe 10 feet away , and start moving over toward that coral head .
And I don &apos;t know whether they actually saw crab in it , or imagined that one might be , but whatever the case , they would leap off the bottom and go through the water and land right on top of this coral head , and then the web between the arms would completely engulf the coral head , and they would fish out , swim for crabs .
And as soon as the crabs touched the arm , it was lights out .
And I always wondered what happened under that web .
So we created a way to find out , ( Laughter ) and I got my first look at that famous beak in action .
It was fantastic .
If you &apos;re going to make a lot of films about a particular group of animals , you might as well pick one that &apos;s fairly common .
And octopus are , they live in all the oceans .
They also live deep .
And I can &apos;t say octopus are responsible for my really strong interest in getting in subs and going deep , but whatever the case , I like that .
It &apos;s like nothing you &apos;ve ever done .
If you ever really want to get away from it all and see something that you have never seen , and have an excellent chance of seeing something no one has ever seen , get in a sub .
You climb in , seal the hatch , turn on a little oxygen , turn on the scrubber , which removes the CO2 in the air you breathe , and they chuck you overboard .
Down you go . There &apos;s no connection to the surface apart from a pretty funky radio .
And as you go down , the washing machine at the surface calms down .
And it gets quiet .
And it starts getting really nice .
And as you go deeper , that lovely , blue water you were launched in gives way to darker and darker blue .
And finally , it &apos;s a rich lavender , and after a couple of thousand feet , it &apos;s ink black .
And now you &apos;ve entered the realm of the mid-water community .
You could give an entire talk about the creatures that live in the mid-water .
Suffice to say though , as far as I &apos;m concerned , without question , the most bizarre designs and outrageous behaviors are in the animals that live in the mid-water community .
But we &apos;re just going to zip right past this area , this area that includes about 95 percent of the living space on our planet and go to the mid-ocean ridge , which I think is even more extraordinary .
The mid-ocean ridge is a huge mountain range , 40,000 miles long , snaking around the entire globe .
And they &apos;re big mountains , thousands of feet tall , some of which are tens of thousands of feet and bust through the surface , creating islands like Hawaii .
And the top of this mountain range is splitting apart , creating a rift valley .
And when you dive into that rift valley , that &apos;s where the action is because literally thousands of active volcanoes are going off at any point in time all along this 40,000 mile range .
And as these tectonic plates are spreading apart , magma , lava is coming up and filling those gaps , and you &apos;re looking land — new land — being created right before your eyes .
And over the tops of them is 3,000 to 4,000 meters of water creating enormous pressure , forcing water down through the cracks toward the center of the earth , until it hits a magma chamber where it becomes superheated and supersaturated with minerals , reverses its flow and starts shooting back to the surface and is ejected out of the earth like a geyser at Yellowstone .
In fact , this whole area is like a Yellowstone National Park with all of the trimmings .
And this vent fluid is about 600 or 700 degrees F.
The surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing .
So it immediately cools , and it can no longer hold in suspension all of the material that it &apos;s dissolved , and it precipitates out , forming black smoke .
And it forms these towers , these chimneys that are 10 , 20 , 30 feet tall .
And all along the sides of these chimneys is shimmering with heat and loaded with life .
You &apos;ve got black smokers going all over the place and chimneys that have tube worms that might be eight to 10 feet long .
And out of the tops of these tube worms are these beautiful red plumes .
And living amongst the tangle of tube worms is an entire community of animals : shrimp , fish , lobsters , crab , clams and swarms of arthropods that are playing that dangerous game between over here is scalding hot and freezing cold .
And this whole ecosystem wasn &apos;t even known about until 33 years ago .
And it completely threw science on its head .
It made scientists rethink where life on Earth might have actually begun .
And before the discovery of these vents , all life on Earth , the key to life on Earth , was believed to be the sun and photosynthesis .
But down there , there is no sun , there is no photosynthesis ; it &apos;s chemosynthetic environment down there driving it , and it &apos;s all so ephemeral .
You might film this unbelievable hydrothermal vent , which you think at the time has to be on another planet .
It &apos;s amazing to think that this is actually on earth ; it looks like aliens in an alien environment .
But you go back to the same vent eight years later and it can be completely dead .
There &apos;s no hot water .
All of the animals are gone , they &apos;re dead , and the chimneys are still there creating a really nice ghost town , an eerie , spooky ghost town , but essentially devoid of animals , of course .
But 10 miles down the ridge ...
pshhh ! There &apos;s another volcano going .
And there &apos;s a whole new hydrothermal vent community that has been formed .
And this kind of life and death of hydrothermal vent communities is going on every 30 or 40 years all along the ridge .
And that ephemeral nature of the hydrothermal vent community isn &apos;t really different from some of the areas that I &apos;ve seen in 35 years of traveling around , making films .
Where you go and film a really nice sequence at a bay .
And you go back , and I &apos;m at home , and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Okay , what can I shoot ...
Ah ! I know where I can shoot that .
There &apos;s this beautiful bay , lots of soft corals and stomatopods . &quot; &quot; And you show up , and it &apos;s dead .
There &apos;s no coral , algae growing on it , and the water &apos;s pea soup .
You think , &quot; &quot; Well , what happened ? &quot; &quot; And you turn around , and there &apos;s a hillside behind you with a neighborhood going in , and bulldozers are pushing piles of soil back and forth .
And over here there &apos;s a golf course going in .
And this is the tropics .
It &apos;s raining like crazy here .
So this rainwater is flooding down the hillside , carrying with it sediments from the construction site , smothering the coral and killing it .
And fertilizers and pesticides are flowing into the bay from the golf course — the pesticides killing all the larvae and little animals , fertilizer creating this beautiful plankton bloom — and there &apos;s your pea soup .
But , encouragingly , I &apos;ve seen just the opposite .
I &apos;ve been to a place that was a pretty trashed bay .
And I looked at it , just said , &quot; &quot; Yuck , &quot; &quot; and go and work on the other side of the island .
Five years later , come back , and that same bay is now gorgeous . It &apos;s beautiful .
It &apos;s got living coral , fish all over the place , crystal clear water , and you go , &quot; &quot; How did that happen ? &quot; &quot; Well , how it happened is the local community galvanized .
They recognized what was happening on the hillside and put a stop to it ; enacted laws and made permits required to do responsible construction and golf course maintenance and stopped the sediments flowing into the bay , and stopped the chemicals flowing into the bay , and the bay recovered .
The ocean has an amazing ability to recover , if we &apos;ll just leave it alone .
I think Margaret Mead said it best .
She said that a small group of thoughtful people could change the world .
Indeed , it &apos;s the only thing that ever has .
And a small group of thoughtful people changed that bay .
I &apos;m a big fan of grassroots organizations .
I &apos;ve been to a lot of lectures where , at the end of it , inevitably , one of the first questions that comes up is , &quot; &quot; But , but what can I do ?
I &apos;m an individual . I &apos;m one person .
And these problems are so large and global , and it &apos;s just overwhelming . &quot; &quot; Fair enough question .
My answer to that is don &apos;t look at the big , overwhelming issues of the world .
Look in your own backyard .
Look in your heart , actually .
What do you really care about that isn &apos;t right where you live ?
And fix it .
Create a healing zone in your neighborhood and encourage others to do the same .
And maybe these healing zones can sprinkle a map , little dots on a map .
And in fact , the way that we can communicate today — where Alaska is instantly knowing what &apos;s going on in China , and the Kiwis did this , and then over in England they tried to ...
and everybody is talking to everyone else — it &apos;s not isolated points on a map anymore , it &apos;s a network we &apos;ve created .
And maybe these healing zones can start growing , and possibly even overlap , and good things can happen .
So that &apos;s how I answer that question .
Look in your own backyard , in fact , look in the mirror .
What can you do that is more responsible than what you &apos;re doing now ?
And do that , and spread the word .
The vent community animals can &apos;t really do much about the life and death that &apos;s going on where they live , but up here we can .
In theory , we &apos;re thinking , rational human beings .
And we can make changes to our behavior that will influence and affect the environment , like those people changed the health of that bay .
Now , Sylvia &apos;s TED Prize wish was to beseech us to do anything we could , everything we could , to set aside not pin pricks , but significant expanses of the ocean for preservation , &quot; &quot; hope spots , &quot; &quot; she calls them .
And I applaud that . I loudly applaud that .
And it &apos;s my hope that some of these &quot; &quot; hope spots &quot; &quot; can be in the deep ocean , an area that has historically been seriously neglected , if not abused .
The term &quot; &quot; deep six &quot; &quot; comes to mind : &quot; &quot; If it &apos;s too big or too toxic for a landfill , deep six it ! &quot; &quot; So , I hope that we can also keep some of these &quot; &quot; hope spots &quot; &quot; in the deep sea .
Now , I don &apos;t get a wish , but I certainly can say that I will do anything I can to support Sylvia Earle &apos;s wish .
And that I do .
Thank you very much . ( Applause )
Once upon a time , at the age of 24 , I was a student at St. John &apos;s Medical College in Bangalore .
I was a guest student during one month of a public health course .
And that changed my mindset forever .
The course was good , but it was not the course content in itself that changed the mindset .
It was the brutal realization , the first morning , that the Indian students were better than me .
( Laughter ) You see , I was a study nerd .
I loved statistics from a young age .
And I studied very much in Sweden .
I used to be in the upper quarter of all courses I attended .
But in St. John &apos;s , I was in the lower quarter .
And the fact was that Indian students studied harder than we did in Sweden .
They read the textbook twice , or three times or four times .
In Sweden we read it once and then we went partying .
( Laugher ) And that , to me , that personal experience was the first time in my life that the mindset I grew up with was changed .
And I realized that perhaps the Western world will not continue to dominate the world forever .
And I think many of you have the same sort of personal experience .
It &apos;s that realization of someone you meet that really made you change your ideas about the world .
It &apos;s not the statistics , although I tried to make it funny .
And I will now , here , onstage , try to predict when that will happen — that Asia will regain its dominant position as the leading part of the world , as it used to be , over thousands of years .
And I will do that by trying to predict precisely at what year the average income per person in India , in China , will reach that of the West .
And I don &apos;t mean the whole economy , because to grow an economy of India to the size of U.K. — that &apos;s a piece of cake , with one billion people .
But I want to see when will the average pay , the money for each person , per month , in India and China , when will that have reached that of U.K. and the United States ?
But I will start with a historical background .
And you can see my map if I get it up here . You know ?
I will start at 1858 .
1858 was a year of great technological advancement in the West .
That was the year when Queen Victoria was able , for the first time , to communicate with President Buchanan , through the Transatlantic Telegraphic Cable .
And they were the first to &quot; &quot; Twitter &quot; &quot; transatlantically .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And I &apos;ve been able , through this wonderful Google and Internet , to find the text of the telegram sent back from President Buchanan to Queen Victoria .
And it ends like this : &quot; &quot; This telegraph is a fantastic instrument to diffuse religion , civilization , liberty and law throughout the world . &quot; &quot; Those are nice words . But I got sort of curious of what he meant with liberty , and liberty for whom .
And we will think about that when we look at the wider picture of the world in 1858 .
Because 1858 was also watershed year in the history of Asia .
1858 was the year when the courageous uprising against the foreign occupation of India was defeated by the British forces .
And India was up to 89 years more of foreign domination .
1858 in China was the victory in the Opium War by the British forces .
And that meant that foreigners , as it said in the treaty , were allowed to trade freely in China .
It meant paying with opium for Chinese goods .
And 1858 in Japan was the year when Japan had to sign the Harris Treaty and accept trade on favorable condition for the U.S.
And they were threatened by those black ships there , that had been in Tokyo harbor over the last year .
But , Japan , in contrast to India and China , maintained its national sovereignty .
And let &apos;s see how much difference that can make .
And I will do that by bringing these bubbles back to a Gapminder graph here , where you can see each bubble is a country .
The size of the bubble here is the population .
On this axis , as I used to have income per person in comparable dollar .
And on that axis I have life expectancy , the health of people .
And I also bring an innovation here .
I have transformed the laser beam into an ecological , recyclable version here , in green India .
( Applause ) And we will see , you know .
Look here , 1858 , India was here , China was here , Japan was there , United States and United Kingdom was richer over there .
And I will start the world like this .
India was not always like this level .
Actually if we go back into the historical record , there was a time hundreds of years ago when the income per person in India and China was even above that of Europe .
But 1850 had already been many , many years of foreign domination , and India had been de-industrialized .
And you can see that the countries who were growing their economy was United States and United Kingdom .
And they were also , by the end of the century , getting healthy , and Japan was starting to catch up .
India was trying down here .
Can you see how it starts to move there ?
But really , really natural sovereignty was good for Japan .
And Japan is trying to move up there .
And it &apos;s the new century now . Health is getting better , United Kingdom , United States .
But careful now — we are approaching the First World War .
And the First World War , you know , we &apos;ll see a lot of deaths and economical problems here .
United Kingdom is going down .
And now comes the Spanish flu also .
And then after the First World War , they continue up .
Still under foreign domination , and without sovereignty , India and China are down in the corner .
Not much has happened .
They have grown their population but not much more .
In the 1930 &apos;s now , you can see that Japan is going to a period of war , with lower life expectancy .
And the Second World War was really a terrible event , also economically for Japan .
But they did recover quite fast afterwards .
And we are moving into the new world .
In 1947 India finally gained its independence .
And they could raise the Indian flag and become a sovereign nation , but in very big difficulties down there .
( Applause ) In 1949 we saw the emergence of the modern China in a way which surprised the world .
And what happened ?
What happens in the after independence ?
You can see that the health started to improve .
Children started to go to school .
Health services were provided .
This is the Great Leap Forward , when China fell down .
It was central planning by Mao Tse Tung .
China recovered . Then they said , &quot; Nevermore , stupid central planning . &quot;
But they went up here , and India was trying to follow .
And they were catching up indeed .
And both countries had the better health , but still a very low economy .
And we came to 1978 , and Mao Tse Tung died , and a new guy turned up from the left .
And it was Deng Xiaoping coming out here .
And he said , &quot; &quot; Doesn &apos;t matter if a cat is white or black , as long as it catches mice . &quot; &quot; Because catching mice is what the two cats wanted to do .
And you can see the two cats being here , China and India , wanting to catch the mices over there , you know .
And they decided to go not only for health and education , but also starting to grow their economy .
And the market reformer was successful there .
In &apos; 92 India follows with a market reform .
And they go quite closely together , and you can see that the similarity with India and China , in many ways , are greater than the differences with them .
And here they march on . And will they catch up ?
This is the big question today .
There they are today .
Now what does it mean that the — ( Applause ) the averages there — this is the average of China .
If I would split China , look here , Shanghai has already catched up .
Shanghai is already there .
And it &apos;s healthier than the United States .
But on the other hand , Guizhou , one of the poorest inland provinces of China , is there .
And if I split Guizhou into urban and rural , the rural part of Guizhou goes down there .
You see this enormous inequity in China , in the midst of fast economic growth .
And if I would also look at India , you have another type of inequity , actually , in India .
The geographical , macro-geographical difference is not so big .
Uttar Pradesh , the biggest of the states here , is poorer and has a lower health than the rest of India .
Kerala is flying on top there , matching United States in health , but not in economy .
And here , Maharashtra , with Mumbai , is forging forward .
Now in India , the big inequities are within the state , rather than between the states .
And that is not a bad thing , in itself .
If you have a lot inequity , macro-geographical inequities can be more difficult in the long term to deal with , than if it is in the same area where you have a growth center relatively close to where poor people are living .
No , there is one more inequity . Look there , United States .
( Laughter ) Oh , they broke my frame .
Washington , D.C. went out here .
My friends at Gapminder wanted me to show this because there is a new leader in Washington who is really concerned about the health system .
And I can understand him , because Washington , D.C.
is so rich over there but they are not as healthy as Kerala .
It &apos;s quite interesting , isn &apos;t it ?
( Applause ) I can see a business opportunity for Kerala , helping fix the health system in the United States .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Now here we have the whole world . You have the legend down there .
And when you see the two giant cats here , pushing forward , you see that in between them and ahead of them , is the whole emerging economies of the world , which Thomas Friedman so correctly called the &quot; &quot; flat world . &quot; &quot; You can see that in health and education , a large part of the world population is putting forward , but in Africa , and other parts , as in rural Guizhou in China , there is still people with low health and very low economy .
We have an enormous disparity in the world .
But most of the world in the middle are pushing forwards very fast .
Now , back to my projections .
When will it catch up ? I have to go back to very conventional graph .
I will show income per person on this axis instead , poor down here , rich up there .
And then time here , from 1858 I start the world .
And we shall see what will happen with these countries .
You see , China under foreign domination actually lowered their income and came down to the Indian level here .
Whereas U.K. and United States is getting richer and richer .
And after Second World War , United States is richer than U.K.
But independence is coming here .
Growth is starting , economic reform .
Growth is faster , and with projection from IMF you can see where you expect them to be in 2014 .
Now , the question is , &quot; &quot; When will the catch up take place ? &quot; &quot; Look at , look at the United States .
Can you see the bubble ?
The bubbles , not my bubbles , but the financial bubbles .
That &apos;s the dot com bubble . This is the Lehman Brothers doorstep there .
You see it came down there .
And it seems this is another rock coming down there , you know .
So they doesn &apos;t seem to go this way , these countries .
They seem to go in a more humble growth way , you know .
And people interested in growth are turning their eyes towards Asia .
I can compare to Japan . This is Japan coming up .
You see , Japan did it like that .
We add Japan to it .
And there is no doubt that fast catch up can take place .
Can you see here what Japan did ?
Japan did it like this , until full catch up , and then they follow with the other high-income economies .
But the real projections for those ones , I would like to give it like this .
Can be worse , can be better .
It &apos;s always difficult to predict , especially about the future .
Now , a historian tells me it &apos;s even more difficult to predict about the past .
( Laughter ) I think I &apos;m in a difficult position here .
Inequalities in China and India I consider really the big obstacle because to bring the entire population into growth and prosperity is what will create a domestic market , what will avoid social instability , and which will make use of the entire capacity of the population .
So , social investments in health , education and infrastructure , and electricity is really what is needed in India and China .
You know the climate . We have great international experts within India telling us that the climate is changing , and actions has to be taken , otherwise China and India would be the countries most to suffer from climate change .
And I consider India and China the best partners in the world in a good global climate policy .
But they ain &apos;t going to pay for what others , who have more money , have largely created , and I can agree on that .
But what I &apos;m really worried about is war .
Will the former rich countries really accept a completely changed world economy , and a shift of power away from where it has been the last 50 to 100 to 150 years , back to Asia ?
And will Asia be able to handle that new position of being in charge of being the most mighty , and the governors of the world ?
So , always avoid war , because that always pushes human beings backward .
Now if these inequalities , climate and war can be avoided , get ready for a world in equity , because this is what seems to be happening .
And that vision that I got as a young student , 1972 , that Indians can be much better than Swedes , is just about to happen .
And it will happen precisely the year 2048 in the later part of the summer , in July , more precisely , the 27th of July .
( Applause ) The 27th of July , 2048 is my 100th birthday .
( Laughter ) And I expect to speak in the first session of the 39th TED India .
Get your bookings in time . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The two most likely largest inventions of our generation are the Internet and the mobile phone .
They &apos;ve changed the world .
However , largely to our surprise , they also turned out to be the perfect tools for the surveillance state .
It turned out that the capability to collect data , information and connections about basically any of us and all of us is exactly what we &apos;ve been hearing throughout of the summer through revelations and leaks about Western intelligence agencies , mostly U.S. intelligence agencies , watching over the rest of the world .
We &apos;ve heard about these starting with the revelations from June 6 .
Edward Snowden started leaking information , top secret classified information , from the U.S. intelligence agencies , and we started learning about things like PRISM and XKeyscore and others .
And these are examples of the kinds of programs U.S. intelligence agencies are running right now , against the whole rest of the world .
And if you look back about the forecasts on surveillance by George Orwell , well it turns out that George Orwell was an optimist .
( Laughter ) We are right now seeing a much larger scale of tracking of individual citizens than he could have ever imagined .
And this here is the infamous NSA data center in Utah .
Due to be opened very soon , it will be both a supercomputing center and a data storage center .
You could basically imagine it has a large hall filled with hard drives storing data they are collecting .
And it &apos;s a pretty big building .
How big ? Well , I can give you the numbers — 140,000 square meters — but that doesn &apos;t really tell you very much .
Maybe it &apos;s better to imagine it as a comparison .
You think about the largest IKEA store you &apos;ve ever been in .
This is five times larger .
How many hard drives can you fit in an IKEA store ?
Right ? It &apos;s pretty big .
We estimate that just the electricity bill for running this data center is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year .
And this kind of wholesale surveillance means that they can collect our data and keep it basically forever , keep it for extended periods of time , keep it for years , keep it for decades .
And this opens up completely new kinds of risks to us all .
And what this is is that it is wholesale blanket surveillance on everyone .
Well , not exactly everyone , because the U.S. intelligence only has a legal right to monitor foreigners .
They can monitor foreigners when foreigners &apos; data connections end up in the United States or pass through the United States .
And monitoring foreigners doesn &apos;t sound too bad until you realize that I &apos;m a foreigner and you &apos;re a foreigner .
In fact , 96 percent of the planet are foreigners .
( Laughter ) Right ?
So it is wholesale blanket surveillance of all of us , all of us who use telecommunications and the Internet .
But don &apos;t get me wrong : There are actually types of surveillance that are okay .
I love freedom , but even I agree that some surveillance is fine .
If the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer , or they &apos;re trying to catch a drug lord or trying to prevent a school shooting , and they have leads and they have suspects , then it &apos;s perfectly fine for them to tap the suspect &apos;s phone , and to intercept his Internet communications .
I &apos;m not arguing that at all , but that &apos;s not what programs like PRISM are about .
They are not about doing surveillance on people that they have reason to suspect of some wrongdoings .
They &apos;re about doing surveillance on people they know are innocent .
So the four main arguments supporting surveillance like this , well , the first of all is that whenever you start discussing about these revelations , there will be naysayers trying to minimize the importance of these revelations , saying that we knew all this already , we knew it was happening , there &apos;s nothing new here .
And that &apos;s not true . Don &apos;t let anybody tell you that we knew this already , because we did not know this already .
Our worst fears might have been something like this , but we didn &apos;t know this was happening .
Now we know for a fact it &apos;s happening .
We didn &apos;t know about this . We didn &apos;t know about PRISM .
We didn &apos;t know about XKeyscore . We didn &apos;t know about Cybertrans .
We didn &apos;t know about DoubleArrow .
We did not know about Skywriter — all these different programs run by U.S. intelligence agencies .
But now we do .
And we did not know that U.S. intelligence agencies go to extremes such as infiltrating standardization bodies to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose .
And what that means is that you take something which is secure , an encryption algorithm which is so secure that if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file , nobody can decrypt that file .
Even if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file , it &apos;s going to take millions of years .
So that &apos;s basically perfectly safe , uncrackable .
You take something which is that good and then you weaken it on purpose , making all of us less secure as an end result .
A real-world equivalent would be that intelligence agencies would force some secret pin code into every single house alarm so they could get into every single house because , you know , bad people might have house alarms , but it will also make all of us less secure as an end result .
Backdooring encryption algorithms just boggles the mind .
But of course , these intelligence agencies are doing their job .
This is what they have been told to do : do signals intelligence , monitor telecommunications , monitor Internet traffic .
That &apos;s what they &apos;re trying to do , and since most , a very big part of the Internet traffic today is encrypted , they &apos;re trying to find ways around the encryption .
One way is to sabotage encryption algorithms , which is a great example about how U.S. intelligence agencies are running loose .
They are completely out of control , and they should be brought back under control .
So what do we actually know about the leaks ?
Everything is based on the files leaked by Mr. Snowden .
The very first PRISM slides from the beginning of June detail a collection program where the data is collected from service providers , and they actually go and name the service providers they have access to .
They even have a specific date on when the collection of data began for each of the service providers .
So for example , they name the collection from Microsoft started on September 11 , 2007 , for Yahoo on the March 12 , 2008 , and then others : Google , Facebook , Skype , Apple and so on .
And every single one of these companies denies .
They all say that this simply isn &apos;t true , that they are not giving backdoor access to their data .
Yet we have these files .
So is one of the parties lying , or is there some other alternative explanation ?
And one explanation would be that these parties , these service providers , are not cooperating .
Instead , they &apos;ve been hacked .
That would explain it . They aren &apos;t cooperating . They &apos;ve been hacked .
In this case , they &apos;ve been hacked by their own government .
That might sound outlandish , but we already have cases where this has happened , for example , the case of the Flame malware which we strongly believe was authored by the U.S. government , and which , to spread , subverted the security of the Windows Update network , meaning here , the company was hacked by their own government .
And there &apos;s more evidence supporting this theory as well .
Der Spiegel , from Germany , leaked more information about the operations run by the elite hacker units operating inside these intelligence agencies .
Inside NSA , the unit is called TAO , Tailored Access Operations , and inside GCHQ , which is the U.K. equivalent , it &apos;s called NAC , Network Analysis Centre .
And these recent leaks of these three slides detail an operation run by this GCHQ intelligence agency from the United Kingdom targeting a telecom here in Belgium .
And what this really means is that an E.U. country &apos;s intelligence agency is breaching the security of a telecom of a fellow E.U. country on purpose , and they discuss it in their slides completely casually , business as usual .
Here &apos;s the primary target , here &apos;s the secondary target , here &apos;s the teaming .
They probably have a team building on Thursday evening in a pub .
They even use cheesy PowerPoint clip art like , you know , &quot; &quot; Success , &quot; &quot; when they gain access to services like this .
What the hell ?
And then there &apos;s the argument that okay , yes , this might be going on , but then again , other countries are doing it as well .
All countries spy .
And maybe that &apos;s true .
Many countries spy , not all of them , but let &apos;s take an example .
Let &apos;s take , for example , Sweden .
I &apos;m speaking of Sweden because Sweden has a little bit of a similar law to the United States .
When your data traffic goes through Sweden , their intelligence agency has a legal right by the law to intercept that traffic .
All right , how many Swedish decisionmakers and politicians and business leaders use , every day , U.S.-based services , like , you know , run Windows or OSX , or use Facebook or LinkedIn , or store their data in clouds like iCloud or Skydrive or DropBox , or maybe use online services like Amazon web services or sales support ?
And the answer is , every single Swedish business leader does that every single day .
And then we turn it around .
How many American leaders use Swedish webmails and cloud services ?
And the answer is zero .
So this is not balanced .
It &apos;s not balanced by any means , not even close .
And when we do have the occasional European success story , even those , then , typically end up being sold to the United States .
Like , Skype used to be secure .
It used to be end-to-end encrypted .
Then it was sold to the United States .
Today , it no longer is secure .
So once again , we take something which is secure and then we make it less secure on purpose , making all of us less secure as an outcome .
And then the argument that the United States is only fighting terrorists .
It &apos;s the war on terror .
You shouldn &apos;t worry about it .
Well , it &apos;s not the war on terror .
Yes , part of it is war on terror , and yes , there are terrorists , and they do kill and maim , and we should fight them , but we know through these leaks that they have used the same techniques to listen to phone calls of European leaders , to tap the email of residents of Mexico and Brazil , to read email traffic inside the United Nations Headquarters and E.U. Parliament , and I don &apos;t think they are trying to find terrorists from inside the E.U. Parliament , right ?
It &apos;s not the war on terror .
Part of it might be , and there are terrorists , but are we really thinking about terrorists as such an existential threat that we are willing to do anything at all to fight them ?
Are the Americans ready to throw away the Constituion and throw it in the trash just because there are terrorists ?
And the same thing with the Bill of Rights and all the amendments and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the E.U. conventions on human rights and fundamental freedoms and the press freedom ?
Do we really think terrorism is such an existential threat , we are ready to do anything at all ?
But people are scared about terrorists , and then they think that maybe that surveillance is okay because they have nothing to hide .
Feel free to survey me if that helps .
And whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide simply hasn &apos;t thought about this long enough .
( Applause ) Because we have this thing called privacy , and if you really think that you have nothing to hide , please make sure that &apos;s the first thing you tell me , because then I know that I should not trust you with any secrets , because obviously you can &apos;t keep a secret .
But people are brutally honest with the Internet , and when these leaks started , many people were asking me about this .
And I have nothing to hide .
I &apos;m not doing anything bad or anything illegal .
Yet , I have nothing that I would in particular like to share with an intelligence agency , especially a foreign intelligence agency .
And if we indeed need a Big Brother , I would much rather have a domestic Big Brother than a foreign Big Brother .
And when the leaks started , the very first thing I tweeted about this was a comment about how , when you &apos;ve been using search engines , you &apos;ve been potentially leaking all that to U.S. intelligence .
And two minutes later , I got a reply by somebody called Kimberly from the United States challenging me , like , why am I worried about this ?
What am I sending to worry about this ? Am I sending naked pictures or something ?
And my answer to Kimberly was that what I &apos;m sending is none of your business , and it should be none of your government &apos;s business either .
Because that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . It &apos;s about privacy .
Privacy is nonnegotiable .
It should be built in to all the systems we use .
( Applause ) And one thing we should all understand is that we are brutally honest with search engines .
You show me your search history , and I &apos;ll find something incriminating or something embarrassing there in five minutes .
We are more honest with search engines than we are with our families .
Search engines know more about you than your family members know about you .
And this is all the kind of information we are giving away , we are giving away to the United States .
And surveillance changes history .
We know this through examples of corrupt presidents like Nixon .
Imagine if he would have had the kind of surveillance tools that are available today .
And let me actually quote the president of Brazil , Ms. Dilma Rousseff .
She was one of the targets of NSA surveillance .
Her email was read , and she spoke at the United Nations Headquarters , and she said , &quot; &quot; If there is no right to privacy , there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion , and therefore , there can be no effective democracy . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
Privacy is the building block of our democracies .
And to quote a fellow security researcher , Marcus Ranum , he said that the United States is right now treating the Internet as it would be treating one of its colonies .
So we are back to the age of colonization , and we , the foreign users of the Internet , we should think about Americans as our masters .
So Mr. Snowden , he &apos;s been blamed for many things .
Some are blaming him for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry and software companies with these revelations — and blaming Snowden for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry would be the equivalent of blaming Al Gore for causing global warming .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So , what is there to be done ?
Should we worry . No , we shouldn &apos;t worry .
We should be angry , because this is wrong , and it &apos;s rude , and it should not be done .
But that &apos;s not going to really change the situation .
What &apos;s going to change the situation for the rest of the world is to try to steer away from systems built in the United States .
And that &apos;s much easier said than done .
How do you do that ?
A single country , any single country in Europe cannot replace and build replacements for the U.S.-made operating systems and cloud services .
But maybe you don &apos;t have to do it alone .
Maybe you can do it together with other countries .
The solution is open source .
By building together open , free , secure systems , we can go around such surveillance , and then one country doesn &apos;t have to solve the problem by itself .
It only has to solve one little problem .
And to quote a fellow security researcher , Haroon Meer , one country only has to make a small wave , but those small waves together become a tide , and the tide will lift all the boats up at the same time , and the tide we will build with secure , free , open-source systems , will become the tide that will lift all of us up and above the surveillance state .
Thank you very much .

A few years ago , I got one of those spam emails .
And it managed to get through my spam filter .
I &apos;m not quite sure how , but it turned up in my inbox , and it was from a guy called Solomon Odonkoh .
( Laughter ) I know . ( Laughter )
It went like this : it said , &quot; &quot; Hello James Veitch , I have an interesting business proposal I want to share with you , Solomon . &quot; &quot; Now , my hand was kind of hovering on the delete button , right ?
I was looking at my phone . I thought , I could just delete this .
Or I could do what I think we &apos;ve all always wanted to do .
( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; Solomon , Your email intrigues me . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And the game was afoot .
He said , &quot; &quot; Dear James Veitch , We shall be shipping Gold to you . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You will earn 10 % of any gold you distributes . &quot; ( Laughter )
So I knew I was dealing with a professional . ( Laughter )
I said , &quot; &quot; How much is it worth ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; We will start with smaller quantity , &quot; &quot; — I was like , aww — and then he said , &quot; &quot; of 25 kgs . ( Laughter )
The worth should be about $ 2.5 million . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Solomon , if we &apos;re going to do it , let &apos;s go big .
( Applause ) I can handle it . How much gold do you have ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; It is not a matter of how much gold I have , what matters is your capability of handling .
We can start with 50 kgs as trial shipment . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; 50 kgs ?
Then I started to panic .
I was like , &quot; &quot; Where are you based ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know about you , but I think if we &apos;re going via the postal service , it ought to be signed for .
That &apos;s a lot of gold . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It will not be easy to convince my company to do larger quantity shipment . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Solomon , I &apos;m completely with you on this one .
I &apos;m putting together a visual for you to take into the board meeting .
Hold tight . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is what I sent Solomon . ( Laughter )
( Applause ) I don &apos;t know if we have any statisticians in the house , but there &apos;s definitely something going on . ( Laughter )
I said , &quot; &quot; Solomon , attached to this email you &apos;ll find a helpful chart .
I &apos;ve had one of my assistants run the numbers .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re ready for shipping as much gold as possible . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s always a moment where they try to tug your heartstrings , and this was it for Solomon .
And I said , &quot; &quot; One word ; Hummus . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; It &apos;s going places . ( Laughter )
I was in Sainsbury &apos;s the other day and there were like 30 different varieties .
Also you can cut up carrots , and you can dip them .
( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; Solomon , I spent all night coming up with this code we need to use in all further correspondence : Lawyer : Gummy Bear .
Bank : Cream Egg .
Legal : Fizzy Cola Bottle . Claim : Peanut M &amp; Ms.
Documents : Jelly Beans .
Western Union : A Giant Gummy Lizard . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I knew these were all words they use , right ?
I said , &quot; &quot; Please call me Kitkat in all further correspondence . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t hear back . I thought , I &apos;ve gone too far .
I &apos;ve gone too far . So I had to backpedal a little .
I said , &quot; &quot; Solomon , Is the deal still on ?
KitKat . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because you have to be consistent .
Then I did get an email back from him .
He said , &quot; &quot; The Business is on and I am trying to blah blah blah ... &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Dude , you have to use the code ! &quot; &quot; What followed is the greatest email I &apos;ve ever received .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m not joking , this is what turned up in my inbox .
This was a good day .
&quot; &quot; The business is on .
I am trying to raise the balance for the Gummy Bear — ( Laughter ) so he can submit all the needed Fizzy Cola Bottle Jelly Beans to the Creme Egg , for the Peanut M &amp; Ms process to start . ( Laughter )
Send 1,500 pounds via a Giant Gummy Lizard . &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) And that was so much fun , right , that it got me thinking : like , what would happen if I just spent as much time as could replying to as many scam emails as I could ?
And that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been doing for three years on your behalf .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Crazy stuff happens when you start replying to scam emails .
It &apos;s really difficult , and I highly recommend we do it .
I don &apos;t think what I &apos;m doing is mean .
There are a lot of people who do mean things to scammers .
All I &apos;m doing is wasting their time .
And if you &apos;re going to do this — and I highly recommend you do — get yourself a pseudonymous email address .
Don &apos;t use your own email address .
That &apos;s what I was doing at the start and it was a nightmare .
I know so many .
&quot; &quot; I NEED TO TRANSFER 45 MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF MY HUSBAND NELSON MANDELA &apos;S HEALTH CONDITION . &quot; &quot; Let that sink in .
She sent me this , which is hysterical .
( Laughter ) And this .
And this looks fairly legitimate , this is a letter of authorization .
But to be honest , if there &apos;s nothing written on it , it &apos;s just a shape !
( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; Winnie , I &apos;m really sorry to hear of this .
Given that Nelson died three months ago , I &apos;d describe his health condition as fairly serious . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) That &apos;s the worst health condition you can have , not being alive .
She said , &quot; &quot; KINDLY COMPLY WITH MY BANKERS INSTRUCTIONS .
I SHOT THE SHERIFF . &quot; &quot; &#91; ( BUT I DID NOT SHOOT THE DEPUTY ) &#93; ( Laughter ) Thank you .
( Applause )
When I was about three or four years old , I remember my mum reading a story to me and my two big brothers , and I remember putting up my hands to feel the page of the book , to feel the picture they were discussing .
And my mum said , &quot; &quot; Darling , remember that you can &apos;t see and you can &apos;t feel the picture and you can &apos;t feel the print on the page . &quot; &quot; And I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; But that &apos;s what I want to do .
I love stories . I want to read . &quot; &quot; Little did I know that I would be part of a technological revolution that would make that dream come true .
I was born premature by about 10 weeks , which resulted in my blindness , some 64 years ago .
The condition is known as retrolental fibroplasia , and it &apos;s now very rare in the developed world .
Little did I know , lying curled up in my prim baby humidicrib in 1948 that I &apos;d been born at the right place and the right time , that I was in a country where I could participate in the technological revolution .
There are 37 million totally blind people on our planet , but those of us who &apos;ve shared in the technological changes mainly come from North America , Europe , Japan and other developed parts of the world .
Computers have changed the lives of us all in this room and around the world , but I think they &apos;ve changed the lives of we blind people more than any other group .
And so I want to tell you about the interaction between computer-based adaptive technology and the many volunteers who helped me over the years to become the person I am today .
It &apos;s an interaction between volunteers , passionate inventors and technology , and it &apos;s a story that many other blind people could tell .
But let me tell you a bit about it today .
When I was five , I went to school and I learned braille .
It &apos;s an ingenious system of six dots that are punched into paper , and I can feel them with my fingers .
In fact , I think they &apos;re putting up my grade six report .
I don &apos;t know where Julian Morrow got that from .
( Laughter ) I was pretty good in reading , but religion and musical appreciation needed more work . ( Laughter )
When you leave the opera house , you &apos;ll find there &apos;s braille signage in the lifts .
Look for it . Have you noticed it ?
I do . I look for it all the time .
( Laughter ) When I was at school , the books were transcribed by transcribers , voluntary people who punched one dot at a time so I &apos;d have volumes to read , and that had been going on , mainly by women , since the late 19th century in this country , but it was the only way I could read .
When I was in high school , I got my first Philips reel-to-reel tape recorder , and tape recorders became my sort of pre-computer medium of learning .
I could have family and friends read me material , and I could then read it back as many times as I needed .
And it brought me into contact with volunteers and helpers .
For example , when I studied at graduate school at Queen &apos;s University in Canada , the prisoners at the Collins Bay jail agreed to help me .
I gave them a tape recorder , and they read into it .
As one of them said to me , &quot; Ron , we ain &apos;t going anywhere at the moment . &quot;
( Laughter ) But think of it . These men , who hadn &apos;t had the educational opportunities I &apos;d had , helped me gain post-graduate qualifications in law by their dedicated help .
Well , I went back and became an academic at Melbourne &apos;s Monash University , and for those 25 years , tape recorders were everything to me .
In fact , in my office in 1990 , I had 18 miles of tape .
Students , family and friends all read me material .
Mrs. Lois Doery , whom I later came to call my surrogate mum , read me many thousands of hours onto tape .
One of the reasons I agreed to give this talk today was that I was hoping that Lois would be here so I could introduce you to her and publicly thank her .
But sadly , her health hasn &apos;t permitted her to come today .
But I thank you here , Lois , from this platform .
( Applause ) I saw my first Apple computer in 1984 , and I thought to myself , &quot; This thing &apos;s got a glass screen , not much use to me . &quot;
How very wrong I was .
In 1987 , in the month our eldest son Gerard was born , I got my first blind computer , and it &apos;s actually here .
See it up there ?
And you see it has no , what do you call it , no screen .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a blind computer . ( Laughter )
It &apos;s a Keynote Gold 84k , and the 84k stands for it had 84 kilobytes of memory . ( Laughter )
Don &apos;t laugh , it cost me 4,000 dollars at the time . ( Laughter ) I think there &apos;s more memory in my watch .
It was invented by Russell Smith , a passionate inventor in New Zealand who was trying to help blind people .
Sadly , he died in a light plane crash in 2005 , but his memory lives on in my heart .
It meant , for the first time , I could read back what I had typed into it .
It had a speech synthesizer .
I &apos;d written my first coauthored labor law book on a typewriter in 1979 purely from memory .
This now allowed me to read back what I &apos;d written and to enter the computer world , even with its 84k of memory .
In 1974 , the great Ray Kurzweil , the American inventor , worked on building a machine that would scan books and read them out in synthetic speech .
Optical character recognition units then only operated usually on one font , but by using charge-coupled device flatbed scanners and speech synthesizers , he developed a machine that could read any font .
And his machine , which was as big as a washing machine , was launched on the 13th of January , 1976 .
I saw my first commercially available Kurzweil in March 1989 , and it blew me away , and in September 1989 , the month that my associate professorship at Monash University was announced , the law school got one , and I could use it .
For the first time , I could read what I wanted to read by putting a book on the scanner .
I didn &apos;t have to be nice to people !
( Laughter ) I no longer would be censored .
For example , I was too shy then , and I &apos;m actually too shy now , to ask anybody to read me out loud sexually explicit material .
( Laughter ) But , you know , I could pop a book on in the middle of the night , and — ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Now , the Kurzweil reader is simply a program on my laptop .
That &apos;s what it &apos;s shrunk to .
And now I can scan the latest novel and not wait to get it into talking book libraries .
I can keep up with my friends .
There are many people who have helped me in my life , and many that I haven &apos;t met .
One is another American inventor Ted Henter .
Ted was a motorcycle racer , but in 1978 he had a car accident and lost his sight , which is devastating if you &apos;re trying to ride motorbikes .
He then turned to being a waterskier and was a champion disabled waterskier .
But in 1989 , he teamed up with Bill Joyce to develop a program that would read out what was on the computer screen from the Net or from what was on the computer .
It &apos;s called JAWS , Job Access With Speech , and it sounds like this .
( JAWS speaking ) Ron McCallum : Isn &apos;t that slow ?
( Laughter ) You see , if I read like that , I &apos;d fall asleep .
I slowed it down for you .
I &apos;m going to ask that we play it at the speed I read it .
Can we play that one ?
( JAWS speaking ) ( Laughter ) RM : You know , when you &apos;re marking student essays , you want to get through them fairly quickly .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This technology that fascinated me in 1987 is now on my iPhone and on yours as well .
But , you know , I find reading with machines a very lonely process .
I grew up with family , friends , reading to me , and I loved the warmth and the breath and the closeness of people reading .
Do you love being read to ?
And one of my most enduring memories is in 1999 , Mary reading to me and the children down near Manly Beach &quot; Harry Potter and the Philosopher &apos;s Stone . &quot;
Isn &apos;t that a great book ?
I still love being close to someone reading to me .
But I wouldn &apos;t give up the technology , because it &apos;s allowed me to lead a great life .
Of course , talking books for the blind predated all this technology .
After all , the long-playing record was developed in the early 1930s , and now we put talking books on CDs using the digital access system known as DAISY .
But when I &apos;m reading with synthetic voices , I love to come home and read a racy novel with a real voice .
Now there are still barriers in front of we people with disabilities .
Many websites we can &apos;t read using JAWS and the other technologies .
Websites are often very visual , and there are all these sorts of graphs that aren &apos;t labeled and buttons that aren &apos;t labeled , and that &apos;s why the World Wide Web Consortium 3 , known as W3C , has developed worldwide standards for the Internet .
And we want all Internet users or Internet site owners to make their sites compatible so that we persons without vision can have a level playing field .
There are other barriers brought about by our laws .
For example , Australia , like about one third of the world &apos;s countries , has copyright exceptions which allow books to be brailled or read for we blind persons .
But those books can &apos;t travel across borders .
For example , in Spain , there are a 100,000 accessible books in Spanish .
In Argentina , there are 50,000 .
In no other Latin American country are there more than a couple of thousand .
But it &apos;s not legal to transport the books from Spain to Latin America .
There are hundreds of thousands of accessible books in the United States , Britain , Canada , Australia , etc . , but they can &apos;t be transported to the 60 countries in our world where English is the first and the second language .
And remember I was telling you about Harry Potter .
Well , because we can &apos;t transport books across borders , there had to be separate versions read in all the different English-speaking countries : Britain , United States , Canada , Australia , and New Zealand all had to have separate readings of Harry Potter .
And that &apos;s why , next month in Morocco , a meeting is taking place between all the countries .
It &apos;s something that a group of countries and the World Blind Union are advocating , a cross-border treaty so that if books are available under a copyright exception and the other country has a copyright exception , we can transport those books across borders and give life to people , particularly in developing countries , blind people who don &apos;t have the books to read .
I want that to happen .
( Applause ) My life has been extraordinarily blessed with marriage and children and certainly interesting work to do , whether it be at the University of Sydney Law School , where I served a term as dean , or now as I sit on the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities , in Geneva .
I &apos;ve indeed been a very fortunate human being .
I wonder what the future will hold .
The technology will advance even further , but I can still remember my mum saying , 60 years ago , &quot; &quot; Remember , darling , you &apos;ll never be able to read the print with your fingers . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so glad that the interaction between braille transcribers , volunteer readers and passionate inventors , has allowed this dream of reading to come true for me and for blind people throughout the world .
I &apos;d like to thank my researcher Hannah Martin , who is my slide clicker , who clicks the slides , and my wife , Professor Mary Crock , who &apos;s the light of my life , is coming on to collect me .
I want to thank her too .
I think I have to say goodbye now .
Bless you . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Yay ! ( Applause ) Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay . ( Applause )
I run a design studio in New York .
Every seven years , I close it for one year to pursue some little experiments , things that are always difficult to accomplish during the regular working year .
In that year , we are not available for any of our clients .
We are totally closed .
And as you can imagine , it is a lovely and very energetic time .
I originally had opened the studio in New York to combine my two loves , music and design .
And we created videos and packaging for many musicians that you know , and for even more that you &apos;ve never heard of .
As I realized , just like with many many things in my life that I actually love , I adapt to it .
And I get , over time , bored by them .
And for sure , in our case , our work started to look the same .
You see here a glass eye in a die cut of a book .
Quite the similar idea , then , a perfume packaged in a book , in a die cut .
So I decided to close it down for one year .
Also is the knowledge that right now we spend about in the first 25 years of our lives learning , then there is another 40 years that &apos;s really reserved for working .
And then tacked on at the end of it are about 15 years for retirement .
And I thought it might be helpful to basically cut off five of those retirement years and intersperse them in between those working years .
( Applause ) That &apos;s clearly enjoyable for myself .
But probably even more important is that the work that comes out of these years flows back into the company and into society at large , rather than just benefiting a grandchild or two .
There is a fellow TEDster who spoke two years ago , Jonathan Haidt , who defined his work into three different levels .
And they rang very true for me .
I can see my work as a job . I do it for money .
I likely already look forward to the weekend on Thursdays .
And I probably will need a hobby as a leveling mechanism .
In a career I &apos;m definitely more engaged .
But at the same time , there will be periods when I think is all that really hard work really worth my while ?
While in the third one , in the calling , very much likely I would do it also if I wouldn &apos;t be financially compensated for it .
I am not a religious person myself , but I did look for nature .
I had spent my first sabbatical in New York City .
Looked for something different for the second one .
Europe and the U.S. didn &apos;t really feel enticing because I knew them too well . So Asia it was .
The most beautiful landscapes I had seen in Asia were Sri Lanka and Bali .
Sri Lanka still had the civil war going on , so Bali it was .
It &apos;s a wonderful , very craft-oriented society .
I arrived there in September 2008 , and pretty much started to work right away .
There is wonderful inspiration coming from the area itself .
However the first thing that I needed was mosquito repellent typography because they were definitely around heavily .
And then I needed some sort of way to be able to get back to all the wild dogs that surround my house , and attacked me during my morning walks .
So we created this series of 99 portraits on tee shirts .
Every single dog on one tee shirt .
As a little retaliation with a just ever so slightly menacing message ( Laughter ) on the back of the shirt . ( Laughter )
Just before I left New York I decided I could actually renovate my studio .
And then just leave it all to them .
And I don &apos;t have to do anything .
So I looked for furniture .
And it turned out that all the furniture that I really liked , I couldn &apos;t afford .
And all the stuff I could afford , I didn &apos;t like .
So one of the things that we pursued in Bali was pieces of furniture .
This one , of course , still works with the wild dogs .
It &apos;s not quite finished yet .
And I think by the time this lamp came about , ( Laughter ) I had finally made peace with those dogs . ( Laughter )
Then there is a coffee table . I also did a coffee table .
It &apos;s called Be Here Now .
It includes 330 compasses .
And we had custom espresso cups made that hide a magnet inside , and make those compasses go crazy , always centering on them .
Then this is a fairly talkative , verbose kind of chair .
I also started meditating for the first time in my life in Bali .
And at the same time , I &apos;m extremely aware how boring it is to hear about other people &apos;s happinesses .
So I will not really go too far into it .
Many of you will know this TEDster , Danny Gilbert , whose book , actually , I got it through the TED book club .
I think it took me four years to finally read it , while on sabbatical .
And I was pleased to see that he actually wrote the book while he was on sabbatical .
And I &apos;ll show you a couple of people that did well by pursuing sabbaticals .
This is Ferran Adria . Many people think he is right now the best chef in the world with his restaurant north of Barcelona , El Bulli .
His restaurant is open seven months every year .
He closes it down for five months to experiment with a full kitchen staff .
His latest numbers are fairly impressive .
He can seat , throughout the year , he can seat 8,000 people .
And he has 2.2 million requests for reservations .
If I look at my cycle , seven years , one year sabbatical , it &apos;s 12.5 percent of my time .
And if I look at companies that are actually more successful than mine , 3M since the 1930s is giving all their engineers 15 percent to pursue whatever they want .
There is some good successes .
Scotch tape came out of this program , as well as Art Fry developed sticky notes from during his personal time for 3M .
Google , of course , very famously gives 20 percent for their software engineers to pursue their own personal projects .
Anybody in here has actually ever conducted a sabbatical ?
That &apos;s about five percent of everybody .
So I &apos;m not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up .
Talk to them about if it was successful or not .
I &apos;ve found that finding out about what I &apos;m going to like in the future , my very best way is to talk to people who have actually done it much better than myself envisioning it .
When I had the idea of doing one , the process was I made the decision and I put it into my daily planner book .
And then I told as many , many people as I possibly could about it so that there was no way that I could chicken out later on .
( Laughter ) In the beginning , on the first sabbatical , it was rather disastrous .
I had thought that I should do this without any plan , that this vacuum of time somehow would be wonderful and enticing for idea generation . It was not .
I just , without a plan , I just reacted to little requests , not work requests , those I all said no to , but other little requests .
Sending mail to Japanese design magazines and things like that .
So I became my own intern .
( Laughter ) And I very quickly made a list of the things I was interested in , put them in a hierarchy , divided them into chunks of time and then made a plan , very much like in grade school .
What does it say here ? Monday , 8 to 9 : story writing ; 9 to 10 : future thinking .
Was not very successful . And so on and so forth .
And that actually , specifically as a starting point of the first sabbatical , worked really well for me .
What came out of it ?
I really got close to design again .
I had fun .
Financially , seen over the long term , it was actually successful .
Because of the improved quality , we could ask for higher prices .
And probably most importantly , basically everything we &apos;ve done in the seven years following the first sabbatical came out of thinking of that one single year .
And I &apos;ll show you a couple of projects that came out of the seven years following that sabbatical .
One of the strands of thinking I was involved in was that sameness is so incredibly overrated .
This whole idea that everything needs to be exactly the same works for a very very few strand of companies , and not for everybody else .
We were asked to design an identity for Casa da Musica , the Rem Koolhaas-built music center in Porto , in Portugal .
And even though I desired to do an identity that doesn &apos;t use the architecture , I failed at that .
And mostly also because I realized out of a Rem Koolhaas presentation to the city of Porto , where he talked about a conglomeration of various layers of meaning .
Which I understood after I translated it from architecture speech in to regular English , basically as logo making .
And I understood that the building itself was a logo .
So then it became quite easy .
We put a mask on it , looked at it deep down in the ground , checked it out from all sides , west , north , south , east , top and bottom .
Colored them in a very particular way by having a friend of mine write a piece of software , the Casa da Musica Logo Generator .
That &apos;s connected to a scanner .
You put any image in there , like that Beethoven image .
And the software , in a second , will give you the Casa da Musica Beethoven logo .
Which , when you actually have to design a Beethoven poster , comes in handy , because the visual information of the logo and the actual poster is exactly the same .
So it will always fit together , conceptually , of course .
If Zappa &apos;s music is performed , it gets its own logo .
Or Philip Glass or Lou Reed or the Chemical Brothers , who all performed there , get their own Casa da Musica logo .
It works the same internally with the president or the musical director , whose Casa da Musica portraits wind up on their business cards .
There is a full-blown orchestra living inside the building .
It has a more transparent identity .
The truck they go on tour with .
Or there &apos;s a smaller contemporary orchestra , 12 people that remixes its own title .
And one of the handy things that came about was that you could take the logo type and create advertising out of it .
Like this Donna Toney poster , or Chopin , or Mozart , or La Monte Young .
You can take the shape and make typography out of it .
You can grow it underneath the skin .
You can have a poster for a family event in front of the house , or a rave underneath the house or a weekly program , as well as educational services .
Second insight . So far , until that point I had been mostly involved or used the language of design for promotional purposes , which was fine with me .
On one hand I have nothing against selling .
My parents are both salespeople .
But I did feel that I spent so much time learning this language , why do I only promote with it ?
There must be something else .
And the whole series of work came out of it .
Some of you might have seen it .
I showed some of it at earlier TEDs before , under the title &quot; &quot; Things I &apos;ve Learned in My Life So Far . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll just show two now .
This is a whole wall of bananas at different ripenesses on the opening day in this gallery in New York .
It says , &quot; &quot; Self-confidence produces fine results . &quot; &quot; This is after a week .
After two weeks , three weeks , four weeks , five weeks .
And you see the self confidence almost comes back , but not quite .
These are some pictures visitors sent to me .
( Laughter ) And then the city of Amsterdam gave us a plaza and asked us to do something .
We used the stone plates as a grid for our little piece .
We got 250,000 coins from the central bank , at different darknesses .
So we got brand new ones , shiny ones , medium ones , and very old , dark ones .
And with the help of 100 volunteers , over a week , created this fairly floral typography that spelled , &quot; &quot; Obsessions make my life worse and my work better . &quot; &quot; And the idea of course was to make the type so precious that as an audience you would be in between , &quot; &quot; Should I really take as much money as I can ?
Or should I leave the piece intact as it is right now ? &quot; &quot; While we built all this up during that week , with the 100 volunteers , a good number of the neighbors surrounding the plaza got very close to it and quite loved it .
So when it was finally done , and in the first night a guy came with big plastic bags and scooped up as many coins as he could possibly carry , one of the neighbors called the police .
And the Amsterdam police in all their wisdom , came , saw , and they wanted to protect the artwork .
And they swept it all up and put it into custody at police headquarters .
( Laughter ) I think you see , you see them sweeping . You see them sweeping right here .
That &apos;s the police , getting rid of it all .
So after eight hours that &apos;s pretty much all that was left of the whole thing .
( Laughter ) We are also working on the start of a bigger project in Bali .
It &apos;s a movie about happiness .
And here we asked some nearby pigs to do the titles for us .
They weren &apos;t quite slick enough .
So we asked the goose to do it again , and hoped she would do somehow , a more elegant or pretty job .
And I think she overdid it .
Just a bit too ornamental .
And my studio is very close to the monkey forest .
And the monkeys in that monkey forest looked , actually , fairly happy .
So we asked those guys to do it again .
They did a fine job , but had a couple of readability problems .
So of course whatever you don &apos;t really do yourself doesn &apos;t really get done properly .
That film we &apos;ll be working on for the next two years .
So it &apos;s going to be a while .
And of course you might think that doing a film on happiness might not really be worthwhile .
Then you can of course always go and see this guy .
Video : ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m happy I &apos;m alive .
I &apos;m happy I &apos;m alive . I &apos;m happy I &apos;m alive .
Stefan Sagmeister : Thank you .
( Applause )
Hi . So , this chap here , he thinks he can tell you the future .
His name is Nostradamus , although here the Sun have made him look a little bit like Sean Connery . ( Laughter ) And like most of you , I suspect , I don &apos;t really believe that people can see into the future .
I don &apos;t believe in precognition , and every now and then , you hear that somebody has been able to predict something that happened in the future , and that &apos;s probably because it was a fluke , and we only hear about the flukes and about the freaks .
We don &apos;t hear about all the times that people got stuff wrong .
Now we expect that to happen with silly stories about precognition , but the problem is , we have exactly the same problem in academia and in medicine , and in this environment , it costs lives .
So firstly , thinking just about precognition , as it turns out , just last year a researcher called Daryl Bem conducted a piece of research where he found evidence of precognitive powers in undergraduate students , and this was published in a peer-reviewed academic journal and most of the people who read this just said , &quot; &quot; Okay , well , fair enough , but I think that &apos;s a fluke , that &apos;s a freak , because I know that if I did a study where I found no evidence that undergraduate students had precognitive powers , it probably wouldn &apos;t get published in a journal .
And in fact , we know that that &apos;s true , because several different groups of research scientists tried to replicate the findings of this precognition study , and when they submitted it to the exact same journal , the journal said , &quot; &quot; No , we &apos;re not interested in publishing replication . We &apos;re not interested in your negative data . &quot; &quot; So this is already evidence of how , in the academic literature , we will see a biased sample of the true picture of all of the scientific studies that have been conducted .
But it doesn &apos;t just happen in the dry academic field of psychology .
It also happens in , for example , cancer research .
So in March , 2012 , just one month ago , some researchers reported in the journal Nature how they had tried to replicate 53 different basic science studies looking at potential treatment targets in cancer , and out of those 53 studies , they were only able to successfully replicate six .
Forty-seven out of those 53 were unreplicable .
And they say in their discussion that this is very likely because freaks get published .
People will do lots and lots and lots of different studies , and the occasions when it works they will publish , and the ones where it doesn &apos;t work they won &apos;t .
And their first recommendation of how to fix this problem , because it is a problem , because it sends us all down blind alleys , their first recommendation of how to fix this problem is to make it easier to publish negative results in science , and to change the incentives so that scientists are encouraged to post more of their negative results in public .
But it doesn &apos;t just happen in the very dry world of preclinical basic science cancer research .
It also happens in the very real , flesh and blood of academic medicine . So in 1980 , some researchers did a study on a drug called lorcainide , and this was an anti-arrhythmic drug , a drug that suppresses abnormal heart rhythms , and the idea was , after people have had a heart attack , they &apos;re quite likely to have abnormal heart rhythms , so if we give them a drug that suppresses abnormal heart rhythms , this will increase the chances of them surviving .
Early on its development , they did a very small trial , just under a hundred patients .
Fifty patients got lorcainide , and of those patients , 10 died .
Another 50 patients got a dummy placebo sugar pill with no active ingredient , and only one of them died .
So they rightly regarded this drug as a failure , and its commercial development was stopped , and because its commercial development was stopped , this trial was never published .
Unfortunately , over the course of the next five , 10 years , other companies had the same idea about drugs that would prevent arrhythmias in people who have had heart attacks .
These drugs were brought to market . They were prescribed very widely because heart attacks are a very common thing , and it took so long for us to find out that these drugs also caused an increased rate of death that before we detected that safety signal , over 100,000 people died unnecessarily in America from the prescription of anti-arrhythmic drugs .
Now actually , in 1993 , the researchers who did that 1980 study , that early study , published a mea culpa , an apology to the scientific community , in which they said , &quot; &quot; When we carried out our study in 1980 , we thought that the increased death rate that occurred in the lorcainide group was an effect of chance . &quot; &quot; The development of lorcainide was abandoned for commercial reasons , and this study was never published ; it &apos;s now a good example of publication bias .
That &apos;s the technical term for the phenomenon where unflattering data gets lost , gets unpublished , is left missing in action , and they say the results described here &quot; might have provided an early warning of trouble ahead . &quot;
Now these are stories from basic science .
These are stories from 20 , 30 years ago .
The academic publishing environment is very different now .
There are academic journals like &quot; &quot; Trials , &quot; &quot; the open access journal , which will publish any trial conducted in humans regardless of whether it has a positive or a negative result .
But this problem of negative results that go missing in action is still very prevalent . In fact it &apos;s so prevalent that it cuts to the core of evidence-based medicine .
So this is a drug called reboxetine , and this is a drug that I myself have prescribed . It &apos;s an antidepressant .
And I &apos;m a very nerdy doctor , so I read all of the studies that I could on this drug . I read the one study that was published that showed that reboxetine was better than placebo , and I read the other three studies that were published that showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other antidepressant , and because this patient hadn &apos;t done well on those other antidepressants , I thought , well , reboxetine is just as good . It &apos;s one to try .
But it turned out that I was misled . In fact , seven trials were conducted comparing reboxetine against a dummy placebo sugar pill . One of them was positive and that was published , but six of them were negative and they were left unpublished .
Three trials were published comparing reboxetine against other antidepressants in which reboxetine was just as good , and they were published , but three times as many patients &apos; worth of data was collected which showed that reboxetine was worse than those other treatments , and those trials were not published .
I felt misled .
Now you might say , well , that &apos;s an extremely unusual example , and I wouldn &apos;t want to be guilty of the same kind of cherry-picking and selective referencing that I &apos;m accusing other people of .
But it turns out that this phenomenon of publication bias has actually been very , very well studied .
So here is one example of how you approach it .
The classic model is , you get a bunch of studies where you know that they &apos;ve been conducted and completed , and then you go and see if they &apos;ve been published anywhere in the academic literature . So this took all of the trials that had ever been conducted on antidepressants that were approved over a 15-year period by the FDA .
They took all of the trials which were submitted to the FDA as part of the approval package .
So that &apos;s not all of the trials that were ever conducted on these drugs , because we can never know if we have those , but it is the ones that were conducted in order to get the marketing authorization .
And then they went to see if these trials had been published in the peer-reviewed academic literature . And this is what they found .
It was pretty much a 50-50 split . Half of these trials were positive , half of them were negative , in reality .
But when they went to look for these trials in the peer-reviewed academic literature , what they found was a very different picture .
Only three of the negative trials were published , but all but one of the positive trials were published .
Now if we just flick back and forth between those two , you can see what a staggering difference there was between reality and what doctors , patients , commissioners of health services , and academics were able to see in the peer-reviewed academic literature .
We were misled , and this is a systematic flaw in the core of medicine .
In fact , there have been so many studies conducted on publication bias now , over a hundred , that they &apos;ve been collected in a systematic review , published in 2010 , that took every single study on publication bias that they could find .
Publication bias affects every field of medicine .
About half of all trials , on average , go missing in action , and we know that positive findings are around twice as likely to be published as negative findings .
This is a cancer at the core of evidence-based medicine .
If I flipped a coin 100 times but then withheld the results from you from half of those tosses , I could make it look as if I had a coin that always came up heads .
But that wouldn &apos;t mean that I had a two-headed coin .
That would mean that I was a chancer and you were an idiot for letting me get away with it . ( Laughter ) But this is exactly what we blindly tolerate in the whole of evidence-based medicine .
And to me , this is research misconduct .
If I conducted one study and I withheld half of the data points from that one study , you would rightly accuse me , essentially , of research fraud .
And yet , for some reason , if somebody conducts 10 studies but only publishes the five that give the result that they want , we don &apos;t consider that to be research misconduct .
And when that responsibility is diffused between a whole network of researchers , academics , industry sponsors , journal editors , for some reason we find it more acceptable , but the effect on patients is damning .
And this is happening right now , today .
This is a drug called Tamiflu . Tamiflu is a drug which governments around the world have spent billions and billions of dollars on stockpiling , and we &apos;ve stockpiled Tamiflu in panic , in the belief that it will reduce the rate of complications of influenza .
Complications is a medical euphemism for pneumonia and death . ( Laughter ) Now when the Cochrane systematic reviewers were trying to collect together all of the data from all of the trials that had ever been conducted on whether Tamiflu actually did this or not , they found that several of those trials were unpublished .
The results were unavailable to them .
And when they started obtaining the writeups of those trials through various different means , through Freedom of Information Act requests , through harassing various different organizations , what they found was inconsistent .
And when they tried to get a hold of the clinical study reports , the 10,000-page long documents that have the best possible rendition of the information , they were told they weren &apos;t allowed to have them .
And if you want to read the full correspondence and the excuses and the explanations given by the drug company , you can see that written up in this week &apos;s edition of PLOS Medicine .
And the most staggering thing of all of this , to me , is that not only is this a problem , not only do we recognize that this is a problem , but we &apos;ve had to suffer fake fixes .
We &apos;ve had people pretend that this is a problem that &apos;s been fixed .
First of all , we had trials registers , and everybody said , oh , it &apos;s okay . We &apos;ll get everyone to register their trials , they &apos;ll post the protocol , they &apos;ll say what they &apos;re going to do before they do it , and then afterwards we &apos;ll be able to check and see if all the trials which have been conducted and completed have been published .
But people didn &apos;t bother to use those registers .
And so then the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors came along , and they said , oh , well , we will hold the line .
We won &apos;t publish any journals , we won &apos;t publish any trials , unless they &apos;ve been registered before they began .
But they didn &apos;t hold the line . In 2008 , a study was conducted which showed that half of all of trials published by journals edited by members of the ICMJE weren &apos;t properly registered , and a quarter of them weren &apos;t registered at all .
And then finally , the FDA Amendment Act was passed a couple of years ago saying that everybody who conducts a trial must post the results of that trial within one year .
And in the BMJ , in the first edition of January , 2012 , you can see a study which looks to see if people kept to that ruling , and it turns out that only one in five have done so .
This is a disaster .
We cannot know the true effects of the medicines that we prescribe if we do not have access to all of the information .
And this is not a difficult problem to fix .
We need to force people to publish all trials conducted in humans , including the older trials , because the FDA Amendment Act only asks that you publish the trials conducted after 2008 , and I don &apos;t know what world it is in which we &apos;re only practicing medicine on the basis of trials that completed in the past two years .
We need to publish all trials in humans , including the older trials , for all drugs in current use , and you need to tell everyone you know that this is a problem and that it has not been fixed .
Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
Photography has been my passion ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera , but today I want to share with you the 15 most treasured photos of mine , and I didn &apos;t take any of them .
There were no art directors , no stylists , no chance for reshoots , not even any regard for lighting .
In fact , most of them were taken by random tourists .
My story begins when I was in New York City for a speaking engagement , and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday . We &apos;re on the corner of 57th and 5th .
We happened to be back in New York exactly a year later , so we decided to take the same picture .
Well you can see where this is going .
Approaching my daughter &apos;s third birthday , my wife said , &quot; &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you take Sabina back to New York and make it a father-daughter trip , and continue the ritual ? &quot; &quot; This is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture .
You know , it &apos;s remarkable how universal the gesture is of handing your camera to a total stranger .
No one &apos;s ever refused , and luckily no one &apos;s ever run off with our camera .
Back then , we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives .
It &apos;s really become sacred to us .
This one was taken just weeks after 9 / 11 , and I found myself trying to explain what had happened that day in ways a five-year-old could understand .
So these photos are far more than proxies for a single moment , or even a specific trip .
They &apos;re also ways for us to freeze time for one week in October and reflect on our times and how we change from year to year , and not just physically , but in every way .
Because while we take the same photo , our perspectives change , and she reaches new milestones , and I get to see life through her eyes , and how she interacts with and sees everything .
This very focused time we get to spend together is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year .
Recently , on one trip , we were walking , and she stops dead in her tracks , and she points to a red awning of the doll store that she loved when she was little on our earlier trips .
And she describes to me the feeling she felt as a five-year-old standing in that exact spot .
She said she remembers her heart bursting out of her chest when she saw that place for the very first time nine years earlier .
And now what she &apos;s looking at in New York are colleges , because she &apos;s determined to go to school in New York .
And it hit me : One of the most important things we all make are memories .
So I want to share the idea of taking an active role in consciously creating memories .
I don &apos;t know about you , but aside from these 15 shots , I &apos;m not in many of the family photos .
I &apos;m always the one taking the picture .
So I want to encourage everyone today to get in the shot , and don &apos;t hesitate to go up to someone and ask , &quot; Will you take our picture ? &quot;
Thank you . ( Applause )
But the difference here is that you can use any surface , you can walk up to any surface , including your hand , if nothing else is available , and interact with this projected data .
Some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it rather than the most ecologically responsible choice .
Thank you .
Have you ever wondered what animals think and feel ?
Let &apos;s start with a question : Does my dog really love me , or does she just want a treat ?
Well , it &apos;s easy to see that our dog really loves us , easy to see , right , what &apos;s going on in that fuzzy little head .
What is going on ?
Something &apos;s going on .
But why is the question always do they love us ?
Why is it always about us ?
Why are we such narcissists ?
I found a different question to ask animals .
Who are you ?
There are capacities of the human mind that we tend to think are capacities only of the human mind .
But is that true ?
What are other beings doing with those brains ?
What are they thinking and feeling ?
Is there a way to know ?
I think there is a way in .
I think there are several ways in .
We can look at evolution , we can look at their brains and we can watch what they do .
The first thing to remember is : our brain is inherited .
The first neurons came from jellyfish .
Jellyfish gave rise to the first chordates .
The first chordates gave rise to the first vertebrates .
The vertebrates came out of the sea , and here we are .
But it &apos;s still true that a neuron , a nerve cell , looks the same in a crayfish , a bird or you .
What does that say about the minds of crayfish ?
Can we tell anything about that ?
Well , it turns out that if you give a crayfish a lot of little tiny electric shocks every time it tries to come out of its burrow , it will develop anxiety .
If you give the crayfish the same drug used to treat anxiety disorder in humans , it relaxes and comes out and explores .
How do we show how much we care about crayfish anxiety ?
Mostly , we boil them .
( Laughter ) Octopuses use tools , as well as do most apes and they recognize human faces .
How do we celebrate the ape-like intelligence of this invertebrate ?
Mostly boiled .
If a grouper chases a fish into a crevice in the coral , it will sometimes go to where it knows a moray eel is sleeping and it will signal to the moray , &quot; &quot; Follow me , &quot; &quot; and the moray will understand that signal .
The moray may go into the crevice and get the fish , but the fish may bolt and the grouper may get it .
This is an ancient partnership that we have just recently found out about .
How do we celebrate that ancient partnership ?
Mostly fried .
A pattern is emerging and it says a lot more about us than it does about them .
Sea otters use tools and they take time away from what they &apos;re doing to show their babies what to do , which is called teaching .
Chimpanzees don &apos;t teach .
Killer whales teach and killer whales share food .
When evolution makes something new , it uses the parts it has in stock , off the shelf , before it fabricates a new twist .
And our brain has come to us through the enormity of the deep sweep of time .
If you look at the human brain compared to a chimpanzee brain , what you see is we have basically a very big chimpanzee brain .
It &apos;s a good thing ours is bigger , because we &apos;re also really insecure .
( Laughter ) But , uh oh , there &apos;s a dolphin , a bigger brain with more convolutions .
OK , maybe you &apos;re saying , all right , well , we see brains , but what does that have to say about minds ?
Well , we can see the working of the mind in the logic of behaviors .
So these elephants , you can see , obviously , they are resting .
They have found a patch of shade under the palm trees under which to let their babies sleep , while they doze but remain vigilant .
We make perfect sense of that image just as they make perfect sense of what they &apos;re doing because under the arc of the same sun on the same plains , listening to the howls of the same dangers , they became who they are and we became who we are .
We &apos;ve been neighbors for a very long time .
No one would mistake these elephants as being relaxed .
They &apos;re obviously very concerned about something .
What are they concerned about ?
It turns out that if you record the voices of tourists and you play that recording from a speaker hidden in bushes , elephants will ignore it , because tourists never bother elephants .
But if you record the voices of herders who carry spears and often hurt elephants in confrontations at water holes , the elephants will bunch up and run away from the hidden speaker .
Not only do elephants know that there are humans , they know that there are different kinds of humans , and that some are OK and some are dangerous .
They have been watching us for much longer than we have been watching them .
They know us better than we know them .
We have the same imperatives : take care of our babies , find food , try to stay alive .
Whether we &apos;re outfitted for hiking in the hills of Africa or outfitted for diving under the sea , we are basically the same .
We are kin under the skin .
The elephant has the same skeleton , the killer whale has the same skeleton , as do we .
We see helping where help is needed .
We see curiosity in the young .
We see the bonds of family connections .
We recognize affection .
Courtship is courtship .
And then we ask , &quot; &quot; Are they conscious ? &quot; &quot; When you get general anesthesia , it makes you unconscious , which means you have no sensation of anything .
Consciousness is simply the thing that feels like something .
If you see , if you hear , if you feel , if you &apos;re aware of anything , you are conscious , and they are conscious .
Some people say well , there are certain things that make humans humans , and one of those things is empathy .
Empathy is the mind &apos;s ability to match moods with your companions .
It &apos;s a very useful thing .
If your companions start to move quickly , you have to feel like you need to hurry up .
The oldest form of empathy is contagious fear .
If your companions suddenly startle and fly away , it does not work very well for you to say , &quot; Jeez , I wonder why everybody just left . &quot;
( Laughter ) Empathy is old , but empathy , like everything else in life , comes on a sliding scale and has its elaboration .
So there &apos;s basic empathy : you feel sad , it makes me sad .
I see you happy , it makes me happy .
Then there &apos;s something that I call sympathy , a little more removed : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry to hear that your grandmother has just passed away .
I don &apos;t feel that same grief , but I get it ; I know what you feel and it concerns me . &quot; &quot; And then if we &apos;re motivated to act on sympathy , I call that compassion .
Far from being the thing that makes us human , human empathy is far from perfect .
We round up empathic creatures , we kill them and we eat them .
Now , maybe you say OK , well , those are different species .
That &apos;s just predation , and humans are predators .
But we don &apos;t treat our own kind too well either .
People who seem to know only one thing about animal behavior know that you must never attribute human thoughts and emotions to other species .
Well , I think that &apos;s silly , because attributing human thoughts and emotions to other species is the best first guess about what they &apos;re doing and how they &apos;re feeling , because their brains are basically the same as ours .
They have the same structures .
The same hormones that create mood and motivation in us are in those brains as well .
It is not scientific to say that they are hungry when they &apos;re hunting and they &apos;re tired when their tongues are hanging out , and then say when they &apos;re playing with their children and acting joyful and happy , we have no idea if they can possibly be experiencing anything .
That is not scientific .
So OK , so a reporter said to me , &quot; Maybe , but how do you really know that other animals can think and feel ? &quot;
And I started to rifle through all the hundreds of scientific references that I put in my book and I realized that the answer was right in the room with me .
When my dog gets off the rug and comes over to me — not to the couch , to me — and she rolls over on her back and exposes her belly , she has had the thought , &quot; &quot; I would like my belly rubbed .
I know that I can go over to Carl , he will understand what I &apos;m asking .
I know I can trust him because we &apos;re family .
He &apos;ll get the job done , and it will feel good . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) She has thought and she has felt , and it &apos;s really not more complicated than that .
But we see other animals and we say , &quot; &quot; Oh look , killer whales , wolves , elephants : that &apos;s not how they see it . &quot; &quot; That tall-finned male is L41 .
He &apos;s 38 years old .
The female right on his left side is L22 .
She &apos;s 44 .
They &apos;ve known each other for decades .
They know exactly who they are .
They know who their friends are .
They know who their rivals are .
Their life follows the arc of a career .
They know where they are all the time .
This is an elephant named Philo .
He was a young male .
This is him four days later .
Humans not only can feel grief , we create an awful lot of it .
We want to carve their teeth .
Why can &apos;t we wait for them to die ?
Elephants once ranged from the shores of the Mediterranean Sea all the way down to the Cape of Good Hope .
In 1980 , there were vast strongholds of elephant range in Central and Eastern Africa .
And now their range is shattered into little shards .
This is the geography of an animal that we are driving to extinction , a fellow being , the most magnificent creature on land .
Of course , we take much better care of our wildlife in the United States .
In Yellowstone National Park , we killed every single wolf .
We killed every single wolf south of the Canadian border , actually .
But in the park , park rangers did that in the 1920s , and then 60 years later they had to bring them back , because the elk numbers had gotten out of control .
And then people came .
People came by the thousands to see the wolves , the most accessibly visible wolves in the world .
And I went there and I watched this incredible family of wolves .
A pack is a family .
It has some breeding adults and the young of several generations .
And I watched the most famous , most stable pack in Yellowstone National Park .
And then , when they wandered just outside the border , two of their adults were killed , including the mother , which we sometimes call the alpha female .
The rest of the family immediately descended into sibling rivalry .
Sisters kicked out other sisters .
That one on the left tried for days to rejoin her family .
They wouldn &apos;t let her because they were jealous of her .
She was getting too much attention from two new males , and she was the precocious one .
That was too much for them .
She wound up wandering outside the park and getting shot .
The alpha male wound up being ejected from his own family .
As winter was coming in , he lost his territory , his hunting support , the members of his family and his mate .
We cause so much pain to them .
The mystery is , why don &apos;t they hurt us more than they do ?
This whale had just finished eating part of a grey whale with his companions who had killed that whale .
Those people in the boat had nothing at all to fear .
This whale is T20 .
He had just finished tearing a seal into three pieces with two companions .
The seal weighed about as much as the people in the boat .
They had nothing to fear .
They eat seals .
Why don &apos;t they eat us ?
Why can we trust them around our toddlers ?
Why is it that killer whales have returned to researchers lost in thick fog and led them miles until the fog parted and the researchers &apos; home was right there on the shoreline ?
And that &apos;s happened more than one time .
In the Bahamas , there &apos;s a woman named Denise Herzing , and she studies spotted dolphins and they know her .
She knows them very well . She knows who they all are .
They know her . They recognize the research boat .
When she shows up , it &apos;s a big happy reunion .
Except , one time showed up and they didn &apos;t want to come near the boat , and that was really strange .
And they couldn &apos;t figure out what was going on until somebody came out on deck and announced that one of the people onboard had died during a nap in his bunk .
How could dolphins know that one of the human hearts had just stopped ?
Why would they care ?
And why would it spook them ?
These mysterious things just hint at all of the things that are going on in the minds that are with us on Earth that we almost never think about at all .
At an aquarium in South Africa was a little baby bottle-nosed dolphin named Dolly .
She was nursing , and one day a keeper took a cigarette break and he was looking into the window into their pool , smoking .
Dolly came over and looked at him , went back to her mother , nursed for a minute or two , came back to the window and released a cloud of milk that enveloped her head like smoke .
Somehow , this baby bottle-nosed dolphin got the idea of using milk to represent smoke .
When human beings use one thing to represent another , we call that art .
( Laughter ) The things that make us human are not the things that we think make us human .
What makes us human is that , of all these things that our minds and their minds have , we are the most extreme .
We are the most compassionate , most violent , most creative and most destructive animal that has ever been on this planet , and we are all of those things all jumbled up together .
But love is not the thing that makes us human .
It &apos;s not special to us .
We are not the only ones who care about our mates .
We are not the only ones who care about our children .
Albatrosses frequently fly six , sometimes ten thousand miles over several weeks to deliver one meal , one big meal , to their chick who is waiting for them .
They nest on the most remote islands in the oceans of the world , and this is what it looks like .
Passing life from one generation to the next is the chain of being .
If that stops , it all goes away .
If anything is sacred , that is , and into that sacred relationship comes our plastic trash .
All of these birds have plastic in them now .
This is an albatross six months old , ready to fledge — died , packed with red cigarette lighters .
This is not the relationship we are supposed to have with the rest of the world .
But we , who have named ourselves after our brains , never think about the consequences .
When we welcome new human life into the world , we welcome our babies into the company of other creatures .
We paint animals on the walls .
We don &apos;t paint cell phones .
We don &apos;t paint work cubicles .
We paint animals to show them that we are not alone .
We have company .
And every one of those animals in every painting of Noah &apos;s ark , deemed worthy of salvation is in mortal danger now , and their flood is us .
So we started with a question : Do they love us ?
We &apos;re going to ask another question .
Are we capable of using what we have to care enough to simply let them continue ?
Thank you very much .

The idea behind the Stuxnet computer worm is actually quite simple .
We don &apos;t want Iran to get the bomb .
Their major asset for developing nuclear weapons is the Natanz uranium enrichment facility .
The gray boxes that you see , these are real-time control systems .
Now if we manage to compromise these systems that control drive speeds and valves , we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
The gray boxes don &apos;t run Windows software ; they are a completely different technology .
But if we manage to place a good Windows virus on a notebook that is used by a maintenance engineer to configure this gray box , then we are in business .
And this is the plot behind Stuxnet .
So we start with a Windows dropper .
When we started our research on Stuxnet six months ago , it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was .
The only thing that was known is it &apos;s very , very complex on the Windows part , the dropper part , used multiple zero-day vulnerabilities .
And it seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes , these real-time control systems .
So that got our attention , and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with Stuxnet and checked this thing out .
And then some very funny things happened .
Stuxnet behaved like a lab rat that didn &apos;t like our cheese — sniffed , but didn &apos;t want to eat .
Didn &apos;t make sense to me .
And after we experimented with different flavors of cheese , I realized , well , this is a directed attack .
It &apos;s completely directed .
The dropper is prowling actively on the gray box if a specific configuration is found , and even if the actual program code that it &apos;s trying to infect is actually running on that target .
And if not , Stuxnet does nothing .
So that really got my attention , and we started to work on this nearly around the clock , because I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , we don &apos;t know what the target is .
It could be , let &apos;s say for example , a U.S. power plant , or a chemical plant in Germany .
So we better find out what the target is soon . &quot; &quot; So we extracted and decompiled the attack code , and we discovered that it &apos;s structured in two digital bombs — a smaller one and a bigger one .
And we also saw that they are very professionally engineered by people who obviously had all insider information .
They knew all the bits and bites that they had to attack .
They probably even know the shoe size of the operator .
So they know everything .
And if you have heard that the dropper of Stuxnet is complex and high-tech , let me tell you this : the payload is rocket science .
It &apos;s way above everything that we have ever seen before .
Here you see a sample of this actual attack code .
We are talking about — around about 15,000 lines of code .
Looks pretty much like old-style assembly language .
And I want to tell you how we were able to make sense out of this code .
So what we were looking for is , first of all , system function calls , because we know what they do .
And then we were looking for timers and data structures and trying to relate them to the real world — to potential real world targets .
So we do need target theories that we can prove or disprove .
In order to get target theories , we remember that it &apos;s definitely hardcore sabotage , it must be a high-value target and it is most likely located in Iran , because that &apos;s where most of the infections had been reported .
Now you don &apos;t find several thousand targets in that area .
It basically boils down to the Bushehr nuclear power plant and to the Natanz fuel enrichment plant .
So I told my assistant , &quot; Get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base . &quot;
And I phoned them up and picked their brain in an effort to match their expertise with what we found in code and data .
And that worked pretty well .
So we were able to associate the small digital warhead with the rotor control .
The rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge , that black object that you see .
And if you manipulate the speed of this rotor , you are actually able to crack the rotor and eventually even have the centrifuge explode .
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and creepy — obviously in an effort to drive maintenance engineers crazy , that they would not be able to figure this out quickly .
The big digital warhead — we had a shot at this by looking very closely at data and data structures .
So for example , the number 164 really stands out in that code ; you can &apos;t overlook it .
I started to research scientific literature on how these centrifuges are actually built in Natanz and found they are structured in what is called a cascade , and each cascade holds 164 centrifuges .
So that made sense , that was a match .
And it even got better .
These centrifuges in Iran are subdivided into 15 , what is called , stages .
And guess what we found in the attack code ?
An almost identical structure .
So again , that was a real good match .
And this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at .
Now don &apos;t get me wrong here , it didn &apos;t go like this .
These results have been obtained over several weeks of really hard labor .
And we often went into just a dead end and had to recover .
Anyway , so we figured out that both digital warheads were actually aiming at one and the same target , but from different angles .
The small warhead is taking one cascade , and spinning up the rotors and slowing them down , and the big warhead is talking to six cascades and manipulating valves .
So in all , we are very confident that we have actually determined what the target is .
It is Natanz , and it is only Natanz .
So we don &apos;t have to worry that other targets might be hit by Stuxnet .
Here &apos;s some very cool stuff that we saw — really knocked my socks off .
Down there is the gray box , and on the top you see the centrifuges .
Now what this thing does is it intercepts the input values from sensors — so for example , from pressure sensors and vibration sensors — and it provides legitimate program code , which is still running during the attack , with fake input data .
And as a matter of fact , this fake input data is actually prerecorded by Stuxnet .
So it &apos;s just like from the Hollywood movies where during the heist , the observation camera is fed with prerecorded video .
That &apos;s cool , huh ?
The idea here is obviously not only to fool the operators in the control room .
It actually is much more dangerous and aggressive .
The idea is to circumvent a digital safety system .
We need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act quick enough .
So for example , in a power plant , when your big steam turbine gets too over speed , you must open relief valves within a millisecond .
Obviously , this cannot be done by a human operator .
So this is where we need digital safety systems .
And when they are compromised , then real bad things can happen .
Your plant can blow up .
And neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it .
That &apos;s scary .
But it gets worse .
And this is very important , what I &apos;m going to say .
Think about this : this attack is generic .
It doesn &apos;t have anything to do , in specifics , with centrifuges , with uranium enrichment .
So it would work as well , for example , in a power plant or in an automobile factory .
It is generic .
And you don &apos;t have — as an attacker — you don &apos;t have to deliver this payload by a USB stick , as we saw it in the case of Stuxnet .
You could also use conventional worm technology for spreading .
Just spread it as wide as possible .
And if you do that , what you end up with is a cyber weapon of mass destruction .
That &apos;s the consequence that we have to face .
So unfortunately , the biggest number of targets for such attacks are not in the Middle East .
They &apos;re in the United States and Europe and in Japan .
So all of the green areas , these are your target-rich environments .
We have to face the consequences , and we better start to prepare right now .
Thanks .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : I &apos;ve got a question .
Ralph , it &apos;s been quite widely reported that people assume that Mossad is the main entity behind this .
Is that your opinion ?
Ralph Langner : Okay , you really want to hear that ?
Yeah . Okay .
My opinion is that the Mossad is involved , but that the leading force is not Israel .
So the leading force behind that is the cyber superpower .
There is only one , and that &apos;s the United States — fortunately , fortunately .
Because otherwise , our problems would even be bigger .
CA : Thank you for scaring the living daylights out of us . Thank you , Ralph .
That &apos;s the million-dollar question , right ?
And why is the forbidden so erotic ?
What is it about transgression that makes desire so potent ?
And when you desire , how is it different ?
So what sustains desire , and why is it so difficult ?
All these anchoring , grounding experiences of our lives that we call home .
Give me novelty , give me familiarity .
So why does good sex so often fade ?
What is the relationship between love and desire ?
How do they relate , and how do they conflict ?
We want to neutralize the tensions .
Forgone conclusion does not keep our interest .
Or in other words , I sometimes say , fire needs air .
Desire needs space .
But then I took a question with me .
But then the second group is even more interesting .
Probably the biggest turn-on across the board .
Because sometimes , as Proust says , mystery is not about traveling to new places , but it &apos;s about looking with new eyes .
Nobody needs anybody .
There is no caretaking in desire .
Wanting them is one thing .
But novelty isn &apos;t about new positions .
Because in some way one could say sex isn &apos;t something you do , eh ?
Sex is a place you go .
Is it a place where you can finally surrender and not have to take responsibility for everything ?
It isn &apos;t just a behavior .
So when I began to think about eroticism , I began to think about the poetics of sex .
&quot; I turn off my desires when ... &quot;
You know , the erotic mind is not very politically correct .
Translate this into adult language .
It starts very young .
Are you going to curse me , scold me ?
So what happens , if you want to sustain desire , it &apos;s that real dialectic piece .
On the one hand you want the security in order to be able to go .
They also understand that foreplay is not something you do five minutes before the real thing .
Responsibility and desire just butt heads .
They don &apos;t really do well together .
It &apos;s pretty much like the moon .
But what they know is they know how to resurrect it .
They know how to bring it back .
Committed sex is premeditated sex .
I &apos;m here today to talk about a disturbing question , which has an equally disturbing answer .
My topic is the secrets of domestic violence , and the question I &apos;m going to tackle is the one question everyone always asks : Why does she stay ?
Why would anyone stay with a man who beats her ?
I &apos;m not a psychiatrist , a social worker or an expert in domestic violence .
I &apos;m just one woman with a story to tell .
I was 22 . I had just graduated from Harvard College .
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at Seventeen magazine .
I had my first apartment , my first little green American Express card , and I had a very big secret .
My secret was that I had this gun loaded with hollow-point bullets pointed at my head by the man who I thought was my soulmate , many , many times .
The man who I loved more than anybody on Earth held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me more times than I can even remember .
I &apos;m here to tell you the story of crazy love , a psychological trap disguised as love , one that millions of women and even a few men fall into every year .
It may even be your story .
I don &apos;t look like a typical domestic violence survivor .
I have a B.A. in English from Harvard College , an MBA in marketing from Wharton Business School .
I &apos;ve spent most of my career working for Fortune 500 companies including Johnson &amp; Johnson , Leo Burnett and The Washington Post .
I &apos;ve been married for almost 20 years to my second husband and we have three kids together .
My dog is a black lab , and I drive a Honda Odyssey minivan .
( Laughter ) So my first message for you is that domestic violence happens to everyone — all races , all religions , all income and education levels .
It &apos;s everywhere .
And my second message is that everyone thinks domestic violence happens to women , that it &apos;s a women &apos;s issue .
Not exactly .
Over 85 percent of abusers are men , and domestic abuse happens only in intimate , interdependent , long-term relationships , in other words , in families , the last place we would want or expect to find violence , which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing .
I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth who would stay with a man who beats me , but in fact I was a very typical victim because of my age .
I was 22 , and in the United States , women ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely to be domestic violence victims as women of other ages , and over 500 women and girls this age are killed every year by abusive partners , boyfriends , and husbands in the United States .
I was also a very typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence , its warning signs or its patterns .
I met Conor on a cold , rainy January night .
He sat next to me on the New York City subway , and he started chatting me up .
He told me two things .
One was that he , too , had just graduated from an Ivy League school , and that he worked at a very impressive Wall Street bank .
But what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting was that he was smart and funny and he looked like a farm boy .
He had these big cheeks , these big apple cheeks and this wheat-blond hair , and he seemed so sweet .
One of the smartest things Conor did , from the very beginning , was to create the illusion that I was the dominant partner in the relationship .
He did this especially at the beginning by idolizing me .
We started dating , and he loved everything about me , that I was smart , that I &apos;d gone to Harvard , that I was passionate about helping teenage girls , and my job .
He wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood and my hopes and dreams .
Conor believed in me , as a writer and a woman , in a way that no one else ever had .
And he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us by confessing his secret , which was that , as a very young boy starting at age four , he had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused by his stepfather , and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade , even though he was very smart , and he &apos;d spent almost 20 years rebuilding his life .
Which is why that Ivy League degree and the Wall Street job and his bright shiny future meant so much to him .
If you had told me that this smart , funny , sensitive man who adored me would one day dictate whether or not I wore makeup , how short my skirts were , where I lived , what jobs I took , who my friends were and where I spent Christmas , I would have laughed at you , because there was not a hint of violence or control or anger in Conor at the beginning .
I didn &apos;t know that the first stage in any domestic violence relationship is to seduce and charm the victim .
I also didn &apos;t know that the second step is to isolate the victim .
Now , Conor did not come home one day and announce , &quot; &quot; You know , hey , all this Romeo and Juliet stuff has been great , but I need to move into the next phase where I isolate you and I abuse you &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; &quot; so I need to get you out of this apartment where the neighbors can hear you scream and out of this city where you have friends and family and coworkers who can see the bruises . &quot; &quot; Instead , Conor came home one Friday evening and he told me that he had quit his job that day , his dream job , and he said that he had quit his job because of me ,
because I had made him feel so safe and loved that he didn &apos;t need to prove himself on Wall Street anymore , and he just wanted to get out of the city and away from his abusive , dysfunctional family , and move to a tiny town in New England where he could start his life over with me by his side .
Now , the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York , and my dream job , but I thought you made sacrifices for your soulmate , so I agreed , and I quit my job , and Conor and I left Manhattan together .
I had no idea I was falling into crazy love , that I was walking headfirst into a carefully laid physical , financial and psychological trap .
The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence and see how she reacts .
And here &apos;s where those guns come in .
As soon as we moved to New England — you know , that place where Connor was supposed to feel so safe — he bought three guns .
He kept one in the glove compartment of our car .
He kept one under the pillows on our bed , and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times .
And he said that he needed those guns because of the trauma he &apos;d experienced as a young boy .
He needed them to feel protected .
But those guns were really a message for me , and even though he hadn &apos;t raised a hand to me , my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day .
Conor first physically attacked me five days before our wedding .
It was 7 a.m. I still had on my nightgown .
I was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment , and I got frustrated , and Conor used my anger as an excuse to put both of his hands around my neck and to squeeze so tightly that I could not breathe or scream , and he used the chokehold to hit my head repeatedly against the wall .
Five days later , the ten bruises on my neck had just faded , and I put on my mother &apos;s wedding dress , and I married him .
Despite what had happened , I was sure we were going to live happily ever after , because I loved him , and he loved me so much .
And he was very , very sorry .
He had just been really stressed out by the wedding and by becoming a family with me .
It was an isolated incident , and he was never going to hurt me again .
It happened twice more on the honeymoon .
The first time , I was driving to find a secret beach and I got lost , and he punched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head repeatedly hit the driver &apos;s side window .
And then a few days later , driving home from our honeymoon , he got frustrated by traffic , and he threw a cold Big Mac in my face .
Conor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage .
I was mistaken in thinking that I was unique and alone in this situation .
One in three American women experiences domestic violence or stalking at some point in her life , and the CDC reports that 15 million children are abused every year , 15 million .
So actually , I was in very good company .
Back to my question : Why did I stay ?
The answer is easy .
I didn &apos;t know he was abusing me .
Even though he held those loaded guns to my head , pushed me down stairs , threatened to kill our dog , pulled the key out of the car ignition as I drove down the highway , poured coffee grinds on my head as I dressed for a job interview , I never once thought of myself as a battered wife .
Instead , I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply troubled man , and I was the only person on Earth who could help Conor face his demons .
The other question everybody asks is , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?
Why didn &apos;t I walk out ? I could have left any time .
To me , this is the saddest and most painful question that people ask , because we victims know something you usually don &apos;t : It &apos;s incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser .
Because the final step in the domestic violence pattern is kill her .
Over 70 percent of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has ended the relationship , after she &apos;s gotten out , because then the abuser has nothing left to lose .
Other outcomes include long-term stalking , even after the abuser remarries ; denial of financial resources ; and manipulation of the family court system to terrify the victim and her children , who are regularly forced by family court judges to spend unsupervised time with the man who beat their mother .
And still we ask , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?
I was able to leave , because of one final , sadistic beating that broke through my denial .
I realized that the man who I loved so much was going to kill me if I let him .
So I broke the silence .
I told everyone : the police , my neighbors , my friends and family , total strangers , and I &apos;m here today because you all helped me .
We tend to stereotype victims as grisly headlines , self-destructive women , damaged goods .
The question , &quot; &quot; Why does she stay ? &quot; &quot; is code for some people for , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s her fault for staying , &quot; &quot; as if victims intentionally choose to fall in love with men intent upon destroying us .
But since publishing &quot; &quot; Crazy Love , &quot; &quot; I have heard hundreds of stories from men and women who also got out , who learned an invaluable life lesson from what happened , and who rebuilt lives — joyous , happy lives — as employees , wives and mothers , lives completely free of violence , like me .
Because it turns out that I &apos;m actually a very typical domestic violence victim and a typical domestic violence survivor .
I remarried a kind and gentle man , and we have those three kids .
I have that black lab , and I have that minivan .
What I will never have again , ever , is a loaded gun held to my head by someone who says that he loves me .
Right now , maybe you &apos;re thinking , &quot; Wow , this is fascinating , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; Wow , how stupid was she , &quot; &quot; but this whole time , I &apos;ve actually been talking about you .
I promise you there are several people listening to me right now who are currently being abused or who were abused as children or who are abusers themselves .
Abuse could be affecting your daughter , your sister , your best friend right now .
I was able to end my own crazy love story by breaking the silence .
I &apos;m still breaking the silence today .
It &apos;s my way of helping other victims , and it &apos;s my final request of you .
Talk about what you heard here .
Abuse thrives only in silence .
You have the power to end domestic violence simply by shining a spotlight on it .
We victims need everyone .
We need every one of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence .
Show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children , your coworkers , your friends and family .
Recast survivors as wonderful , lovable people with full futures .
Recognize the early signs of violence and conscientiously intervene , deescalate it , show victims a safe way out .
Together we can make our beds , our dinner tables and our families the safe and peaceful oases they should be .
Thank you .
( Applause )
This is from Marlboro country .
And the night before , we camped , and my Tibetan friends said , &quot; We are going to sleep outside . &quot;
It &apos;s about two meters by three , and you are all welcome any time .
One of the most common ones is happiness and pleasure .
It is something that — changes of nature .
I used to be a fan of Bach .
And also , again , it can — also , it &apos;s something that you — it is not something that is radiating outside .
And happiness , of course , is such a vague word , so let &apos;s say well-being .
Look at the waves coming near the shore .
It can only be a state of being , not just a fleeting emotion , sensation .
Is change possible in our emotions , in our traits , in our moods ?
You can have ugly faces , beautiful faces in the mirror .
But , of course , each emotion then would need a particular antidote .
Another way is to try to find a general antidote to all emotions , and that &apos;s by looking at the very nature .
So that &apos;s what those great meditators have been doing .
It &apos;s something that is totally out of the bell curve .
Hopefully , they will come .
So the whole point of that is not , sort of , to make , like , a circus thing of showing exceptional beings who can jump , or whatever .
We love to do jogging , fitness .
We do all kinds of things to remain beautiful .
Just this one example is worth a lot of work .
Different schools and clinics we &apos;ve been doing in Tibet .
Flying monks .
So I know TED is about a lot of things that are big , but I want to talk to you about something very small .
So small , it &apos;s a single word .
The word is &quot; &quot; misfit . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s one of my favorite words , because it &apos;s so literal .
I mean , it &apos;s a person who sort of missed fitting in .
Or a person who fits in badly .
Or this : &quot; &quot; a person who is poorly adapted to new situations and environments . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a card-carrying misfit .
And I &apos;m here for the other misfits in the room , because I &apos;m never the only one .
I &apos;m going to tell you a misfit story .
Somewhere in my early 30s , the dream of becoming a writer came right to my doorstep .
Actually , it came to my mailbox in the form of a letter that said I &apos;d won a giant literary prize for a short story I had written .
The short story was about my life as a competitive swimmer and about my crappy home life , and a little bit about how grief and loss can make you insane .
The prize was a trip to New York City to meet big-time editors and agents and other authors .
So kind of it was the wannabe writer &apos;s dream , right ?
You know what I did the day the letter came to my house ?
Because I &apos;m me , I put the letter on my kitchen table , I poured myself a giant glass of vodka with ice and lime , and I sat there in my underwear for an entire day , just staring at the letter .
I was thinking about all the ways I &apos;d already screwed my life up .
Who the hell was I to go to New York City and pretend to be a writer ?
Who was I ?
I &apos;ll tell you .
I was a misfit .
Like legions of other children , I came from an abusive household that I narrowly escaped with my life .
I already had two epically failed marriages underneath my belt .
I &apos;d flunked out of college not once but twice and maybe even a third time that I &apos;m not going to tell you about .
( Laughter ) And I &apos;d done an episode of rehab for drug use .
And I &apos;d had two lovely staycations in jail .
So I &apos;m on the right stage .
( Laughter ) But the real reason , I think , I was a misfit , is that my daughter died the day she was born , and I hadn &apos;t figured out how to live with that story yet .
After my daughter died I also spent a long time homeless , living under an overpass in a kind of profound state of zombie grief and loss that some of us encounter along the way .
Maybe all of us , if you live long enough .
You know , homeless people are some of our most heroic misfits , because they start out as us .
So you see , I &apos;d missed fitting in to just about every category out there : daughter , wife , mother , scholar .
And the dream of being a writer was really kind of like a small , sad stone in my throat .
It was pretty much in spite of myself that I got on that plane and flew to New York City , where the writers are .
Fellow misfits , I can almost see your heads glowing .
I can pick you out of a room .
At first , you would &apos;ve loved it .
You got to choose the three famous writers you wanted to meet , and these guys went and found them for you .
You got set up at the Gramercy Park Hotel , where you got to drink Scotch late in the night with cool , smart , swank people .
And you got to pretend you were cool and smart and swank , too .
And you got to meet a bunch of editors and authors and agents at very , very fancy lunches and dinners .
Ask me how fancy .
Audience : How fancy ?
Lidia Yuknavitch : I &apos;m making a confession : I stole three linen napkins — ( Laughter ) from three different restaurants .
And I shoved a menu down my pants .
( Laughter ) I just wanted some keepsakes so that when I got home , I could believe it had really happened to me .
You know ?
The three writers I wanted to meet were Carole Maso , Lynne Tillman and Peggy Phelan .
These were not famous , best-selling authors , but to me , they were women-writer titans .
Carole Maso wrote the book that later became my art bible .
Lynne Tillman gave me permission to believe that there was a chance my stories could be part of the world .
And Peggy Phelan reminded me that maybe my brains could be more important than my boobs .
They weren &apos;t mainstream women writers , but they were cutting a path through the mainstream with their body stories , I like to think , kind of the way water cut the Grand Canyon .
It nearly killed me with joy to hang out with these three over-50-year-old women writers .
And the reason it nearly killed me with joy is that I &apos;d never known a joy like that .
I &apos;d never been in a room like that .
My mother never went to college .
And my creative career to that point was a sort of small , sad , stillborn thing .
So kind of in those first nights in New York I wanted to die there .
I was just like , &quot; &quot; Kill me now . I &apos;m good . This is beautiful . &quot; &quot; Some of you in the room will understand what happened next .
First , they took me to the offices of Farrar , Straus and Giroux .
Farrar , Straus and Giroux was like my mega-dream press .
I mean , T.S. Eliot and Flannery O &apos;Connor were published there .
The main editor guy sat me down and talked to me for a long time , trying to convince me I had a book in me about my life as a swimmer .
You know , like a memoir .
The whole time he was talking to me , I sat there smiling and nodding like a numb idiot , with my arms crossed over my chest , while nothing , nothing , nothing came out of my throat .
So in the end , he patted me on the shoulder like a swim coach might .
And he wished me luck and he gave me some free books and he showed me out the door .
Next , they took me to the offices of W.W. Norton , where I was pretty sure I &apos;d be escorted from the building just for wearing Doc Martens .
But that didn &apos;t happen .
Being at the Norton offices felt like reaching up into the night sky and touching the moon while the stars stitched your name across the cosmos .
I mean , that &apos;s how big a deal it was to me .
You get it ?
Their lead editor , Carol Houck Smith , leaned over right in my face with these beady , bright , fierce eyes and said , &quot; &quot; Well , send me something then , immediately ! &quot; &quot; See , now most people , especially TED people , would have run to the mailbox , right ?
It took me over a decade to even imagine putting something in an envelope and licking a stamp .
On the last night , I gave a big reading at the National Poetry Club .
And at the end of the reading , Katharine Kidde of Kidde , Hoyt &amp; Picard Literary Agency , walked straight up to me and shook my hand and offered me representation , like , on the spot .
I stood there and I kind of went deaf .
Has this ever happened to you ?
And I almost started crying because all the people in the room were dressed so beautifully , and all that came out of my mouth was : &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have to think about it . &quot;
And she said , &quot; &quot; OK , then , &quot; &quot; and walked away .
All those open hands out to me , that small , sad stone in my throat ...
You see , I &apos;m trying to tell you something about people like me .
Misfit people — we don &apos;t always know how to hope or say yes or choose the big thing , even when it &apos;s right in front of us .
It &apos;s a shame we carry .
It &apos;s the shame of wanting something good .
It &apos;s the shame of feeling something good .
It &apos;s the shame of not really believing we deserve to be in the room with the people we admire .
If I could , I &apos;d go back and I &apos;d coach myself .
I &apos;d be exactly like those over-50-year-old women who helped me .
I &apos;d teach myself how to want things , how to stand up , how to ask for them .
I &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; You ! Yeah , you ! You belong in the room , too . &quot; &quot; The radiance falls on all of us , and we are nothing without each other .
Instead , I flew back to Oregon , and as I watched the evergreens and rain come back into view , I just drank many tiny bottles of airplane &quot; &quot; feel sorry for yourself . &quot; &quot; I thought about how , if I was a writer , I was some kind of misfit writer .
What I &apos;m saying is , I flew back to Oregon without a book deal , without an agent , and with only a headful and heart-ful of memories of having sat so near the beautiful writers .
Memory was the only prize I allowed myself .
And yet , at home in the dark , back in my underwear , I could still hear their voices .
They said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t listen to anyone who tries to get you to shut up or change your story . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Give voice to the story only you know how to tell . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Sometimes telling the story is the thing that saves your life . &quot; &quot; Now I am , as you can see , the woman over 50 .
And I &apos;m a writer .
And I &apos;m a mother .
And I became a teacher .
Guess who my favorite students are .
All I had to do was give voice to the story .
There &apos;s a myth in most cultures about following your dreams .
It &apos;s called the hero &apos;s journey .
But I prefer a different myth , that &apos;s slightly to the side of that or underneath it .
It &apos;s called the misfit &apos;s myth .
And it goes like this : even at the moment of your failure , right then , you are beautiful .
You don &apos;t know it yet , but you have the ability to reinvent yourself endlessly .
That &apos;s your beauty .
You can be a drunk , you can be a survivor of abuse , you can be an ex-con , you can be a homeless person , you can lose all your money or your job or your husband or your wife , or the worst thing of all , a child .
You can even lose your marbles .
You can be standing dead center in the middle of your failure and still , I &apos;m only here to tell you , you are so beautiful .
Your story deserves to be heard , because you , you rare and phenomenal misfit , you new species , are the only one in the room who can tell the story the way only you would .
And I &apos;d be listening .
Thank you .
This , I think , is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn &apos;t occur to anyone to question it .
This is my supermarket .
One consequence of that , by the way , is that the phone never broke .
We now have an almost unlimited variety of phones , especially in the world of cell phones .
These are cell phones of the future .
My favorite is the middle one — the MP3 player , nose hair trimmer , and crème brûlée torch .
So paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices .
Third : escalation of expectations .
You want button fly or zipper fly ? You want stonewashed or acid-washed ?
I had very low , no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor .
I couldn &apos;t have done better .
With a hundred different kinds of jeans on display , there is no excuse for failure .
And so the net result is that we do better in general , objectively , and we feel worse .
So let me remind you .
There &apos;s some magical amount . I don &apos;t know what it is .
They actually make us worse off .
Thank you very much .
Everybody talks about happiness these days .
I had somebody count the number of books with &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40 , and there were many more .
There is a huge wave of interest in happiness , among researchers .
There is a lot of happiness coaching .
Everybody would like to make people happier .
But in spite of all this flood of work , there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness .
And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps .
This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness , and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as messed up as anybody else is .
The first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity .
It turns out that the word &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; is just not a useful word anymore , because we apply it to too many different things .
I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it , but by and large , this is something that we &apos;ll have to give up and we &apos;ll have to adopt the more complicated view of what well-being is .
The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory ; basically , it &apos;s between being happy in your life , and being happy about your life or happy with your life .
And those are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both lumped in the notion of happiness .
And the third is the focusing illusion , and it &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about any circumstance that affects well-being without distorting its importance .
I mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
There &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
Now , I &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a question-and-answer session after one of my lectures reported a story , and that was a story — He said he &apos;d been listening to a symphony , and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording , there was a dreadful screeching sound .
And then he added , really quite emotionally , it ruined the whole experience .
But it hadn &apos;t .
What it had ruined were the memories of the experience .
He had had the experience .
He had had 20 minutes of glorious music .
They counted for nothing because he was left with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep .
What this is telling us , really , is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves .
There is an experiencing self , who lives in the present and knows the present , is capable of re-living the past , but basically it has only the present .
It &apos;s the experiencing self that the doctor approaches — you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; Does it hurt now when I touch you here ? &quot;
And then there is a remembering self , and the remembering self is the one that keeps score , and maintains the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question , &quot; How have you been feeling lately ? &quot;
or &quot; &quot; How was your trip to Albania ? &quot; &quot; or something like that .
Those are two very different entities , the experiencing self and the remembering self , and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness .
Now , the remembering self is a storyteller .
And that really starts with a basic response of our memories — it starts immediately .
We don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
Our memory tells us stories , that is , what we get to keep from our experiences is a story .
And let me begin with one example .
This is an old study .
Those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure .
I won &apos;t go into detail . It &apos;s no longer painful these days , but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s .
They were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds .
Here are two patients , those are their recordings .
And you are asked , &quot; &quot; Who of them suffered more ? &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s a very easy question .
Clearly , Patient B suffered more — his colonoscopy was longer , and every minute of pain that Patient A had , Patient B had , and more .
But now there is another question : &quot; How much did these patients think they suffered ? &quot;
And here is a surprise .
The surprise is that Patient A had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy than Patient B.
The stories of the colonoscopies were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends .
And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great — but one of them is this distinct ... ( Laughter ) but one of them is distinctly worse than the other .
And the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end ; it &apos;s a bad story .
How do we know that ?
Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy , and much later , too , &quot; How bad was the whole thing , in total ? &quot;
And it was much worse for A than for B , in memory .
Now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self .
From the point of view of the experiencing self , clearly , B had a worse time .
Now , what you could do with Patient A , and we actually ran clinical experiments , and it has been done , and it does work — you could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much .
That will cause the patient to suffer , but just a little and much less than before .
And if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experiencing self of Patient A worse off , and you have the remembering self of Patient A a lot better off , because now you have endowed Patient A with a better story about his experience .
What defines a story ?
And that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we make up .
What defines a story are changes , significant moments and endings .
Endings are very , very important and , in this case , the ending dominated .
Now , the experiencing self lives its life continuously .
It has moments of experience , one after the other .
And you can ask : What happens to these moments ?
And the answer is really straightforward : They are lost forever .
I mean , most of the moments of our life — and I calculated , you know , the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long ; that means that , you know , in a life there are about 600 million of them ; in a month , there are about 600,000 — most of them don &apos;t leave a trace .
Most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self .
And yet , somehow you get the sense that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience is our life .
It &apos;s the finite resource that we &apos;re spending while we &apos;re on this earth .
And how to spend it would seem to be relevant , but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us .
So we have the remembering self and the experiencing self , and they &apos;re really quite distinct .
The biggest difference between them is in the handling of time .
From the point of view of the experiencing self , if you have a vacation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two-week vacation is twice as good as the one-week vacation .
That &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remembering self .
For the remembering self , a two-week vacation is barely better than the one-week vacation because there are no new memories added .
You have not changed the story .
And in this way , time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self ; time has very little impact on the story .
Now , the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories .
It is actually the one that makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two colonoscopies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choose , then the one that chooses is the one that has the memory that is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be chosen .
The experiencing self has no voice in this choice .
We actually don &apos;t choose between experiences , we choose between memories of experiences .
And even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future normally as experiences .
We think of our future as anticipated memories .
And basically you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the remembering self , and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn &apos;t need .
I have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case ; that is , we go on vacations , to a very large extent , in the service of our remembering self .
And this is a bit hard to justify I think .
I mean , how much do we consume our memories ?
That is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the remembering self .
And when I think about that , I think about a vacation we had in Antarctica a few years ago , which was clearly the best vacation I &apos;ve ever had , and I think of it relatively often , relative to how much I think of other vacations .
And I probably have consumed my memories of that three-week trip , I would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
Now , if I had ever opened the folder with the 600 pictures in it , I would have spent another hour .
Now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half .
There seems to be a discrepancy .
Now , I may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little appetite I have for consuming memories , but even if you do more of this , there is a genuine question : Why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences ?
So I want you to think about a thought experiment .
Imagine that for your next vacation , you know that at the end of the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed , and you &apos;ll get an amnesic drug so that you won &apos;t remember anything .
Now , would you choose the same vacation ? ( Laughter ) And if you would choose a different vacation , there is a conflict between your two selves , and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict , and it &apos;s actually not at all obvious , because if you think in terms of time , then you get one answer , and if you think in terms of memories , you might get another answer .
Why do we pick the vacations we do is a problem that confronts us with a choice between the two selves .
Now , the two selves bring up two notions of happiness .
There are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
So you can ask : How happy is the experiencing self ?
And then you would ask : How happy are the moments in the experiencing self &apos;s life ?
And they &apos;re all — happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
What are the emotions that can be measured ?
And , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time .
If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
This is not about how happily a person lives .
It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life .
Very different notion .
Anyone who doesn &apos;t distinguish those notions is going to mess up the study of happiness , and I belong to a crowd of students of well-being , who &apos;ve been messing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way .
The distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years , and there are now efforts to measure the two separately .
The Gallup Organization has a world poll where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences , and there have been other efforts along those lines .
So in recent years , we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves .
And the main lesson I think that we have learned is they are really different .
You can know how satisfied somebody is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happily they &apos;re living their life , and vice versa .
Just to give you a sense of the correlation , the correlation is about .5 .
What that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , &quot; &quot; Oh his father is six feet tall , &quot; &quot; how much would you know about his height ?
Well , you would know something about his height , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
You have that much uncertainty .
If I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self .
So the correlation is low .
We know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self .
We know that money is very important , goals are very important .
We know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like , spending time with people that we like .
There are other pleasures , but this is dominant .
So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
The bottom line of what I &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well-being .
It is a completely different notion .
Now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live .
So , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California , you are not going to get to the correct answer .
When you ask that question , you think people must be happier in California if , say , you live in Ohio .
( Laughter ) And what happens is when you think about living in California , you are thinking of the contrast between California and other places , and that contrast , say , is in climate .
Well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are .
But now , because the reflective self is in charge , you may end up — some people may end up moving to California .
And it &apos;s sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier .
Well , their experiencing self is not going to get happier .
We know that .
But one thing will happen : They will think they are happier , because , when they think about it , they &apos;ll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio , and they will feel they made the right decision .
It is very difficult to think straight about well-being , and I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : Thank you . I &apos;ve got a question for you .
Thank you so much .
Now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that Gallup survey .
Is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now ?
Daniel Kahneman : Sure .
I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey is a number , which we absolutely did not expect to find .
We found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self .
When we looked at how feelings , vary with income .
And it turns out that , below an income of 60,000 dollars a year , for Americans — and that &apos;s a very large sample of Americans , like 600,000 , so it &apos;s a large representative sample — below an income of 600,000 dollars a year ...
CA : 60,000 .
DK : 60,000 .
( Laughter ) 60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get .
Above that , we get an absolutely flat line .
I mean I &apos;ve rarely seen lines so flat .
Clearly , what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness , but lack of money certainly buys you misery , and we can measure that misery very , very clearly .
In terms of the other self , the remembering self , you get a different story .
The more money you earn , the more satisfied you are .
That does not hold for emotions .
CA : But Danny , the whole American endeavor is about life , liberty , the pursuit of happiness .
If people took seriously that finding , I mean , it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about , like for example , taxation policy and so forth .
Is there any chance that politicians , that the country generally , would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it ?
DK : You know I think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy .
The recognition is going to be slow in the United States , no question about that , but in the U.K. , it is happening , and in other countries it is happening .
People are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy .
It &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life evaluation , so we need to have that debate fairly soon .
How to enhance happiness goes very different ways depending on how you think , and whether you think of the remembering self or you think of the experiencing self .
This is going to influence policy , I think , in years to come .
In the United States , efforts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population .
This is going to be , I think , within the next decade or two , part of national statistics .
CA : Well , it seems to me that this issue will — or at least should be — the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years .
Thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics .
Thank you , Danny Kahneman .
It &apos;s like a coin flip ; it doesn &apos;t count , really .
This is the way we treat people as responsible adults .
And I think some people may have misunderstood .
That &apos;s the way evolution works .
Now , maybe we want to treat it as metaphorical .
I &apos;d like to talk to you today about this problem , and how we can fix it with neuroscience .
First , I &apos;d like to take you back to a frosty night in Harlem in 2011 that had a profound impact on me .
I was sitting in a dive bar outside of Columbia University , where I studied computer science and neuroscience , and I was having this great conversation with a fellow student about the power of holograms to one day replace computers .
And just as we were getting to the best part of the conversation , of course , his phone lights up .
And he pulls it towards himself , and he looks down and he starts typing .
And then he forces his eyeballs back up to mine and he goes , &quot; Keep going . I &apos;m with you . &quot;
He was swiping through pictures on Instagram , and these kids were laughing hysterically .
And that dichotomy between how crappy I was feeling and how happy they were feeling about the same technology , really got me thinking .
See , they were connected around something , just like our ancestors who evolved their social cognitions telling stories around the campfire .
And I think computers today are doing quite the opposite .
Whether you &apos;re sending an email to your wife or you &apos;re composing a symphony or just consoling a friend , you &apos;re doing it in pretty much the same way .
You &apos;re hunched over these rectangles , fumbling with buttons and menus and more rectangles .
And I think this is the wrong way , I think we can start using a much more natural machine .
We should use machines that bring our work back into the world .
Now it just so happens that I have such a machine here .
It &apos;s called the Meta 2 .
Let &apos;s try it out .
Now in front of me right now , I can see the audience , and I can see my very hands .
And of course this could be anything that we &apos;re shopping for or learning from , and I can use my hands to very nicely kind of move it around with fine control .
And I think Iron Man would be proud .
We &apos;re going to come back to this in just a bit .
She &apos;s actually touching graphics right now and selecting an interior decor .
This was all shot through a GoPro through our very glasses .
As a neuroscience student , I would always fantasize about the ability to learn and memorize these complex brain structures with an actual machine , where I could touch and play with the various brain structures .
Now what you &apos;re seeing is called augmented reality , but to me , it &apos;s part of a much more important story — a story of how we can begin to extend our bodies with digital devices , instead of the other way around .
Now ...
in the next few years , humanity &apos;s going to go through a shift , I think .
We &apos;re going to start putting an entire layer of digital information on the real world .
Just imagine for a moment what this could mean for storytellers , for painters , for brain surgeons , for interior decorators and maybe for all of us here today .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m very passionate about .
Now , I want to tell you a little secret .
In about five years — this is not the smallest device — in about five years , these are all going to look like strips of glass on our eyes that project holograms .
And just like we don &apos;t care so much about which phone we buy in terms of the hardware — we buy it for the operating system — as a neuroscientist , I always dreamt of building the iOS of the mind , if you will .
And it &apos;s very , very important that we get this right , because we might be living inside of these things for at least as long as we &apos;ve lived with the Windows graphical user interface .
And I don &apos;t know about you , but living inside of Windows scares me .
And the principle we all revolve around is what &apos;s called the &quot; &quot; Neural Path of Least Resistance . &quot; &quot; At every turn , we &apos;re connecting the iOS of the brain with our brain on , for the first time , our brain &apos;s terms .
In other words , we &apos;re trying to create a zero learning-curve computer .
We &apos;re building a system that you &apos;ve always known how to use .
Here are the first three design guidelines that we employ in this brand-new form of user experience .
First and foremost , you are the operating system .
We &apos;re going against the Neural Path of Least Resistance .
Meanwhile , in augmented reality , you can of course place your holographic TED panel over here , and your holographic email on the other side of the desk , and your spatial memory evolved just fine to go ahead and retrieve them .
You could put your holographic Tesla that you &apos;re shopping for — or whatever model my legal team told me to put in right before the show .
The second interface guideline we call &quot; &quot; touch to see . &quot; &quot; What do babies do when they see something that grabs their interest ?
And that &apos;s exactly how the natural machine should work as well .
So by touching our work directly , we &apos;re not only going to control it better , we &apos;re also going to understand it much more deeply .
Hence , touch to see .
But it &apos;s not enough to experience things ourselves .
We &apos;re inherently these social primates .
And this leads me to our third guideline , the holographic campfire from our first story .
Our mirror-neuron subsystem suggests that we can connect with each other and with our work much better if we can see each other &apos;s faces and hands in 3D .
So if you look at the video behind me , you can see two Meta users playing around with the same hologram , making eye contact , connected around this thing , instead of being distracted by external devices .
Let &apos;s go ahead and try this again with neuroscience in mind .
So again , our favorite interface , the iOS of the mind .
I &apos;m going to now take a step further and go ahead and grab this pair of glasses and leave it right here by the desk .
I &apos;m now with you , I &apos;m in the moment , we &apos;re connecting .
My spatial memory kicks in , and I can go ahead and grab it and bring it right back here , reminding me that I am the operating system .
And now my proprioception is working , and I can go ahead and explode these glasses into a thousand parts and touch the very sensor that is currently scanning my hand .
Guys , I can see this guy in front me in full 3D .
And he is photo-realistic .
My mirror-neuron subsystem suggests that this is going to replace phones in not too long .
Ray , how &apos;s it going ?
Ray : Great . We &apos;re live today .
Guys , this is not only going to change phones , it &apos;s also going to change the way we collaborate .
Thank you so much .
Thanks , Ray .
Ray : You &apos;re welcome .
It &apos;s right here , inside of us .
Which is why all hundred of us at Meta , including the administrative staff , the executives , the designers , the engineers — before TED2017 , we &apos;re all going to be throwing away our external monitors and replacing them with a truly and profoundly more natural machine .
Thank you very much .
Thanks , guys .
Chris Anderson : So help me out on one thing , because there &apos;ve been a few augmented reality demos shown over the last year or so out there .
And there &apos;s sometimes a debate among technologists about , are we really seeing the real thing on-screen ?
There &apos;s this issue of field of view , that somehow the technology is showing a broader view than you would actually see wearing the glasses .
Were we seeing the real deal there ?
MG : Absolutely the real deal .
CA : Thank you so much for showing us that .
MG : Thanks so much , I appreciate that .
I &apos;d like to begin with a thought experiment .
Imagine that it &apos;s 4,000 years into the future .
Civilization as we know it has ceased to exist — no books , no electronic devices , no Facebook or Twitter .
All knowledge of the English language and the English alphabet has been lost .
Now imagine archeologists digging through the rubble of one of our cities .
What might they find ?
Well perhaps some rectangular pieces of plastic with strange symbols on them .
Perhaps some circular pieces of metal .
Maybe some cylindrical containers with some symbols on them .
And perhaps one archeologist becomes an instant celebrity when she discovers — buried in the hills somewhere in North America — massive versions of these same symbols .
Now let &apos;s ask ourselves , what could such artifacts say about us to people 4,000 years into the future ?
This is no hypothetical question .
In fact , this is exactly the kind of question we &apos;re faced with when we try to understand the Indus Valley civilization , which existed 4,000 years ago .
The Indus civilization was roughly contemporaneous with the much better known Egyptian and the Mesopotamian civilizations , but it was actually much larger than either of these two civilizations .
It occupied the area of approximately one million square kilometers , covering what is now Pakistan , Northwestern India and parts of Afghanistan and Iran .
Given that it was such a vast civilization , you might expect to find really powerful rulers , kings , and huge monuments glorifying these powerful kings .
In fact , what archeologists have found is none of that .
They &apos;ve found small objects such as these .
Here &apos;s an example of one of these objects .
Well obviously this is a replica .
But who is this person ?
A king ? A god ?
A priest ?
Or perhaps an ordinary person like you or me ?
We don &apos;t know .
But the Indus people also left behind artifacts with writing on them .
Well no , not pieces of plastic , but stone seals , copper tablets , pottery and , surprisingly , one large sign board , which was found buried near the gate of a city .
Now we don &apos;t know if it says Hollywood , or even Bollywood for that matter .
In fact , we don &apos;t even know what any of these objects say , and that &apos;s because the Indus script is undeciphered .
We don &apos;t know what any of these symbols mean .
The symbols are most commonly found on seals .
So you see up there one such object .
It &apos;s the square object with the unicorn-like animal on it .
Now that &apos;s a magnificent piece of art .
So how big do you think that is ?
Perhaps that big ?
Or maybe that big ?
Well let me show you .
Here &apos;s a replica of one such seal .
It &apos;s only about one inch by one inch in size — pretty tiny .
So what were these used for ?
We know that these were used for stamping clay tags that were attached to bundles of goods that were sent from one place to the other .
So you know those packing slips you get on your FedEx boxes ?
These were used to make those kinds of packing slips .
You might wonder what these objects contain in terms of their text .
Perhaps they &apos;re the name of the sender or some information about the goods that are being sent from one place to the other — we don &apos;t know .
We need to decipher the script to answer that question .
Deciphering the script is not just an intellectual puzzle ; it &apos;s actually become a question that &apos;s become deeply intertwined with the politics and the cultural history of South Asia .
In fact , the script has become a battleground of sorts between three different groups of people .
First , there &apos;s a group of people who are very passionate in their belief that the Indus script does not represent a language at all .
These people believe that the symbols are very similar to the kind of symbols you find on traffic signs or the emblems you find on shields .
There &apos;s a second group of people who believe that the Indus script represents an Indo-European language .
If you look at a map of India today , you &apos;ll see that most of the languages spoken in North India belong to the Indo-European language family .
So some people believe that the Indus script represents an ancient Indo-European language such as Sanskrit .
There &apos;s a last group of people who believe that the Indus people were the ancestors of people living in South India today .
These people believe that the Indus script represents an ancient form of the Dravidian language family , which is the language family spoken in much of South India today .
And the proponents of this theory point to that small pocket of Dravidian-speaking people in the North , actually near Afghanistan , and they say that perhaps , sometime in the past , Dravidian languages were spoken all over India and that this suggests that the Indus civilization is perhaps also Dravidian .
Which of these hypotheses can be true ?
We don &apos;t know , but perhaps if you deciphered the script , you would be able to answer this question .
But deciphering the script is a very challenging task .
First , there &apos;s no Rosetta Stone .
I don &apos;t mean the software ; I mean an ancient artifact that contains in the same text both a known text and an unknown text .
We don &apos;t have such an artifact for the Indus script .
And furthermore , we don &apos;t even know what language they spoke .
And to make matters even worse , most of the text that we have are extremely short .
So as I showed you , they &apos;re usually found on these seals that are very , very tiny .
And so given these formidable obstacles , one might wonder and worry whether one will ever be able to decipher the Indus script .
In the rest of my talk , I &apos;d like to tell you about how I learned to stop worrying and love the challenge posed by the Indus script .
I &apos;ve always been fascinated by the Indus script ever since I read about it in a middle school textbook .
And why was I fascinated ?
Well it &apos;s the last major undeciphered script in the ancient world .
My career path led me to become a computational neuroscientist , so in my day job , I create computer models of the brain to try to understand how the brain makes predictions , how the brain makes decisions , how the brain learns and so on .
But in 2007 , my path crossed again with the Indus script .
That &apos;s when I was in India , and I had the wonderful opportunity to meet with some Indian scientists who were using computer models to try to analyze the script .
And so it was then that I realized there was an opportunity for me to collaborate with these scientists , and so I jumped at that opportunity .
And I &apos;d like to describe some of the results that we have found .
Or better yet , let &apos;s all collectively decipher .
Are you ready ?
The first thing that you need to do when you have an undeciphered script is try to figure out the direction of writing .
Here are two texts that contain some symbols on them .
Can you tell me if the direction of writing is right to left or left to right ?
I &apos;ll give you a couple of seconds .
Okay . Right to left , how many ? Okay .
Okay . Left to right ?
Oh , it &apos;s almost 50 / 50 . Okay .
The answer is : if you look at the left-hand side of the two texts , you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a cramping of signs , and it seems like 4,000 years ago , when the scribe was writing from right to left , they ran out of space .
And so they had to cram the sign .
One of the signs is also below the text on the top .
This suggests the direction of writing was probably from right to left , and so that &apos;s one of the first things we know , that directionality is a very key aspect of linguistic scripts .
And the Indus script now has this particular property .
What other properties of language does the script show ?
Languages contain patterns .
If I give you the letter Q and ask you to predict the next letter , what do you think that would be ?
Most of you said U , which is right .
Now if I asked you to predict one more letter , what do you think that would be ?
Now there &apos;s several thoughts . There &apos;s E. It could be I. It could be A , but certainly not B , C or D , right ?
The Indus script also exhibits similar kinds of patterns .
There &apos;s a lot of text that start with this diamond-shaped symbol .
And this in turn tends to be followed by this quotation marks-like symbol .
And this is very similar to a Q and U example .
This symbol can in turn be followed by these fish-like symbols and some other signs , but never by these other signs at the bottom .
And furthermore , there &apos;s some signs that really prefer the end of texts , such as this jar-shaped sign , and this sign , in fact , happens to be the most frequently occurring sign in the script .
Given such patterns , here was our idea .
The idea was to use a computer to learn these patterns , and so we gave the computer the existing texts .
And the computer learned a statistical model of which symbols tend to occur together and which symbols tend to follow each other .
Given the computer model , we can test the model by essentially quizzing it .
So we could deliberately erase some symbols , and we can ask it to predict the missing symbols .
Here are some examples .
You may regard this as perhaps the most ancient game of Wheel of Fortune .
What we found was that the computer was successful in 75 percent of the cases in predicting the correct symbol .
In the rest of the cases , typically the second best guess or third best guess was the right answer .
There &apos;s also practical use for this particular procedure .
There &apos;s a lot of these texts that are damaged .
Here &apos;s an example of one such text .
And we can use the computer model now to try to complete this text and make a best guess prediction .
Here &apos;s an example of a symbol that was predicted .
And this could be really useful as we try to decipher the script by generating more data that we can analyze .
Now here &apos;s one other thing you can do with the computer model .
So imagine a monkey sitting at a keyboard .
I think you might get a random jumble of letters that looks like this .
Such a random jumble of letters is said to have a very high entropy .
This is a physics and information theory term .
But just imagine it &apos;s a really random jumble of letters .
How many of you have ever spilled coffee on a keyboard ?
You might have encountered the stuck-key problem — so basically the same symbol being repeated over and over again .
This kind of a sequence is said to have a very low entropy because there &apos;s no variation at all .
Language , on the other hand , has an intermediate level of entropy ; it &apos;s neither too rigid , nor is it too random .
What about the Indus script ?
Here &apos;s a graph that plots the entropies of a whole bunch of sequences .
At the very top you find the uniformly random sequence , which is a random jumble of letters — and interestingly , we also find the DNA sequence from the human genome and instrumental music .
And both of these are very , very flexible , which is why you find them in the very high range .
At the lower end of the scale , you find a rigid sequence , a sequence of all A &apos;s , and you also find a computer program , in this case in the language Fortran , which obeys really strict rules .
Linguistic scripts occupy the middle range .
Now what about the Indus script ?
We found that the Indus script actually falls within the range of the linguistic scripts .
When this result was first published , it was highly controversial .
There were people who raised a hue and cry , and these people were the ones who believed that the Indus script does not represent language .
I even started to get some hate mail .
My students said that I should really seriously consider getting some protection .
Who &apos;d have thought that deciphering could be a dangerous profession ?
What does this result really show ?
It shows that the Indus script shares an important property of language .
So , as the old saying goes , if it looks like a linguistic script and it acts like a linguistic script , then perhaps we may have a linguistic script on our hands .
What other evidence is there that the script could actually encode language ?
Well linguistic scripts can actually encode multiple languages .
So for example , here &apos;s the same sentence written in English and the same sentence written in Dutch using the same letters of the alphabet .
If you don &apos;t know Dutch and you only know English and I give you some words in Dutch , you &apos;ll tell me that these words contain some very unusual patterns .
Some things are not right , and you &apos;ll say these words are probably not English words .
The same thing happens in the case of the Indus script .
The computer found several texts — two of them are shown here — that have very unusual patterns .
So for example the first text : there &apos;s a doubling of this jar-shaped sign .
This sign is the most frequently-occurring sign in the Indus script , and it &apos;s only in this text that it occurs as a doubling pair .
Why is that the case ?
We went back and looked at where these particular texts were found , and it turns out that they were found very , very far away from the Indus Valley .
They were found in present day Iraq and Iran .
And why were they found there ?
What I haven &apos;t told you is that the Indus people were very , very enterprising .
They used to trade with people pretty far away from where they lived , and so in this case , they were traveling by sea all the way to Mesopotamia , present-day Iraq .
And what seems to have happened here is that the Indus traders , the merchants , were using this script to write a foreign language .
It &apos;s just like our English and Dutch example .
And that would explain why we have these strange patterns that are very different from the kinds of patterns you see in the text that are found within the Indus Valley .
This suggests that the same script , the Indus script , could be used to write different languages .
The results we have so far seem to point to the conclusion that the Indus script probably does represent language .
If it does represent language , then how do we read the symbols ?
That &apos;s our next big challenge .
So you &apos;ll notice that many of the symbols look like pictures of humans , of insects , of fishes , of birds .
Most ancient scripts use the rebus principle , which is , using pictures to represent words .
So as an example , here &apos;s a word .
Can you write it using pictures ?
I &apos;ll give you a couple seconds .
Got it ?
Okay . Great .
Here &apos;s my solution .
You could use the picture of a bee followed by a picture of a leaf — and that &apos;s &quot; &quot; belief , &quot; &quot; right .
There could be other solutions .
In the case of the Indus script , the problem is the reverse .
You have to figure out the sounds of each of these pictures such that the entire sequence makes sense .
So this is just like a crossword puzzle , except that this is the mother of all crossword puzzles because the stakes are so high if you solve it .
My colleagues , Iravatham Mahadevan and Asko Parpola , have been making some headway on this particular problem .
And I &apos;d like to give you a quick example of Parpola &apos;s work .
Here &apos;s a really short text .
It contains seven vertical strokes followed by this fish-like sign .
And I want to mention that these seals were used for stamping clay tags that were attached to bundles of goods , so it &apos;s quite likely that these tags , at least some of them , contain names of merchants .
And it turns out that in India there &apos;s a long tradition of names being based on horoscopes and star constellations present at the time of birth .
In Dravidian languages , the word for fish is &quot; &quot; meen &quot; &quot; which happens to sound just like the word for star .
And so seven stars would stand for &quot; &quot; elu meen , &quot; &quot; which is the Dravidian word for the Big Dipper star constellation .
Similarly , there &apos;s another sequence of six stars , and that translates to &quot; &quot; aru meen , &quot; &quot; which is the old Dravidian name for the star constellation Pleiades .
And finally , there &apos;s other combinations , such as this fish sign with something that looks like a roof on top of it .
And that could be translated into &quot; &quot; mey meen , &quot; &quot; which is the old Dravidian name for the planet Saturn .
So that was pretty exciting .
It looks like we &apos;re getting somewhere .
But does this prove that these seals contain Dravidian names based on planets and star constellations ?
Well not yet .
So we have no way of validating these particular readings , but if more and more of these readings start making sense , and if longer and longer sequences appear to be correct , then we know that we are on the right track .
Today , we can write a word such as TED in Egyptian hieroglyphics and in cuneiform script , because both of these were deciphered in the 19th century .
The decipherment of these two scripts enabled these civilizations to speak to us again directly .
The Mayans started speaking to us in the 20th century , but the Indus civilization remains silent .
Why should we care ?
The Indus civilization does not belong to just the South Indians or the North Indians or the Pakistanis ; it belongs to all of us .
These are our ancestors — yours and mine .
They were silenced by an unfortunate accident of history .
If we decipher the script , we would enable them to speak to us again .
What would they tell us ?
What would we find out about them ? About us ?
I can &apos;t wait to find out .
Thank you .

Hi . I &apos;m Kevin Allocca , I &apos;m the trends manager at YouTube , and I professionally watch YouTube videos .
It &apos;s true .
So we &apos;re going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters .
We all want to be stars — celebrities , singers , comedians — and when I was younger , that seemed so very , very hard to do .
But now Web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world &apos;s culture .
Any one of you could be famous on the Internet by next Saturday .
But there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute .
And of that , only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment .
So how does it happen ?
Three things : tastemakers , communities of participation and unexpectedness .
All right , let &apos;s go .
( Video ) Bear Vasquez : Oh , my God . Oh , my God .
Oh , my God !
Wooo !
Ohhhhh , wowwww !
KA : Last year , Bear Vasquez posted this video that he had shot outside his home in Yosemite National Park .
In 2010 , it was viewed 23 million times .
( Laughter ) This is a chart of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer .
But he didn &apos;t actually set out to make a viral video , Bear .
He just wanted to share a rainbow .
Because that &apos;s what you do when your name is Yosemite Mountain Bear .
( Laughter ) And he had posted lots of nature videos in fact .
And this video had actually been posted all the way back in January .
So what happened here ?
Jimmy Kimmel actually .
Jimmy Kimmel posted this tweet that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become .
Because tastemakers like Jimmy Kimmel introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience .
( Video ) Rebecca Black : ♫ It &apos;s Friday , Friday . Gotta get down on Friday . ♫ ♫ Everybody &apos;s looking forward to the weekend , weekend . ♫ ♫ Friday , Friday . Gettin &apos; down on Friday . ♫ KA : So you didn &apos;t think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video I hope .
Rebecca Black &apos;s &quot; &quot; Friday &quot; &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
It &apos;s been seen nearly 200 million times this year .
This is a chart of what it looked like .
And similar to &quot; &quot; Double Rainbow , &quot; &quot; it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere .
So what happened on this day ?
Well it was a Friday , this is true .
And if you &apos;re wondering about those other spikes , those are also Fridays .
( Laughter ) But what about this day , this one particular Friday ?
Well Tosh.0 picked it up , a lot of blogs starting writing about .
Michael J. Nelson from Mystery Science Theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on Twitter .
But what &apos;s important is that an individual or a group of tastemakers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience , accelerating the process .
And so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it .
And now there are 10,000 parodies of &quot; &quot; Friday &quot; &quot; on YouTube .
Even in the first seven days , there was one parody for every other day of the week .
( Laughter ) Unlike the one-way entertainment of the 20th century , this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon — either by spreading it or by doing something new with it .
( Music ) So &quot; &quot; Nyan Cat &quot; &quot; is a looped animation with looped music .
It &apos;s this , just like this .
It &apos;s been viewed nearly 50 million times this year .
And if you think that that is weird , you should know that there is a three-hour version of this that &apos;s been viewed four million times .
( Laughter ) Even cats were watching this video . ( Laughter )
Cats were watching other cats watch this video . ( Laughter )
But what &apos;s important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this techie , geeky Internet culture .
There were remixes .
( Laughter ) Someone made an old timey version . ( Laughter )
And then it went international . ( Laughter )
An entire remix community sprouted up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of .
Because we don &apos;t just enjoy now , we participate .
And who could have predicted any of this ?
Who could have predicted &quot; &quot; Double Rainbow &quot; &quot; or Rebecca Black or &quot; &quot; Nyan Cat ? &quot; &quot; What scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it ?
In a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute , only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have .
When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video about a guy protesting bicycle fines in New York City , I admit I wasn &apos;t very interested .
( Video ) Casey Niestat : So I got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane , but often there are obstructions that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane .
( Laughter ) KA : By being totally surprising and humorous , Casey Niestat got his funny idea and point seen five million times .
And so this approach holds for anything new that we do creatively .
And so it all brings us to one big question ...
( Video ) Bear Vasquez : What does this mean ?
Ohhhh .
( Laughter ) KA : What does it mean ?
Tastemakers , creative participating communities , complete unexpectedness , these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defines the popularity .
I mean , as mentioned earlier , one of the biggest stars in the world right now , Justin Bieber , got his start on YouTube .
No one has to green-light your idea .
And we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture .
And these are not characteristics of old media , and they &apos;re barely true of the media of today , but they will define the entertainment of the future .
Thank you .
( Applause )
If we look around us , much of what surrounds us started life as various rocks and sludge buried in the ground in various places in the world .
But , of course , they don &apos;t look like rocks and sludge now .
They look like TV cameras , monitors , annoying radio mics .
And so this magical transformation is what I was trying to get at with my project , which became known as the Toaster Project .
And it was also inspired by this quote from Douglas Adams , and the situation is from &quot; &quot; The Hitchhiker &apos;s Guide to the Galaxy . &quot; &quot; And the situation it describes is the hero of the book — he &apos;s a 20th-century man — finds himself alone on a strange planet populated only by a technologically primitive people .
And he kind of assumes that , yes , he &apos;ll become — these villagers — he &apos;ll become their emperor and transform their society with his wonderful command of technology and science and the elements , but , of course , realizes that without the rest of human society , he can barely make a sandwich , let alone a toaster .
But he didn &apos;t have Wikipedia .
So I thought , okay , I &apos;ll try and make an electric toaster from scratch .
And , working on the idea that the cheapest electric toaster would also be the simplest to reverse-engineer , I went and bought the cheapest toaster I could find , took it home and was kind of dismayed to discover that , inside this object , which I &apos;d bought for just 3.49 pounds , there were 400 different bits made out of a hundred-plus different materials .
I didn &apos;t have the rest of my life to do this project .
I had maybe nine months .
So I thought , okay , I &apos;ll start with five .
And these were steel , mica , plastic , copper and nickel .
So , starting with steel : how do you make steel ?
I went and knocked on the door of the Rio Tinto Chair of Advanced Mineral Extraction at the Royal School of Mines and said , &quot; &quot; How do you make steel ? &quot; &quot; And Professor Cilliers was very kind and talked me through it .
And my vague rememberings from GCSE science — well , steel comes from iron , so I phoned up an iron mine .
And said , &quot; &quot; Hi , I &apos;m trying to make a toaster .
Can I come up and get some iron ? &quot; &quot; Unfortunately , when I got there — emerges Ray .
He had misheard me and thought I was coming up because I was trying to make a poster , and so wasn &apos;t prepared to take me into the mines .
But after some nagging , I got him to do that .
( Video ) Ray : It was Crease Limestone , and that was produced by sea creatures 350 million years ago in a nice , warm , sunny atmosphere .
When you study geology , you can see what &apos;s happened in the past , and there were terrific changes in the earth .
Thomas Thwaites : As you can see , they had the Christmas decorations up .
And of course , it wasn &apos;t actually a working mine anymore , because , though Ray was a miner there , the mine had closed and had been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction , because , of course , it can &apos;t compete on the scale of operations which are happening in South America , Australia , wherever .
But anyway , I got my suitcase of iron ore and dragged it back to London on the train , and then was faced with the problem : Okay , how do you make this rock into components for a toaster ?
So I went back to Professor Cilliers , and he said , &quot; &quot; Go to the library . &quot; &quot; So I did and was looking through the undergraduate textbooks on metallurgy — completely useless for what I was trying to do .
Because , of course , they don &apos;t actually tell you how to do it if you want to do it yourself and you don &apos;t have a smelting plant .
So I ended up going to the History of Science Library and looking at this book .
This is the first textbook on metallurgy written in the West , at least .
And there you can see that woodcut is basically what I ended up doing .
But instead of a bellows , I had a leaf blower .
( Laughter ) And that was something that reoccurred throughout the project , was , the smaller the scale you want to work on , the further back in time you have to go .
And so this is after a day and about half a night smelting this iron .
I dragged out this stuff , and it wasn &apos;t iron .
But luckily , I found a patent online for industrial furnaces that use microwaves , and at 30 minutes at full power , and I was able to finish off the process .
So , my next — ( Applause ) The next thing I was trying to get was copper .
Again , this mine was once the largest copper mine in the world .
It &apos;s not anymore , but I found a retired geology professor to take me down , and he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;ll let you have some water from the mine . &quot; &quot; And the reason I was interested in getting water is because water which goes through mines becomes kind of acidic and will start picking up , dissolving the minerals from the mine .
And a good example of this is the Rio Tinto , which is in Portugal .
As you can see , it &apos;s got lots and lots of minerals dissolved in it .
So many such that it &apos;s now just a home for bacteria who really like acidic , toxic conditions .
But anyway , the water I dragged back from the Isle of Anglesey where the mine was — there was enough copper in it such that I could cast the pins of my metal electric plug .
So my next thing : I was off to Scotland to get mica .
And mica is a mineral which is a very good insulator and very good at insulating electricity .
That &apos;s me getting mica .
And the last material I &apos;m going to talk about today is plastic , and , of course , my toaster had to have a plastic case .
Plastic is the defining feature of cheap electrical goods .
And so plastic comes from oil , so I phoned up BP and spent a good half an hour trying to convince the PR office at BP that it would be fantastic for them if they flew me to an oil rig and let me have a jug of oil .
BP obviously has a bit more on their mind now .
But even then they weren &apos;t convinced and said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we &apos;ll phone you back &quot; &quot; — never did .
So I looked at other ways of making plastic .
And you can actually make plastic from obviously oils which come from plants , but also from starches .
So this is attempting to make potato starch plastic .
And for a while that was looking really good .
I poured it into the mold , which you can see there , which I &apos;ve made from a tree trunk .
And it was looking good for a while , but I left it outside , because you had to leave it outside to dry , and unfortunately I came back and there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato .
So kind of out of desperation , I decided that I could think laterally .
And geologists have actually christened — well , they &apos;re debating whether to christen — the age that we &apos;re living in — they &apos;re debating whether to make it a new geological epoch called the Anthropocene , the age of Man .
And that &apos;s because geologists of the future would kind of see a sharp shift in the strata of rock that is being laid down now .
So suddenly , it will become kind of radioactive from Chernobyl and the 2,000 or so nuclear bombs that have been set off since 1945 .
And there &apos;d also be an extinction event — like fossils would suddenly disappear .
And also , I thought that there would be synthetic polymers , plastics , embedded in the rock .
So I looked up a plastic — so I decided that I could mine some of this modern-day rock .
And I went up to Manchester to visit a place called Axion Recycling .
And they &apos;re at the sharp end of what &apos;s called the WEEE , which is this European electrical and electronic waste directive .
And that was brought into force to try and deal with the mountain of stuff that is just being made and then living for a while in our homes and then going to landfill .
But this is it .
( Music ) ( Laughter ) So there &apos;s a picture of my toaster .
( Applause ) That &apos;s it without the case on .
And there it is on the shelves .
Thanks .
( Applause ) Bruno Giussani : I &apos;m told you did plug it in once .
TT : Yeah , I did plug it in .
I don &apos;t know if you could see , but I was never able to make insulation for the wires .
Kew Gardens were insistent that I couldn &apos;t come and hack into their rubber tree .
So the wires were uninsulated .
So there was 240 volts going through these homemade copper wires , homemade plug .
And for about five seconds , the toaster toasted , but then , unfortunately , the element kind of melted itself .
But I considered it a partial success , to be honest .
BG : Thomas Thwaites . TT : Thanks .
So whenever I visit a school and talk to students , I always ask them the same thing : Why do you Google ?
Why is Google the search engine of choice for you ?
Strangely enough , I always get the same three answers .
One , &quot; &quot; Because it works , &quot; &quot; which is a great answer ; that &apos;s why I Google , too .
Two , somebody will say , &quot; I really don &apos;t know of any alternatives . &quot;
Certain to always get the best , unbiased search result .
Now , as a man of the humanities , albeit a digital humanities man , that just makes my skin curl , even if I , too , realize that that trust , that idea of the unbiased search result is a cornerstone in our collective love for and appreciation of Google .
I will show you why that , philosophically , is almost an impossibility .
But let me first elaborate , just a little bit , on a basic principle behind each search query that we sometimes seem to forget .
So whenever you set out to Google something , start by asking yourself this : &quot; &quot; Am I looking for an isolated fact ? &quot; &quot; What is the capital of France ?
What are the building blocks of a water molecule ?
Great — Google away .
But if you complicate your question just a little bit and ask something like , &quot; Why is there an Israeli-Palestine conflict ? &quot;
You &apos;re not exactly looking for a singular fact anymore , you &apos;re looking for knowledge , which is something way more complicated and delicate .
This is when we start to argue , to form society .
So , I promised you an example just to show you why it &apos;s so hard to get to the point of true , clean , objective knowledge — as food for thought .
I will conduct a couple of simple queries , search queries .
We &apos;ll start with &quot; &quot; Michelle Obama , &quot; &quot; the First Lady of the United States .
And we &apos;ll click for pictures .
It works really well , as you can see .
It &apos;s a perfect search result , more or less .
It &apos;s just her in the picture , not even the President .
How does this work ?
Quite simple .
Google uses a lot of smartness to achieve this , but quite simply , they look at two things more than anything .
First , what does it say in the caption under the picture on each website ?
Does it say &quot; &quot; Michelle Obama &quot; &quot; under the picture ?
Pretty good indication it &apos;s actually her on there .
Second , Google looks at the picture file , the name of the file as such uploaded to the website .
Again , is it called &quot; &quot; MichelleObama.jpeg &quot; &quot; ?
Pretty good indication it &apos;s not Clint Eastwood in the picture .
So , you &apos;ve got those two and you get a search result like this — almost .
Now , in 2009 , Michelle Obama was the victim of a racist campaign , where people set out to insult her through her search results .
And that picture was published all over .
And people published it very , very purposefully , to get it up there in the search results .
They made sure to write &quot; &quot; Michelle Obama &quot; &quot; in the caption and they made sure to upload the picture as &quot; &quot; MichelleObama.jpeg , &quot; &quot; or the like .
You get why — to manipulate the search result .
And it worked , too .
So when you picture-Googled for &quot; &quot; Michelle Obama &quot; &quot; in 2009 , that distorted monkey picture showed up among the first results .
However , Google didn &apos;t settle for that this time , they just thought , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s racist and it &apos;s a bad search result and we &apos;re going to go back and clean that up manually .
We are going to write some code and fix it , &quot; &quot; which they did .
And I don &apos;t think anyone in this room thinks that was a bad idea .
Me neither .
But then , a couple of years go by , and the world &apos;s most-Googled Anders , Anders Behring Breivik , did what he did .
This is July 22 in 2011 , and a terrible day in Norwegian history .
This man , a terrorist , blew up a couple of government buildings walking distance from where we are right now in Oslo , Norway and then he traveled to the island of Utøya and shot and killed a group of kids .
Almost 80 people died that day .
And a lot of people would describe this act of terror as two steps , that he did two things : he blew up the buildings and he shot those kids .
It &apos;s not true .
It was three steps .
He blew up those buildings , he shot those kids , and he sat down and waited for the world to Google him .
And he prepared all three steps equally well .
And if there was somebody who immediately understood this , it was a Swedish web developer , a search engine optimization expert in Stockholm , named Nikke Lindqvist .
Let &apos;s see if we can distort that .
Let &apos;s see if we , in the civilized world , can protest against what he did through insulting him in his search results . &quot; &quot; And how ?
He told all of his readers the following , &quot; &quot; Go out there on the Internet , find pictures of dog poop on sidewalks — find pictures of dog poop on sidewalks — publish them in your feeds , on your websites , on your blogs .
Make sure to write the terrorist &apos;s name in the caption , make sure to name the picture file &quot; &quot; Breivik.jpeg. &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s teach Google that that &apos;s the face of the terrorist . &quot; &quot; And it worked .
If you picture-Googled for him weeks after the July 22 events from Sweden , you &apos;d see that picture of dog poop high up in the search results , as a little protest .
Strangely enough , Google didn &apos;t intervene this time .
They did not step in and manually clean those search results up .
So the million-dollar question , is there anything different between these two happenings here ?
Is there anything different between what happened to Michelle Obama and what happened to Anders Behring Breivik ?
Of course not .
It &apos;s the exact same thing , yet Google intervened in one case and not in the other .
Why ?
Because Michelle Obama is an honorable person , that &apos;s why , and Anders Behring Breivik is a despicable person .
See what happens there ?
An evaluation of a person takes place and there &apos;s only one power-player in the world with the authority to say who &apos;s who .
&quot; &quot; We like you , we dislike you .
We believe in you , we don &apos;t believe in you .
You &apos;re Obama , and you &apos;re Breivik . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s power if I ever saw it .
So I &apos;m asking you to remember that behind every algorithm is always a person , a person with a set of personal beliefs that no code can ever completely eradicate .
And my message goes out not only to Google , but to all believers in the faith of code around the world .
You need to identify your own personal bias .
You need to understand that you are human and take responsibility accordingly .
Tighter than ever .
And , if nothing else , to remind us that that wonderfully seductive idea of the unbiased , clean search result is , and is likely to remain , a myth .
Thank you for your time .
( Applause )
( Laughter ) So then I bring this back into the game .
I collaborate with bacteria .
And I &apos;m about to show you some stop-motion footage that I made recently where you &apos;ll see bacteria accumulating minerals from their environment over the period of an hour .
So what you &apos;re seeing here is the bacteria metabolizing , and as they do so they create an electrical charge .
And this attracts metals from their local environment .
And these metals accumulate as minerals on the surface of the bacteria .
One of the most pervasive problems in the world today for people is inadequate access to clean drinking water .
And the desalination process is one where we take out salts .
We can use it for drinking and agriculture .
Removing the salts from water — particularly seawater — through reverse osmosis is a critical technique for countries who do not have access to clean drinking water around the globe .
So seawater reverse osmosis is a membrane-filtration technology .
We take the water from the sea and we apply pressure .
And this pressure forces the seawater through a membrane .
This takes energy , producing clean water .
But we &apos;re also left with a concentrated salt solution , or brine .
But the process is very expensive and it &apos;s cost-prohibitive for many countries around the globe .
And also , the brine that &apos;s produced is oftentimes just pumped back out into the sea .
And this is detrimental to the local ecology of the sea area that it &apos;s pumped back out into .
So I work in Singapore at the moment , and this is a place that &apos;s really a leading place for desalination technology .
And Singapore proposes by 2060 to produce &#91; 900 &#93; million liters per day of desalinated water .
But this will produce an equally massive amount of desalination brine .
And this is where my collaboration with bacteria comes into play .
So what we &apos;re doing at the moment is we &apos;re accumulating metals like calcium , potassium and magnesium from out of desalination brine .
And this , in terms of magnesium and the amount of water that I just mentioned , equates to a $ 4.5 billion mining industry for Singapore — a place that doesn &apos;t have any natural resources .
So I &apos;d like you to image a mining industry in a way that one hasn &apos;t existed before ; imagine a mining industry that doesn &apos;t mean defiling the Earth ; imagine bacteria helping us do this by accumulating and precipitating and sedimenting minerals out of desalination brine .
And what you can see here is the beginning of an industry in a test tube , a mining industry that is in harmony with nature .
Thank you .

I &apos;m five years old , and I am very proud .
My father has just built the best outhouse in our little village in Ukraine .
Inside , it &apos;s a smelly , gaping hole in the ground , but outside , it &apos;s pearly white formica and it literally gleams in the sun .
This makes me feel so proud , so important , that I appoint myself the leader of my little group of friends and I devise missions for us .
So we prowl from house to house looking for flies captured in spider webs and we set them free .
Four years earlier , when I was one , after the Chernobyl accident , the rain came down black , and my sister &apos;s hair fell out in clumps , and I spent nine months in the hospital .
There were no visitors allowed , so my mother bribed a hospital worker .
She acquired a nurse &apos;s uniform , and she snuck in every night to sit by my side .
Five years later , an unexpected silver lining .
Thanks to Chernobyl , we get asylum in the U.S.
I am six years old , and I don &apos;t cry when we leave home and we come to America , because I expect it to be a place filled with rare and wonderful things like bananas and chocolate and Bazooka bubble gum , Bazooka bubble gum with the little cartoon wrappers inside , Bazooka that we &apos;d get once a year in Ukraine and we &apos;d have to chew one piece for an entire week .
So the first day we get to New York , my grandmother and I find a penny in the floor of the homeless shelter that my family &apos;s staying in .
Only , we don &apos;t know that it &apos;s a homeless shelter .
We think that it &apos;s a hotel , a hotel with lots of rats .
So we find this penny kind of fossilized in the floor , and we think that a very wealthy man must have left it there because regular people don &apos;t just lose money .
And I hold this penny in the palm of my hand , and it &apos;s sticky and rusty , but it feels like I &apos;m holding a fortune .
And in that moment , I feel like a millionaire .
So we take the pizza , our very first pizza , and we devour slice after slice as the deliveryman stands there and stares at us from the doorway .
And he tells us to pay , but we don &apos;t speak English .
My mother comes out , and he asks her for money , but she doesn &apos;t have enough .
Then our neighbor pops her head in , and she turns red with rage when she realizes that those immigrants from downstairs have somehow gotten their hands on her pizza .
Everyone &apos;s upset .
But the pizza is delicious .
It doesn &apos;t hit me until years later just how little we had .
On our 10 year anniversary of being in the U.S. , we decided to celebrate by reserving a room at the hotel that we first stayed in when we got to the U.S.
My husband Brian was also homeless as a kid .
His family lost everything , and at age 11 , he had to live in motels with his dad , motels that would round up all of their food and keep it hostage until they were able to pay the bill .
And one time , when he finally got his box of Frosted Flakes back , it was crawling with roaches .
But he did have one thing .
This was his own assembly of heroes that kept him from drugs and gangs and from giving up on his dreams .
I &apos;m going to tell you about one more formerly homeless member of our family .
Once upon a time , Scarlet was used as bait in dog fights .
She was tied up and thrown into the ring for other dogs to attack so they &apos;d get more aggressive before the fight .
Sometimes Brian and I walk through the park with Scarlett , and she rolls through the grass , and we just look at her and then we look at each other and we feel gratitude .
We forget about all of our new middle-class frustrations and disappointments , and we feel like millionaires .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Blah blah blah blah blah .
Blah blah blah blah , blah blah , blah blah blah blah blah blah .
Blah blah blah , blah .
So what the hell was that ?
Well , you don &apos;t know because you couldn &apos;t understand it .
It wasn &apos;t clear .
But hopefully , it was said with enough conviction that it was at least alluringly mysterious .
Clarity or mystery ?
I &apos;m balancing these two things in my daily work as a graphic designer , as well as my daily life as a New Yorker every day , and there are two elements that absolutely fascinate me .
Here &apos;s an example .
Now , how many people know what this is ?
Okay . Now how many people know what this is ?
Okay . Thanks to two more deft strokes by the genius Charles M. Schulz , we now have seven deft strokes that in and of themselves create an entire emotional life , one that has enthralled hundreds of millions of fans for over 50 years .
This is actually a cover of a book that I designed about the work of Schulz and his art , which will be coming out this fall , and that is the entire cover .
There is no other typographic information or visual information on the front , and the name of the book is &quot; &quot; Only What &apos;s Necessary . &quot; &quot; So this is sort of symbolic about the decisions I have to make every day about the design that I &apos;m perceiving , and the design I &apos;m creating .
So clarity .
Clarity gets to the point .
It &apos;s blunt . It &apos;s honest . It &apos;s sincere .
We ask ourselves this . &#91; &quot; &quot; When should you be clear ? &quot; &quot; &#93; Now , something like this , whether we can read it or not , needs to be really , really clear .
Is it ?
This is a rather recent example of urban clarity that I just love , mainly because I &apos;m always late and I am always in a hurry .
So when these meters started showing up a couple of years ago on street corners , I was thrilled , because now I finally knew how many seconds I had to get across the street before I got run over by a car .
Six ? I can do that . ( Laughter ) So let &apos;s look at the yin to the clarity yang , and that is mystery .
Mystery is a lot more complicated by its very definition .
Mystery demands to be decoded , and when it &apos;s done right , we really , really want to .
&#91; &quot; &quot; When should you be mysterious ? &quot; &quot; &#93; In World War II , the Germans really , really wanted to decode this , and they couldn &apos;t .
Here &apos;s an example of a design that I &apos;ve done recently for a novel by Haruki Murakami , who I &apos;ve done design work for for over 20 years now , and this is a novel about a young man who has four dear friends who all of a sudden , after their freshman year of college , completely cut him off with no explanation , and he is devastated .
And the friends &apos; names each have a connotation in Japanese to a color .
So there &apos;s Mr. Red , there &apos;s Mr. Blue , there &apos;s Ms. White , and Ms. Black .
Tsukuru Tazaki , his name does not correspond to a color , so his nickname is Colorless , and as he &apos;s looking back on their friendship , he recalls that they were like five fingers on a hand .
So I created this sort of abstract representation of this , but there &apos;s a lot more going on underneath the surface of the story , and there &apos;s more going on underneath the surface of the jacket .
The four fingers are now four train lines in the Tokyo subway system , which has significance within the story .
And then you have the colorless subway line intersecting with each of the other colors , which basically he does later on in the story .
He catches up with each of these people to find out why they treated him the way they did .
And so this is the three-dimensional finished product sitting on my desk in my office , and what I was hoping for here is that you &apos;ll simply be allured by the mystery of what this looks like , and will want to read it to decode and find out and make more clear why it looks the way it does .
&#91; &quot; &quot; The Visual Vernacular . &quot; &quot; &#93; This is a way to use a more familiar kind of mystery .
What does this mean ?
This is what it means . &#91; &quot; &quot; Make it look like something else . &quot; &quot; &#93; The visual vernacular is the way we are used to seeing a certain thing applied to something else so that we see it in a different way .
This is an approach I wanted to take to a book of essays by David Sedaris that had this title at the time . &#91; &quot; &quot; All the Beauty You Will Ever Need &quot; &quot; &#93; Now , the challenge here was that this title actually means nothing .
It &apos;s not connected to any of the essays in the book .
It came to the author &apos;s boyfriend in a dream .
Thank you very much , so — ( Laughter ) — so usually , I am creating a design that is in some way based on the text , but this is all the text there is .
So you &apos;ve got this mysterious title that really doesn &apos;t mean anything , so I was trying to think : Where might I see a bit of mysterious text that seems to mean something but doesn &apos;t ?
And sure enough , not long after , one evening after a Chinese meal , this arrived , and I thought , &quot; &quot; Ah , bing , ideagasm ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;ve always loved the hilariously mysterious tropes of fortune cookies that seem to mean something extremely deep but when you think about them — if you think about them — they really don &apos;t .
This says , &quot; &quot; Hardly anyone knows how much is gained by ignoring the future . &quot; &quot; Thank you . ( Laughter ) But we can take this visual vernacular and apply it to Mr. Sedaris , and we are so familiar with how fortune cookie fortunes look that we don &apos;t even need the bits of the cookie anymore .
We &apos;re just seeing this strange thing and we know we love David Sedaris , and so we &apos;re hoping that we &apos;re in for a good time .
&#91; &quot; &quot; &apos; Fraud &apos; Essays by David Rakoff &quot; &quot; &#93; David Rakoff was a wonderful writer and he called his first book &quot; &quot; Fraud &quot; &quot; because he was getting sent on assignments by magazines to do things that he was not equipped to do .
So he was this skinny little urban guy and GQ magazine would send him down the Colorado River whitewater rafting to see if he would survive .
And then he would write about it , and he felt that he was a fraud and that he was misrepresenting himself .
And so I wanted the cover of this book to also misrepresent itself and then somehow show a reader reacting to it .
This led me to graffiti .
I &apos;m fascinated by graffiti .
I think anybody who lives in an urban environment encounters graffiti all the time , and there &apos;s all different sorts of it .
This is a picture I took on the Lower East Side of just a transformer box on the sidewalk and it &apos;s been tagged like crazy .
Now whether you look at this and think , &quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s a charming urban affectation , &quot; &quot; or you look at it and say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s illegal abuse of property , &quot; &quot; the one thing I think we can all agree on is that you cannot read it .
Right ? There is no clear message here .
There is another kind of graffiti that I find far more interesting , which I call editorial graffiti .
This is a picture I took recently in the subway , and sometimes you see lots of prurient , stupid stuff , but I thought this was interesting , and this is a poster that is saying rah-rah Airbnb , and someone has taken a Magic Marker and has editorialized about what they think about it .
And it got my attention .
So I was thinking , how do we apply this to this book ?
So I get the book by this person , and I start reading it , and I &apos;m thinking , this guy is not who he says he is ; he &apos;s a fraud .
And I get out a red Magic Marker , and out of frustration just scribble this across the front .
Design done . ( Laughter ) And they went for it ! ( Laughter ) Author liked it , publisher liked it , and that is how the book went out into the world , and it was really fun to see people reading this on the subway and walking around with it and what have you , and they all sort of looked like they were crazy . ( Laughter )
&#91; &quot; &quot; &apos; Perfidia &apos; a novel by James Ellroy &quot; &quot; &#93; Okay , James Ellroy , amazing crime writer , a good friend , I &apos;ve worked with him for many years .
He is probably best known as the author of &quot; &quot; The Black Dahlia &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; L.A. Confidential . &quot; &quot; His most recent novel was called this , which is a very mysterious name that I &apos;m sure a lot of people know what it means , but a lot of people don &apos;t .
And it &apos;s a story about a Japanese-American detective in Los Angeles in 1941 investigating a murder .
And then Pearl Harbor happens , and as if his life wasn &apos;t difficult enough , now the race relations have really ratcheted up , and then the Japanese-American internment camps are quickly created , and there &apos;s lots of tension and horrible stuff as he &apos;s still trying to solve this murder .
And so I did at first think very literally about this in terms of all right , we &apos;ll take Pearl Harbor and we &apos;ll add it to Los Angeles and we &apos;ll make this apocalyptic dawn on the horizon of the city .
And so that &apos;s a picture from Pearl Harbor just grafted onto Los Angeles .
My editor in chief said , &quot; &quot; You know , it &apos;s interesting but I think you can do better and I think you can make it simpler . &quot; &quot; And so I went back to the drawing board , as I often do .
But also , being alive to my surroundings , I work in a high-rise in Midtown , and every night , before I leave the office , I have to push this button to get out , and the big heavy glass doors open and I can get onto the elevator .
And one night , all of a sudden , I looked at this and I saw it in a way that I hadn &apos;t really noticed it before .
Big red circle , danger .
And I thought this was so obvious that it had to have been done a zillion times , and so I did a Google image search , and I couldn &apos;t find another book cover that looked quite like this , and so this is really what solved the problem , and graphically it &apos;s more interesting and creates a bigger tension between the idea of a certain kind of sunrise coming up over L.A. and America .
&#91; &quot; &quot; &apos; Gulp &apos; A tour of the human digestive system by Mary Roach . &quot; &quot; &#93; Mary Roach is an amazing writer who takes potentially mundane scientific subjects and makes them not mundane at all ; she makes them really fun .
So in this particular case , it &apos;s about the human digestive system .
So I &apos;m trying to figure out what is the cover of this book going to be .
This is a self-portrait . ( Laughter ) Every morning I look at myself in the medicine cabinet mirror to see if my tongue is black .
And if it &apos;s not , I &apos;m good to go .
( Laughter ) I recommend you all do this .
But I also started thinking , here &apos;s our introduction .
Right ? Into the human digestive system .
But I think what we can all agree on is that actual photographs of human mouths , at least based on this , are off-putting . ( Laughter ) So for the cover , then , I had this illustration done which is literally more palatable and reminds us that it &apos;s best to approach the digestive system from this end . ( Laughter )
I don &apos;t even have to complete the sentence . All right .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Unuseful mystery &quot; &quot; &#93; What happens when clarity and mystery get mixed up ?
And we see this all the time .
This is what I call unuseful mystery .
I go down into the subway — I take the subway a lot — and this piece of paper is taped to a girder .
Right ? And now I &apos;m thinking , uh-oh , and the train &apos;s about to come and I &apos;m trying to figure out what this means , and thanks a lot .
Part of the problem here is that they &apos;ve compartmentalized the information in a way they think is helpful , and frankly , I don &apos;t think it is at all .
So this is mystery we do not need .
What we need is useful clarity , so just for fun , I redesigned this .
This is using all the same elements .
( Applause ) Thank you . I am still waiting for a call from the MTA . ( Laughter ) You know , I &apos;m actually not even using more colors than they use .
They just didn &apos;t even bother to make the 4 and the 5 green , those idiots . ( Laughter ) So the first thing we see is that there is a service change , and then , in two complete sentences with a beginning , a middle and an end , it tells us what the change is and what &apos;s going to be happening .
Call me crazy ! ( Laughter ) &#91; &quot; &quot; Useful mystery &quot; &quot; &#93; All right .
Now , here is a piece of mystery that I love : packaging .
This redesign of the Diet Coke can by Turner Duckworth is to me truly a piece of art .
It &apos;s a work of art . It &apos;s beautiful .
But part of what makes it so heartening to me as a designer is that he &apos;s taken the visual vernacular of Diet Coke — the typefaces , the colors , the silver background — and he &apos;s reduced them to their most essential parts , so it &apos;s like going back to the Charlie Brown face .
It &apos;s like , how can you give them just enough information so they know what it is but giving them the credit for the knowledge that they already have about this thing ?
It looks great , and you would go into a delicatessen and all of a sudden see that on the shelf , and it &apos;s wonderful .
Which makes the next thing — &#91; &quot; &quot; Unuseful clarity &quot; &quot; &#93; — all the more disheartening , at least to me .
So okay , again , going back down into the subway , after this came out , these are pictures that I took .
Times Square subway station : Coca-Cola has bought out the entire thing for advertising . Okay ?
And maybe some of you know where this is going .
Ahem .
&quot; &quot; You moved to New York with the clothes on your back , the cash in your pocket , and your eyes on the prize .
You &apos;re on Coke . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; You moved to New York with an MBA , one clean suit , and an extremely firm handshake . You &apos;re on Coke . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
These are real ! ( Laughter ) Not even the support beams were spared , except they switched into Yoda mode . ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Coke you &apos;re on . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &#91; &quot; &quot; Excuse me , I &apos;m on WHAT ? ? &quot; &quot; &#93; This campaign was a huge misstep .
It was pulled almost instantly due to consumer backlash and all sorts of unflattering parodies on the web — ( Laughter ) — and also that dot next to &quot; &quot; You &apos;re on , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s not a period , that &apos;s a trademark .
So thanks a lot .
So to me , this was just so bizarre about how they could get the packaging so mysteriously beautiful and perfect and the message so unbearably , clearly wrong .
It was just incredible to me .
So I just hope that I &apos;ve been able to share with you some of my insights on the uses of clarity and mystery in my work , and maybe how you might decide to be more clear in your life , or maybe to be a bit more mysterious and not so over-sharing .
( Laughter ) And if there &apos;s just one thing that I leave you with from this talk , I hope it &apos;s this : Blih blih blih blah . Blah blah blih blih . &#91; &quot; &quot; &apos; Judge This , &apos; Chip Kidd &quot; &quot; &#93; Blih blih blah blah blah . Blah blah blah .
Blah blah .
( Applause )
So I &apos;m going to speak about a problem that I have and that &apos;s that I &apos;m a philosopher .
( Laughter ) When I go to a party and people ask me what do I do and I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a professor , &quot; &quot; their eyes glaze over .
( Laughter ) When I go to a philosopher &apos;s party ( Laughter ) and they ask me what I work on and I say , &quot; &quot; consciousness , &quot; &quot; their eyes don &apos;t glaze over — their lips curl into a snarl . ( Laughter )
And I get hoots of derision and cackles and growls because they think , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s impossible ! You can &apos;t explain consciousness . &quot; &quot; The very chutzpah of somebody thinking that you could explain consciousness is just out of the question .
My late , lamented friend Bob Nozick , a fine philosopher , in one of his books , &quot; &quot; Philosophical Explanations , &quot; &quot; is commenting on the ethos of philosophy — the way philosophers go about their business .
And he says , you know , &quot; &quot; Philosophers love rational argument . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; It seems as if the ideal argument for most philosophers is you give your audience the premises and then you give them the inferences and the conclusion , and if they don &apos;t accept the conclusion , they die .
Their heads explode . &quot; &quot; The idea is to have an argument that is so powerful that it knocks out your opponents .
But in fact that doesn &apos;t change people &apos;s minds at all .
The reason for that is that everybody &apos;s an expert on consciousness .
We heard the other day that everybody &apos;s got a strong opinion about video games .
They all have an idea for a video game , even if they &apos;re not experts .
But they probably don &apos;t think of these opinions as expertise .
They &apos;re just strongly held opinions .
But with regard to consciousness , people seem to think , each of us seems to think , &quot; &quot; I am an expert .
Simply by being conscious , I know all about this . &quot; &quot; And so , you tell them your theory and they say , &quot; &quot; No , no , that &apos;s not the way consciousness is !
And so what I &apos;m going to try to do today is to shake your confidence . Because I know the feeling — I can feel it myself .
I want to shake your confidence that you know your own innermost minds — that you are , yourselves , authoritative about your own consciousness .
That &apos;s the order of the day here .
Now , this nice picture shows a thought-balloon , a thought-bubble .
I think everybody understands what that means .
That &apos;s supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness .
This is my favorite picture of consciousness that &apos;s ever been done .
It &apos;s a Saul Steinberg of course — it was a New Yorker cover .
And this fellow here is looking at the painting by Braque .
That reminds him of the word baroque , barrack , bark , poodle , Suzanne R. — he &apos;s off to the races .
There &apos;s a wonderful stream of consciousness here and if you follow it along , you learn a lot about this man .
What I particularly like about this picture , too , is that Steinberg has rendered the guy in this sort of pointillist style .
Which reminds us , as Rod Brooks was saying yesterday : what we are , what each of us is — what you are , what I am — is approximately 100 trillion little cellular robots .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re made of .
No other ingredients at all . We &apos;re just made of cells , about 100 trillion of them .
Not a single one of those cells is conscious ; not a single one of those cells knows who you are , or cares .
Somehow , we have to explain how when you put together teams , armies , battalions of hundreds of millions of little robotic unconscious cells — not so different really from a bacterium , each one of them — the result is this . I mean , just look at it .
The content — there &apos;s color , there &apos;s ideas , there &apos;s memories , there &apos;s history . And somehow all that content of consciousness is accomplished by the busy activity of those hoards of neurons .
How is that possible ? Many people just think it isn &apos;t possible at all .
They think , &quot; &quot; No , there can &apos;t be any sort of naturalistic explanation of consciousness . &quot; &quot; This is a lovely book by a friend of mine named Lee Siegel , who &apos;s a professor of religion , actually , at the University of Hawaii , and he &apos;s an expert magician , and an expert on the street magic of India , which is what this book is about , &quot; Net of Magic . &quot;
And there &apos;s a passage in it which I would love to share with you .
It speaks so eloquently to the problem .
&quot; &quot; &apos; I &apos;m writing a book on magic , &apos; I explain , and I &apos;m asked , &apos; Real magic ? &apos; By &apos; real magic , &apos; people mean miracles , thaumaturgical acts , and supernatural powers .
&apos;No , &apos; I answer . &apos; Conjuring tricks , not real magic . &apos; &apos; Real magic , &apos; in other words , refers to the magic that is not real ; while the magic that is real , that can actually be done , is not real magic . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , that &apos;s the way a lot of people feel about consciousness . ( Laughter )
Real consciousness is not a bag of tricks .
If you &apos;re going to explain this as a bag of tricks , then it &apos;s not real consciousness , whatever it is .
And , as Marvin said , and as other people have said , &quot; Consciousness is a bag of tricks . &quot;
This means that a lot of people are just left completely dissatisfied and incredulous when I attempt to explain consciousness .
So this is the problem . So I have to do a little bit of the sort of work that a lot of you won &apos;t like , for the same reason that you don &apos;t like to see a magic trick explained to you .
How many of you here , if somebody — some smart aleck — starts telling you how a particular magic trick is done , you sort of want to block your ears and say , &quot; &quot; No , no , I don &apos;t want to know !
Don &apos;t take the thrill of it away . I &apos;d rather be mystified .
Don &apos;t tell me the answer . &quot; &quot; A lot of people feel that way about consciousness , I &apos;ve discovered .
And I &apos;m sorry if I impose some clarity , some understanding on you .
You &apos;d better leave now if you don &apos;t want to know some of these tricks .
But I &apos;m not going to explain it all to you .
I &apos;m going to do what philosophers do .
Here &apos;s how a philosopher explains the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick .
The philosopher says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to explain to you how that &apos;s done .
You see , the magician doesn &apos;t really saw the lady in half . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; He merely makes you think that he does . &quot;
This is something , by the way , that Lee Siegel talks about in his book .
He marvels at how he &apos;ll do a magic show , and afterwards people will swear they saw him do X , Y , and Z. He never did those things .
He didn &apos;t even try to do those things .
People &apos;s memories inflate what they think they saw .
And the same is true of consciousness .
Now , let &apos;s see if this will work . All right . Let &apos;s just watch this .
Watch it carefully .
I &apos;m working with a young computer-animator documentarian named Nick Deamer , and this is a little demo that he &apos;s done for me , part of a larger project some of you may be interested in .
We &apos;re looking for a backer .
It &apos;s a feature-length documentary on consciousness .
OK , now , you all saw what changed , right ?
How many of you noticed that every one of those squares changed color ?
Every one . I &apos;ll just show you by running it again .
Even when you know that they &apos;re all going to change color , it &apos;s very hard to notice . You have to really concentrate to pick up any of the changes at all .
Now , this is an example — one of many — of a phenomenon that &apos;s now being studied quite a bit .
If there &apos;s time at the end , I &apos;ll show you the much more dramatic case .
Now , how can it be that there are all those changes going on , and that we &apos;re not aware of them ?
Well , earlier today , Jeff Hawkins mentioned the way your eye saccades , the way your eye moves around three or four times a second .
He didn &apos;t mention the speed . Your eye is constantly in motion , moving around , looking at eyes , noses , elbows , looking at interesting things in the world .
And where your eye isn &apos;t looking , you &apos;re remarkably impoverished in your vision .
That &apos;s because the foveal part of your eye , which is the high-resolution part , is only about the size of your thumbnail held at arms length .
That &apos;s the detail part .
It doesn &apos;t seem that way , does it ?
It doesn &apos;t seem that way , but that &apos;s the way it is .
You &apos;re getting in a lot less information than you think .
Here &apos;s a completely different effect . This is a painting by Bellotto .
It &apos;s in the museum in North Carolina .
Bellotto was a student of Canaletto &apos;s .
And I love Canalettos , because Canaletto has this fantastic detail , and you can get right up and see all the details on the painting .
And I started across the hall in North Carolina , because I thought it was probably a Canaletto , and would have all that in detail .
And I noticed that on the bridge there , there &apos;s a lot of people — you can just barely see them walking across the bridge .
And as I got closer and closer , I actually screamed .
I yelled out because when I got closer , I found the detail wasn &apos;t there at all .
There were just little artfully placed blobs of paint .
And as I walked towards the picture , I was expecting detail that wasn &apos;t there .
The artist had very cleverly suggested people and clothes and wagons and all sorts of things , and my brain had taken the suggestion .
You &apos;re familiar with a more recent technology , which is — There , you can get a better view of the blobs .
See , when you get close they &apos;re really just blobs of paint .
You will have seen something like this — this is the reverse effect .
I &apos;ll just give that to you one more time .
Now , what does your brain do when it takes the suggestion ?
When an artful blob of paint or two , by an artist , suggests a person — say , one of Marvin Minsky &apos;s little society of mind — do they send little painters out to fill in all the details in your brain somewhere ?
I don &apos;t think so . Not a chance . But then , how on Earth is it done ?
Well , remember the philosopher &apos;s explanation of the lady ?
It &apos;s the same thing .
The brain just makes you think that it &apos;s got the detail there .
You think the detail &apos;s there , but it isn &apos;t there .
The brain isn &apos;t actually putting the detail in your head at all .
It &apos;s just making you expect the detail .
Let &apos;s just do this experiment very quickly .
Is the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right , rotated ?
Yes .
How many of you did it by rotating the one on the left in your mind &apos;s eye , to see if it matched up with the one on the right ?
How many of you rotated the one on the right ? OK .
How do you know that &apos;s what you did ?
Yes , it &apos;s possible to do that .
But the details of the process are still in significant controversy .
And if you read that literature , one of the things that you really have to come to terms with is even when you &apos;re the subject in the experiment , you don &apos;t know .
You don &apos;t know how you do it .
You just know that you have certain beliefs .
And they come in a certain order , at a certain time .
And what explains the fact that that &apos;s what you think ?
Well , that &apos;s where you have to go backstage and ask the magician .
This is a figure that I love : Bradley , Petrie , and Dumais .
You may think that I &apos;ve cheated , that I &apos;ve put a little whiter-than-white boundary there .
How many of you see that sort of boundary , with the Necker cube floating in front of the circles ?
Can you see it ?
Well , you know , in effect , the boundary &apos;s really there , in a certain sense .
Your brain is actually computing that boundary , the boundary that goes right there .
But now , notice there are two ways of seeing the cube , right ?
It &apos;s a Necker cube .
Everybody can see the two ways of seeing the cube ? OK .
Can you see the four ways of seeing the cube ?
Because there &apos;s another way of seeing it .
If you &apos;re seeing it as a cube floating in front of some circles , some black circles , there &apos;s another way of seeing it .
As a cube , on a black background , as seen through a piece of Swiss cheese .
( Laughter ) Can you get it ? How many of you can &apos;t get it ? That &apos;ll help . ( Laughter )
Now you can get it . These are two very different phenomena .
When you see the cube one way , behind the screen , those boundaries go away .
But there &apos;s still a sort of filling in , as we can tell if we look at this .
We don &apos;t have any trouble seeing the cube , but where does the color change ?
Does your brain have to send little painters in there ?
The purple-painters and the green-painters fight over who &apos;s going to paint that bit behind the curtain ? No .
Your brain just lets it go . The brain doesn &apos;t need to fill that in .
When I first started talking about the Bradley , Petrie , Dumais example that you just saw — I &apos;ll go back to it , this one — I said that there was no filling-in behind there .
And I supposed that that was just a flat truth , always true .
But Rob Van Lier has recently shown that it isn &apos;t .
Now , if you think you see some pale yellow — I &apos;ll run this a few more times .
Look in the gray areas , and see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy moving in there — yeah , it &apos;s amazing . There &apos;s nothing there . It &apos;s no trick .
Let me just pause this for a second if I can .
This is change-blindness .
What you &apos;re going to see is two pictures , one of which is slightly different from the other .
You see here the red roof and the gray roof , and in between them there will be a mask , which is just a blank screen , for about a quarter of a second .
So you &apos;ll see the first picture , then a mask , then the second picture , then a mask .
And this will just continue , and your job as the subject is to press the button when you see the change .
So , show the original picture for 240 milliseconds . Blank .
Show the next picture for 240 milliseconds . Blank .
And keep going , until the subject presses the button , saying , &quot; I see the change . &quot;
So now we &apos;re going to be subjects in the experiment .
We &apos;re going to start easy . Some examples .
No trouble there .
Can everybody see ? All right .
Indeed , Rensink &apos;s subjects took only a little bit more than a second to press the button .
Can you see that one ?
2.9 seconds .
How many don &apos;t see it still ?
What &apos;s on the roof of that barn ?
( Laughter ) It &apos;s easy .
Is it a bridge or a dock ?
There are a few more really dramatic ones , and then I &apos;ll close .
I want you to see a few that are particularly striking .
This one because it &apos;s so large and yet it &apos;s pretty hard to see .
Can you see it ?
Audience : Yes .
Dan Dennett : See the shadows going back and forth ? Pretty big .
So 15.5 seconds is the median time for subjects in his experiment there .
I love this one . I &apos;ll end with this one , just because it &apos;s such an obvious and important thing .
How many still don &apos;t see it ? How many still don &apos;t see it ?
How many engines on the wing of that Boeing ?
( Laughter ) Right in the middle of the picture !
Thanks very much for your attention .
What I wanted to show you is that scientists , using their from-the-outside , third-person methods , can tell you things about your own consciousness that you would never dream of , and that , in fact , you &apos;re not the authority on your own consciousness that you think you are .
And we &apos;re really making a lot of progress on coming up with a theory of mind .
Jeff Hawkins , this morning , was describing his attempt to get theory , and a good , big theory , into the neuroscience .
And he &apos;s right . This is a problem .
Harvard Medical School once — I was at a talk — director of the lab said , &quot; &quot; In our lab , we have a saying .
If you work on one neuron , that &apos;s neuroscience .
If you work on two neurons , that &apos;s psychology . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We have to have more theory , and it can come as much from the top down .
( Applause )
Today I &apos;m going to show you an electric vehicle that weighs less than a bicycle , that you can carry with you anywhere , that you can charge off a normal wall outlet in 15 minutes , and you can run it for 1,000 kilometers on about a dollar of electricity .
But when I say the word electric vehicle , people think about vehicles . They think about cars and motorcycles and bicycles , and the vehicles that you use every day .
But if you come about it from a different perspective , you can create some more interesting , more novel concepts .
So we built something .
I &apos;ve got some of the pieces in my pocket here .
So this is the motor .
This motor has enough power to take you up the hills of San Francisco at about 20 miles per hour , about 30 kilometers an hour , and this battery , this battery right here has about six miles of range , or 10 kilometers , which is enough to cover about half of the car trips in the U.S. alone .
But the best part about these components is that we bought them at a toy store .
These are from remote control airplanes .
And the performance of these things has gotten so good that if you think about vehicles a little bit differently , you can really change things .
So today we &apos;re going to show you one example of how you can use this .
Pay attention to not only how fun this thing is , but also how the portability that comes with this can totally change the way you interact with a city like San Francisco .
( Music ) &#91; 6 Mile Range &#93; &#91; Top Speed Near 20mph &#93; &#91; Uphill Climbing &#93; &#91; Regenerative Braking &#93; ( Applause ) ( Cheers ) So we &apos;re going to show you what this thing can do .
It &apos;s really maneuverable . You have a hand-held remote , so you can pretty easily control acceleration , braking , go in reverse if you like , also have braking .
It &apos;s incredible just how light this thing is .
I mean , this is something you can pick up and carry with you anywhere you go .
So I &apos;ll leave you with one of the most compelling facts about this technology and these kinds of vehicles .
This uses 20 times less energy for every mile or kilometer that you travel than a car , which means not only is this thing fast to charge and really cheap to build , but it also reduces the footprint of your energy use in terms of your transportation .
So instead of looking at large amounts of energy needed for each person in this room to get around in a city , now you can look at much smaller amounts and more sustainable transportation .
So next time you think about a vehicle , I hope , like us , you &apos;re thinking about something new .
Thank you .

I ’ m going around the world giving talks about Darwin , and usually what I ’ m talking about is Darwin ’ s strange inversion of reasoning .
Now that title , that phrase , comes from a critic , an early critic , and this is a passage that I just love , and would like to read for you .
&quot; &quot; In the theory with which we have to deal , Absolute Ignorance is the artificer ; so that we may enunciate as the fundamental principle of the whole system , that , in order to make a perfect and beautiful machine , it is not requisite to know how to make it .
This proposition will be found on careful examination to express , in condensed form , the essential purport of the Theory , and to express in a few words all Mr. Darwin ’ s meaning ; who , by a strange inversion of reasoning , seems to think Absolute Ignorance fully qualified to take the place of Absolute Wisdom in the achievements of creative skill . &quot; &quot; Exactly . Exactly . And it is a strange inversion .
A creationist pamphlet has this wonderful page in it : &quot; &quot; Test Two : Do you know of any building that didn ’ t have a builder ? Yes / No .
Do you know of any painting that didn ’ t have a painter ? Yes / No .
Do you know of any car that didn ’ t have a maker ? Yes / No .
If you answered &apos; Yes &apos; for any of the above , give details . &quot; &quot; A-ha ! I mean , it really is a strange inversion of reasoning .
You would have thought it stands to reason that design requires an intelligent designer .
But Darwin shows that it ’ s just false .
Today , though , I ’ m going to talk about Darwin ’ s other strange inversion , which is equally puzzling at first , but in some ways just as important .
It stands to reason that we love chocolate cake because it is sweet .
Guys go for girls like this because they are sexy .
We adore babies because they ’ re so cute .
And , of course , we are amused by jokes because they are funny .
This is all backwards . It is . And Darwin shows us why .
Let ’ s start with sweet . Our sweet tooth is basically an evolved sugar detector , because sugar is high energy , and it ’ s just been wired up to the preferer , to put it very crudely , and that ’ s why we like sugar .
Honey is sweet because we like it , not &quot; &quot; we like it because honey is sweet . &quot; &quot; There ’ s nothing intrinsically sweet about honey .
If you looked at glucose molecules till you were blind , you wouldn ’ t see why they tasted sweet .
You have to look in our brains to understand why they ’ re sweet .
So if you think first there was sweetness , and then we evolved to like sweetness , you ’ ve got it backwards ; that ’ s just wrong . It ’ s the other way round .
Sweetness was born with the wiring which evolved .
And there ’ s nothing intrinsically sexy about these young ladies .
And it ’ s a good thing that there isn ’ t , because if there were , then Mother Nature would have a problem : How on earth do you get chimps to mate ?
Now you might think , ah , there ’ s a solution : hallucinations .
That would be one way of doing it , but there ’ s a quicker way .
Just wire the chimps up to love that look , and apparently they do .
That ’ s all there is to it .
Over six million years , we and the chimps evolved our different ways .
We became bald-bodied , oddly enough ; for one reason or another , they didn ’ t .
If we hadn ’ t , then probably this would be the height of sexiness .
Our sweet tooth is an evolved and instinctual preference for high-energy food .
It wasn ’ t designed for chocolate cake .
Chocolate cake is a supernormal stimulus .
The term is owed to Niko Tinbergen , who did his famous experiments with gulls , where he found that that orange spot on the gull ’ s beak — if he made a bigger , oranger spot the gull chicks would peck at it even harder .
It was a hyperstimulus for them , and they loved it .
What we see with , say , chocolate cake is it ’ s a supernormal stimulus to tweak our design wiring .
And there are lots of supernormal stimuli ; chocolate cake is one .
There &apos;s lots of supernormal stimuli for sexiness .
And there &apos;s even supernormal stimuli for cuteness . Here ’ s a pretty good example .
It ’ s important that we love babies , and that we not be put off by , say , messy diapers .
So babies have to attract our affection and our nurturing , and they do .
And , by the way , a recent study shows that mothers prefer the smell of the dirty diapers of their own baby .
So nature works on many levels here .
But now , if babies didn ’ t look the way they do — if babies looked like this , that ’ s what we would find adorable , that ’ s what we would find — we would think , oh my goodness , do I ever want to hug that .
This is the strange inversion .
Well now , finally what about funny . My answer is , it ’ s the same story , the same story .
This is the hard one , the one that isn ’ t obvious . That ’ s why I leave it to the end .
And I won ’ t be able to say too much about it .
But you have to think evolutionarily , you have to think , what hard job that has to be done — it ’ s dirty work , somebody ’ s got to do it — is so important to give us such a powerful , inbuilt reward for it when we succeed .
Now , I think we &apos;ve found the answer — I and a few of my colleagues .
It ’ s a neural system that ’ s wired up to reward the brain for doing a grubby clerical job .
Our bumper sticker for this view is that this is the joy of debugging .
Now I ’ m not going to have time to spell it all out , but I ’ ll just say that only some kinds of debugging get the reward .
And what we ’ re doing is we ’ re using humor as a sort of neuroscientific probe by switching humor on and off , by turning the knob on a joke — now it ’ s not funny ... oh , now it ’ s funnier ...
now we ’ ll turn a little bit more ... now it ’ s not funny — in this way , we can actually learn something about the architecture of the brain , the functional architecture of the brain .
Matthew Hurley is the first author of this . We call it the Hurley Model .
He ’ s a computer scientist , Reginald Adams a psychologist , and there I am , and we ’ re putting this together into a book .
Thank you very much .
You sir , that &apos;s three .
And anybody on this side here ?
Would somebody get us started by giving us a two-digit number , please ?
AB : 22 . And another two-digit number , sir ?
AB : 594 . Let &apos;s give three of them a nice round of applause there .

Audience : 25 .
AB : 23 squared , OK .
Volunteer : 529 . AB : 529 .
Volunteer : 3481 . AB : 3481 .

There was a gentleman up here who had a 10-digit calculator .
You have a 10-digit calculator , sir , as well ?
Oh , I did this row already .
I &apos;m going to break the problem down into three parts .
Now , let me recap .
Let me explain what that is .
If , however , I am right , whatever you do , don &apos;t keep it to yourself , OK ?
77,862 becomes cookie fission , cookie fission is 77,822 .
That seems right , I &apos;ll go on . Cookie fission , OK .
Audience : Yeah ! AB : Good .
Thank you very much .
I wanted to be a rock star .
I dreamed of it , and that &apos;s all I dreamed of .
To be more accurate , I wanted to be a pop star .
This was in the late &apos; 80s .
And mostly I wanted to be the fifth member of Depeche Mode or Duran Duran .
They wouldn &apos;t have me .
I didn &apos;t read music , but I played synthesizers and drum machines .
And I grew up in this little farming town in northern Nevada .
And I was certain that &apos;s what my life would be .
And when I went to college at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas when I was 18 , I was stunned to find that there was not a Pop Star 101 , or even a degree program for that interest .
And the choir conductor there knew that I sang and invited me to come and join the choir .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I would love to do that . It sounds great . &quot; &quot; And I left the room and said , &quot; &quot; No way . &quot; &quot; The choir people in my high school were pretty geeky , and there was no way I was going to have anything to do with those people .
And about a week later , a friend of mine came to me and said , &quot; &quot; Listen , you &apos;ve got to join choir .
At the end of the semester , we &apos;re taking a trip to Mexico , all expenses paid .
And the soprano section is just full of hot girls . &quot; &quot; And so I figured for Mexico and babes , I could do just about anything .
And I went to my first day in choir , and I sat down with the basses and sort of looked over my shoulder to see what they were doing .
They opened their scores , the conductor gave the downbeat , and boom , they launched into the Kyrie from the &quot; &quot; Requiem &quot; &quot; by Mozart .
In my entire life I had seen in black and white , and suddenly everything was in shocking Technicolor .
The most transformative experience I &apos;ve ever had — in that single moment , hearing dissonance and harmony and people singing , people together , the shared vision .
And I felt for the first time in my life that I was part of something bigger than myself .
And there were a lot of cute girls in the soprano section , as it turns out .
I decided to write a piece for choir a couple of years later as a gift to this conductor who had changed my life .
I had learned to read music by then , or slowly learning to read music .
And that piece was published , and then I wrote another piece , and that got published .
And then I started conducting , and I ended up doing my master &apos;s degree at the Juilliard School .
And I find myself now in the unlikely position of standing in front of all of you as a professional classical composer and conductor .
Well a couple of years ago , a friend of mine emailed me a link , a YouTube link , and said , &quot; &quot; You have got to see this . &quot; &quot; And it was this young woman who had posted a fan video to me , singing the soprano line to a piece of mine called &quot; &quot; Sleep . &quot; &quot; ( Video ) Britlin Losee : Hi Mr. Eric Whitacre .
My name is Britlin Losee , and this is a video that I &apos;d like to make for you .
Here &apos;s me singing &quot; &quot; Sleep . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a little nervous , just to let you know .
♫ If there are noises ♫ ♫ in the night ♫ Eric Whitacre : I was thunderstruck .
Britlin was so innocent and so sweet , and her voice was so pure .
And I even loved seeing behind her ; I could see the little teddy bear sitting on the piano behind her in her room .
Such an intimate video .
And I had this idea : if I could get 50 people to all do this same thing , sing their parts — soprano , alto , tenor and bass — wherever they were in the world , post their videos to YouTube , we could cut it all together and create a virtual choir .
So I wrote on my blog , &quot; &quot; OMG OMG . &quot; &quot; I actually wrote , &quot; &quot; OMG , &quot; &quot; hopefully for the last time in public ever .
( Laughter ) And I sent out this call to singers .
And I made free the download of the music to a piece that I had written in the year 2000 called &quot; &quot; Lux Aurumque , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; light and gold . &quot; &quot; And lo and behold , people started uploading their videos .
Now I should say , before that , what I did is I posted a conductor track of myself conducting .
And it &apos;s in complete silence when I filmed it , because I was only hearing the music in my head , imagining the choir that would one day come to be .
Afterwards , I played a piano track underneath so that the singers would have something to listen to .
And then as the videos started to come in ...
( Singing ) This is Cheryl Ang from Singapore . ( Singing )
This is Evangelina Etienne ( Singing ) from Massachusetts . ( Singing )
Stephen Hanson from Sweden . ( Singing )
This is Jamal Walker from Dallas , Texas . ( Singing )
There was even a little soprano solo in the piece , and so I had auditions .
And a number of sopranos uploaded their parts .
I was told later , and also by lots of singers who were involved in this , that they sometimes recorded 50 or 60 different takes until they got just the right take — they uploaded it .
Here &apos;s our winner of the soprano solo .
This is Melody Myers from Tennessee .
( Singing ) I love the little smile she does right over the top of the note — like , &quot; &quot; No problem , everything &apos;s fine . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And from the crowd emerged this young man , Scott Haines .
And he said , &quot; &quot; Listen , this is the project I &apos;ve been looking for my whole life .
I &apos;d like to be the person to edit this all together . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you , Scott . I &apos;m so glad that you found me . &quot; &quot; And Scott aggregated all of the videos .
He scrubbed the audio .
He made sure that everything lined up .
And then we posted this video to YouTube about a year and a half ago .
This is &quot; &quot; Lux Aurumque &quot; &quot; sung by the Virtual Choir .
( Singing ) I &apos;ll stop it there in the interest of time .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you .
So there &apos;s more . There &apos;s more . Thank you so much . And I had the same reaction you did . I actually was moved to tears when I first saw it . I just couldn &apos;t believe the poetry of all of it —
these souls all on their own desert island , sending electronic messages in bottles to each other .
And the video went viral .
We had a million hits in the first month and got a lot of attention for it .
And because of that , then a lot of singers started saying , &quot; All right , what &apos;s Virtual Choir 2.0 ? &quot;
And so I decided for Virtual Choir 2.0 that I would choose the same piece that Britlin was singing , &quot; &quot; Sleep , &quot; &quot; which is another work that I wrote in the year 2000 — poetry by my dear friend Charles Anthony Silvestri .
And again , I posted a conductor video , and we started accepting submissions .
This time we got some more mature members .
( Singing ) And some younger members .
( Video ) Soprano : ♫ Upon my pillow ♫ ♫ Safe in bed ♫ EW : That &apos;s Georgie from England . She &apos;s only nine .
Isn &apos;t that the sweetest thing you &apos;ve ever seen ?
Someone did all eight videos — a bass even singing the soprano parts .
This is Beau Awtin .
( Video ) Beau Awtin : ♫ Safe in bed ♫ EW : And our goal — it was sort of an arbitrary goal — there was an MTV video where they all sang &quot; &quot; Lollipop &quot; &quot; and they got people from all over the world to just sing that little melody .
And there were 900 people involved in that .
So I told the singers , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s our goal .
That &apos;s the number for us to beat . &quot; &quot; And we just closed submissions January 10th , and our final tally was 2,051 videos from 58 different countries .
Thank you .
( Applause ) From Malta , Madagascar , Thailand , Vietnam , Jordan , Egypt , Israel , as far north as Alaska and as far south as New Zealand .
And we also put a page on Facebook for the singers to upload their testimonials , what it was like for them , their experience singing it .
And I &apos;ve just chosen a few of them here .
&quot; &quot; My sister and I used to sing in choirs together constantly .
Now she &apos;s an airman in the air force constantly traveling .
It &apos;s so wonderful to sing together again ! &quot; &quot; I love the idea that she &apos;s singing with her sister .
&quot; &quot; Aside from the beautiful music , it &apos;s great just to know I &apos;m part of a worldwide community of people I never met before , but who are connected anyway . &quot; &quot; And my personal favorite , &quot; &quot; When I told my husband that I was going to be a part of this , he told me that I did not have the voice for it . &quot; &quot; Yeah , I &apos;m sure a lot of you have heard that too .
Me too .
&quot; &quot; It hurt so much , and I shed some tears , but something inside of me wanted to do this despite his words .
It is a dream come true to be part of this choir , as I &apos;ve never been part of one .
When I placed a marker on the Google Earth Map , I had to go with the nearest city , which is about 400 miles away from where I live .
As I am in the Great Alaskan Bush , satellite is my connection to the world . &quot; &quot; So two things struck me deeply about this .
The first is that human beings will go to any lengths necessary to find and connect with each other .
It doesn &apos;t matter the technology .
And the second is that people seem to be experiencing an actual connection .
It wasn &apos;t a virtual choir .
There are people now online that are friends ; they &apos;ve never met .
But , I know myself too , I feel this virtual esprit de corps , if you will , with all of them .
I feel a closeness to this choir — almost like a family .
What I &apos;d like to close with then today is the first look at &quot; &quot; Sleep &quot; &quot; by Virtual Choir 2.0 .
This will be a premiere today .
We &apos;re not finished with the video yet .
You can imagine , with 2,000 synchronized YouTube videos , the render time is just atrocious .
But we do have the first three minutes .
And it &apos;s a tremendous honor for me to be able to show it to you here first .
You &apos;re the very first people to see this .
This is &quot; &quot; Sleep , &quot; &quot; the Virtual Choir .
( Video ) Virtual Choir : ♫ The evening hangs ♫ ♫ beneath the moon ♫ ♫ A silver thread on darkened dune ♫ ♫ With closing eyes and resting head ♫ ♫ I know that sleep is coming soon ♫ ♫ Upon my pillow , ♫ ♫ safe in bed , ♫ ♫ a thousand pictures fill my head ♫ ♫ I cannot sleep ♫ ♫ my mind &apos;s aflight ♫ ♫ and yet my limbs seem made of lead ♫ ♫ If there are noises in the night ♫ Eric Whitacre : Thank you very , very much . Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you very much . Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Hi . I &apos;m going to talk to you today about laughter , and I just want to start by thinking about the first time I can ever remember noticing laughter .
This is when I was a little girl . I would &apos;ve been about six .
And I came across my parents doing something unusual , where they were laughing .
They were laughing very , very hard .
They were lying on the floor laughing .
They were screaming with laughter .
I did not know what they were laughing at , but I wanted in .
I wanted to be part of that , and I kind of sat around at the edge going , &quot; &quot; Hoo hoo ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , incidentally , what they were laughing at was a song which people used to sing , which was based around signs in toilets on trains telling you what you could and could not do in toilets on trains .
And the thing you have to remember about the English is , of course , we do have an immensely sophisticated sense of humor .
( Laughter ) At the time , though , I didn &apos;t understand anything of that .
I just cared about the laughter , and actually , as a neuroscientist , I &apos;ve come to care about it again .
And it is a really weird thing to do .
What I &apos;m going to do now is just play some examples of real human beings laughing , and I want you think about the sound people make and how odd that can be , and in fact how primitive laughter is as a sound .
It &apos;s much more like an animal call than it is like speech .
So here we &apos;ve got some laughter for you . The first one is pretty joyful .
( Audio : Laughing ) Now this next guy , I need him to breathe .
There &apos;s a point in there where I &apos;m just , like , you &apos;ve got to get some air in there , mate , because he just sounds like he &apos;s breathing out .
( Audio : Laughing ) This hasn &apos;t been edited ; this is him .
( Audio : Laughing ) ( Laughter ) And finally we have — this is a human female laughing .
And laughter can take us to some pretty odd places in terms of making noises .
( Audio : Laughing ) She actually says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , what is that ? &quot; &quot; in French .
We &apos;re all kind of with her . I have no idea .
Now , to understand laughter , you have to look at a part of the body that psychologists and neuroscientists don &apos;t normally spend much time looking at , which is the ribcage , and it doesn &apos;t seem terribly exciting , but actually you &apos;re all using your ribcage all the time .
So what I &apos;m doing now is you see something much more like this .
Now , both talking and breathing has a mortal enemy , and that enemy is laughter , because what happens when you laugh is those same muscles start to contract very regularly , and you get this very marked sort of zig-zagging , and that &apos;s just squeezing the air out of you .
It literally is that basic a way of making a sound .
You could be stamping on somebody , it &apos;s having the same effect .
You &apos;re just squeezing air out , and each of those contractions — Ha ! — gives you a sound .
And as the contractions run together , you can get these spasms , and that &apos;s when you start getting these — ( Wheezing ) — things happening .
I &apos;m brilliant at this . ( Laughter ) Now , in terms of the science of laughter , there isn &apos;t very much , but it does turn out that pretty much everything we think we know about laughter is wrong .
So it &apos;s not at all unusual , for example , to hear people to say humans are the only animals that laugh .
Nietzsche thought that humans are the only animals that laugh .
It &apos;s been well-described and well-observed in primates , but you also see it in rats , and wherever you find it — humans , primates , rats — you find it associated with things like tickling .
That &apos;s the same for humans .
You find it associated with play , and all mammals play .
And wherever you find it , it &apos;s associated with interactions .
So Robert Provine , who has done a lot of work on this , has pointed out that you are 30 times more likely to laugh if you are with somebody else than if you &apos;re on your own , and where you find most laughter is in social interactions like conversation .
So if you ask human beings , &quot; &quot; When do you laugh ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;ll talk about comedy and they &apos;ll talk about humor and they &apos;ll talk about jokes .
If you look at when they laugh , they &apos;re laughing with their friends .
And when we laugh with people , we &apos;re hardly ever actually laughing at jokes .
You are laughing to show people that you understand them , that you agree with them , that you &apos;re part of the same group as them .
You &apos;re laughing to show that you like them .
You might even love them .
You &apos;re doing all that at the same time as talking to them , and the laughter is doing a lot of that emotional work for you .
Now , something I &apos;ve got very interested in is different kinds of laughter , and we have some neurobiological evidence about how human beings vocalize that suggests there might be two kinds of laughs that we have .
So it seems possible that the neurobiology for helpless , involuntary laughter , like my parents lying on the floor screaming about a silly song , might have a different basis to it than some of that more polite social laughter that you encounter , which isn &apos;t horrible laughter , but it &apos;s behavior somebody is doing as part of their communicative act to you , part of their interaction with you ; they are choosing to do this .
In our evolution , we have developed two different ways of vocalizing .
Involuntary vocalizations are part of an older system than the more voluntary vocalizations like the speech I &apos;m doing now .
So we might imagine that laughter might actually have two different roots .
So I &apos;ve been looking at this in more detail .
To do this , we &apos;ve had to make recordings of people laughing , and we &apos;ve had to do whatever it takes to make people laugh , and we got those same people to produce more posed , social laughter .
So imagine your friend told a joke , and you &apos;re laughing because you like your friend , but not really because the joke &apos;s all that .
So I &apos;m going to play you a couple of those .
I want you to tell me if you think this laughter is real laughter , or if you think it &apos;s posed .
So is this involuntary laughter or more voluntary laughter ?
( Audio : Laughing ) What does that sound like to you ?
Audience : Posed . Sophie Scott : Posed ? Posed .
How about this one ?
( Audio : Laughing ) ( Laughter ) I &apos;m the best .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Not really .
No , that was helpless laughter , and in fact , to record that , all they had to do was record me watching one of my friends listening to something I knew she wanted to laugh at , and I just started doing this .
Interestingly , you see something quite similar with chimpanzees .
In contrast , posed laughter , we might think it sounds a bit fake .
Actually , it &apos;s not , it &apos;s actually an important social cue .
We use it a lot , we &apos;re choosing to laugh in a lot of situations , and it seems to be its own thing .
So , for example , you find nasality in posed laughter , that kind of &quot; &quot; ha ha ha ha ha &quot; &quot; sound that you never get , you could not do , if you were laughing involuntarily .
So they do seem to be genuinely these two different sorts of things .
And when you do this , this is a really boring experiment .
We just played people real and posed laughs .
We didn &apos;t tell them it was a study on laughter .
We put other sounds in there to distract them , and all they &apos;re doing is lying listening to sounds .
We don &apos;t tell them to do anything .
Nonetheless , when you hear real laughter and when you hear posed laughter , the brains are responding completely differently , significantly differently .
What you see in the regions in blue , which lies in auditory cortex , are the brain areas that respond more to the real laughs , and what seems to be the case , when you hear somebody laughing involuntarily , you hear sounds you would never hear in any other context .
It &apos;s very unambiguous , and it seems to be associated with greater auditory processing of these novel sounds .
In contrast , when you hear somebody laughing in a posed way , what you see are these regions in pink , which are occupying brain areas associated with mentalizing , thinking about what somebody else is thinking .
And I think what that means is , even if you &apos;re having your brain scanned , which is completely boring and not very interesting , when you hear somebody going , &quot; &quot; A ha ha ha ha ha , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re trying to work out why they &apos;re laughing .
Laughter is always meaningful .
You are always trying to understand it in context , even if , as far as you are concerned , at that point in time , it has not necessarily anything to do with you , you still want to know why those people are laughing .
So six-year-olds are at chance , they can &apos;t really hear the difference .
By the time you are older , you get better , but interestingly , you do not hit peak performance in this dataset until you are in your late 30s and early 40s .
You don &apos;t understand laughter fully by the time you hit puberty .
You don &apos;t understand laughter fully by the time your brain has matured at the end of your teens .
You &apos;re learning about laughter throughout your entire early adult life .
You really can see this .
Now everybody , young and old , finds the real laughs more contagious than the posed laughs , but as you get older , it all becomes less contagious to you .
Now , either we &apos;re all just becoming really grumpy as we get older , or it may mean that as you understand laughter better , and you are getting better at doing that , you need more than just hearing people laugh to want to laugh .
You need the social stuff there .
So we &apos;ve got a very interesting behavior about which a lot of our lay assumptions are incorrect , but I &apos;m coming to see that actually there &apos;s even more to laughter than it &apos;s an important social emotion we should look at , because it turns out people are phenomenally nuanced in terms of how we use laughter .
There &apos;s a really lovely set of studies coming out from Robert Levenson &apos;s lab in California , where he &apos;s doing a longitudinal study with couples .
He gets married couples , men and women , into the lab , and he gives them stressful conversations to have while he wires them up to a polygraph so he can see them becoming stressed .
So you &apos;ve got the two of them in there , and he &apos;ll say to the husband , &quot; Tell me something that your wife does that irritates you . &quot;
And what you see is immediately — just run that one through your head briefly , you and your partner — you can imagine everybody gets a bit more stressed as soon as that starts .
You can see physically , people become more stressed .
What he finds is that the couples who manage that feeling of stress with laughter , positive emotions like laughter , not only immediately become less stressed , they can see them physically feeling better , they &apos;re dealing with this unpleasant situation better together , they are also the couples that report high levels of satisfaction in their relationship and they stay together for longer .
So in fact , when you look at close relationships , laughter is a phenomenally useful index of how people are regulating their emotions together .
Now , I don &apos;t think this is going to be limited to romantic relationships .
I think this is probably going to be a characteristic of close emotional relationships such as you might have with friends , which explains my next clip , which is of a YouTube video of some young men in the former East Germany on making a video to promote their heavy metal band , and it &apos;s extremely macho , and the mood is very serious , and I want you to notice what happens in terms of laughter when things go wrong and how quickly that happens , and how that changes the mood .
He &apos;s cold . He &apos;s about to get wet . He &apos;s got swimming trunks on , got a towel .
Ice .
What might possibly happen ?
Video starts .
Serious mood .
And his friends are already laughing . They are already laughing , hard .
He &apos;s not laughing yet .
( Laughter ) He &apos;s starting to go now .
And now they &apos;re all off .
( Laughter ) They &apos;re on the floor . ( Laughter )
The thing I really like about that is it &apos;s all very serious until he jumps onto the ice , and as soon as he doesn &apos;t go through the ice , but also there isn &apos;t blood and bone everywhere , his friends start laughing .
It was a very basic reaction to find some reason we can do this .
We can laugh together . We &apos;re going to get through this .
We &apos;re going to be okay .
And in fact , all of us are doing this all the time .
You do it so often , you don &apos;t even notice it .
Everybody underestimates how often they laugh , and you &apos;re doing something , when you laugh with people , that &apos;s actually letting you access a really ancient evolutionary system that mammals have evolved to make and maintain social bonds , and clearly to regulate emotions , to make ourselves feel better .
It &apos;s not something specific to humans — it &apos;s a really ancient behavior which really helps us regulate how we feel and makes us feel better .
In other words , when it comes to laughter , you and me , baby , ain &apos;t nothing but mammals . ( Laughter ) Thank you .
Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m a neuroscientist , and I study decision-making .
I do experiments to test how different chemicals in the brain influence the choices we make .
I &apos;m here to tell you the secret to successful decision-making : a cheese sandwich .
That &apos;s right . According to scientists , a cheese sandwich is the solution to all your tough decisions .
How do I know ? I &apos;m the scientist who did the study .
A few years ago , my colleagues and I were interested in how a brain chemical called serotonin would influence people &apos;s decisions in social situations .
Specifically , we wanted to know how serotonin would affect the way people react when they &apos;re treated unfairly .
So we did an experiment .
We manipulated people &apos;s serotonin levels by giving them this really disgusting-tasting artificial lemon-flavored drink that works by taking away the raw ingredient for serotonin in the brain .
This is the amino acid tryptophan .
So what we found was , when tryptophan was low , people were more likely to take revenge when they &apos;re treated unfairly .
That &apos;s the study we did , and here are some of the headlines that came out afterwards .
( &quot; &quot; A cheese sandwich is all you need for strong decision-making &quot; &quot; ) ( &quot; &quot; What a friend we have in cheeses &quot; &quot; ) ( &quot; &quot; Eating Cheese and Meat May Boost Self-Control &quot; &quot; ) At this point , you might be wondering , did I miss something ?
( &quot; &quot; Official ! Chocolate stops you being grumpy &quot; &quot; ) Cheese ? Chocolate ? Where did that come from ?
And I thought the same thing myself when these came out , because our study had nothing to do with cheese or chocolate .
We gave people this horrible-tasting drink that affected their tryptophan levels .
But it turns out that tryptophan also happens to be found in cheese and chocolate .
And of course when science says cheese and chocolate help you make better decisions , well , that &apos;s sure to grab people &apos;s attention .
So there you have it : the evolution of a headline .
When this happened , a part of me thought , well , what &apos;s the big deal ?
So the media oversimplified a few things , but in the end , it &apos;s just a news story .
And I think a lot of scientists have this attitude .
But the problem is that this kind of thing happens all the time , and it affects not just the stories you read in the news but also the products you see on the shelves .
When the headlines rolled , what happened was , the marketers came calling .
Would I be willing to provide a scientific endorsement of a mood-boosting bottled water ?
Or would I go on television to demonstrate , in front of a live audience , that comfort foods really do make you feel better ?
I think these folks meant well , but had I taken them up on their offers , I would have been going beyond the science , and good scientists are careful not to do this .
But nevertheless , neuroscience is turning up more and more in marketing .
Here &apos;s one example : Neuro drinks , a line of products , including Nuero Bliss here , which according to its label helps reduce stress , enhances mood , provides focused concentration , and promotes a positive outlook .
I have to say , this sounds awesome . ( Laughter ) I could totally have used this 10 minutes ago .
So when this came up in my local shop , naturally I was curious about some of the research backing these claims .
So I went to the company &apos;s website looking to find some controlled trials of their products .
But I didn &apos;t find any .
Trial or no trial , these claims are front and center on their label right next to a picture of a brain .
And it turns out that pictures of brains have special properties .
A couple of researchers asked a few hundred people to read a scientific article .
For half the people , the article included a brain image , and for the other half , it was the same article but it didn &apos;t have a brain image .
At the end — you see where this is going — people were asked whether they agreed with the conclusions of the article .
So this is how much people agree with the conclusions with no image .
And this is how much they agree with the same article that did include a brain image .
So the take-home message here is , do you want to sell it ? Put a brain on it .
Now let me pause here and take a moment to say that neuroscience has advanced a lot in the last few decades , and we &apos;re constantly discovering amazing things about the brain .
Like , just a couple of weeks ago , neuroscientists at MIT figured out how to break habits in rats just by controlling neural activity in a specific part of their brain .
Really cool stuff .
But the promise of neuroscience has led to some really high expectations and some overblown , unproven claims .
So what I &apos;m going to do is show you how to spot a couple of classic moves , dead giveaways , really , for what &apos;s variously been called neuro-bunk , neuro-bollocks , or , my personal favorite , neuro-flapdoodle .
So the first unproven claim is that you can use brain scans to read people &apos;s thoughts and emotions .
Here &apos;s a study published by a team of researchers as an op-ed in The New York Times .
The headline ? &quot; &quot; You Love Your iPhone . Literally . &quot; &quot; It quickly became the most emailed article on the site .
So how &apos;d they figure this out ?
They put 16 people inside a brain scanner and showed them videos of ringing iPhones .
The brain scans showed activation in a part of the brain called the insula , a region they say is linked to feelings of love and compassion .
So they concluded that because they saw activation in the insula , this meant the subjects loved their iPhones .
Now there &apos;s just one problem with this line of reasoning , and that &apos;s that the insula does a lot .
Sure , it is involved in positive emotions like love and compassion , but it &apos;s also involved in tons of other processes , like memory , language , attention , even anger , disgust and pain .
So based on the same logic , I could equally conclude you hate your iPhone .
The point here is , when you see activation in the insula , you can &apos;t just pick and choose your favorite explanation from off this list , and it &apos;s a really long list .
My colleagues Tal Yarkoni and Russ Poldrack have shown that the insula pops up in almost a third of all brain imaging studies that have ever been published .
So chances are really , really good that your insula is going off right now , but I won &apos;t kid myself to think this means you love me .
So speaking of love and the brain , there &apos;s a researcher , known to some as Dr. Love , who claims that scientists have found the glue that holds society together , the source of love and prosperity .
This time it &apos;s not a cheese sandwich .
No , it &apos;s a hormone called oxytocin .
You &apos;ve probably heard of it .
So , Dr. Love bases his argument on studies showing that when you boost people &apos;s oxytocin , this increases their trust , empathy and cooperation .
So he &apos;s calling oxytocin &quot; &quot; the moral molecule . &quot; &quot; Now these studies are scientifically valid , and they &apos;ve been replicated , but they &apos;re not the whole story .
Other studies have shown that boosting oxytocin increases envy . It increases gloating .
Oxytocin can bias people to favor their own group at the expense of other groups .
And in some cases , oxytocin can even decrease cooperation .
So based on these studies , I could say oxytocin is an immoral molecule , and call myself Dr. Strangelove .
( Laughter ) So we &apos;ve seen neuro-flapdoodle all over the headlines .
We see it in supermarkets , on book covers .
What about the clinic ?
SPECT imaging is a brain-scanning technology that uses a radioactive tracer to track blood flow in the brain .
For the bargain price of a few thousand dollars , there are clinics in the U.S. that will give you one of these SPECT scans and use the image to help diagnose your problems .
These scans , the clinics say , can help prevent Alzheimer &apos;s disease , solve weight and addiction issues , overcome marital conflicts , and treat , of course , a variety of mental illnesses ranging from depression to anxiety to ADHD .
This sounds great . A lot of people agree .
Some of these clinics are pulling in tens of millions of dollars a year in business .
There &apos;s just one problem .
The broad consensus in neuroscience is that we can &apos;t yet diagnose mental illness from a single brain scan .
But these clinics have treated tens of thousands of patients to date , many of them children , and SPECT imaging involves a radioactive injection , so exposing people to radiation , potentially harmful .
I am more excited than most people , as a neuroscientist , about the potential for neuroscience to treat mental illness and even maybe to make us better and smarter .
And if one day we can say that cheese and chocolate help us make better decisions , count me in .
But we &apos;re not there yet .
We haven &apos;t found a &quot; &quot; buy &quot; &quot; button inside the brain , we can &apos;t tell whether someone is lying or in love just by looking at their brain scans , and we can &apos;t turn sinners into saints with hormones .
Maybe someday we will , but until then , we have to be careful that we don &apos;t let overblown claims detract resources and attention away from the real science that &apos;s playing a much longer game .
So here &apos;s where you come in .
If someone tries to sell you something with a brain on it , don &apos;t just take them at their word .
Ask the tough questions . Ask to see the evidence .
Ask for the part of the story that &apos;s not being told .
The answers shouldn &apos;t be simple , because the brain isn &apos;t simple .
But that &apos;s not stopping us from trying to figure it out anyway .
Thank you . ( Applause )
Now , notice that the leader embraces him as an equal .
It takes guts to stand out like that .
So a movement must be public .
Now we &apos;ve got momentum . This is the tipping point .
And what a perfect place to do that , at TED .
I &apos;m going to talk about hackers .
And the image that comes to your mind when I say that word is probably not of Benjamin Franklin , but I &apos;m going to explain to you why it should be .
The image that comes to your mind is probably more likely of a pasty kid sitting in a basement doing something mischievous , or of a shady criminal who is trying to steal your identity , or of an international rogue with a political agenda .
And mainstream culture has kind of fed this idea that hackers are people that we should be afraid of .
For every hacker that &apos;s trying to steal your identity there &apos;s one that &apos;s building a tool that will help you find your loved ones after a disaster or to monitor environmental quality after an oil spill .
Hacking is really just any amateur innovation on an existing system , and it is a deeply democratic activity .
It &apos;s about critical thinking .
It &apos;s about questioning existing ways of doing things .
It &apos;s the idea that if you see a problem , you work to fix it , and not just complain about it .
And in many ways , hacking is what built America .
Betsy Ross was a hacker .
The Underground Railroad was a brilliant hack .
And from the Wright brothers to Steve Jobs , hacking has always been at the foundation of American democracy .
He was one of America &apos;s most prolific inventors , though he famously never filed a patent , because he thought that all human knowledge should be freely available .
He brought us bifocals and the lightning rod , and of course there was his collaboration on the invention of American democracy .
And in Code For America , we really try to embody the spirit of Ben Franklin .
He was a tinkerer and a statesman whose conception of citizenship was always predicated on action .
He believed that government could be built by the people , and we call those people civic hackers .
So it &apos;s no wonder that the values that underly a healthy democracy , like collaboration and empowerment and participation and enterprise , are the same values that underly the Internet .
And so it &apos;s no surprise that many hackers are turning their attention to the problem of government .
But before I give you a few examples of what civic hacking looks like , I want to make clear that you don &apos;t have to be a programmer to be a civic hacker .
So keep that in mind .
All of you are potential civic hackers .
So what does civic hacking look like ?
And it &apos;s a massive thing of tens of thousands of pages which just wasn &apos;t going to be possible in the few months that they had .
So instead , they decided to build a parallel site that better conformed to how citizens actually want to interact with information on a city website .
They &apos;re looking for answers to questions , and they want to take action when they &apos;re done , which is really hard to do from a site that looks like this .
So our team built Honolulu Answers , which is a super-simple search interface where you enter a search term or a question and get back plain language answers that drive a user towards action .
Now the site itself was easy enough to build , but the team was faced with the challenge of how they populate all of the content .
It would have taken the three of them a very long time , especially given that none of them are actually from Honolulu .
And so they did something that &apos;s really radical , when you think about how government is used to working .
They asked citizens to write the content .
So you &apos;ve heard of a hack-a-thon .
They held a write-a-thon , where on one Saturday afternoon — ( &quot; &quot; What do I do about wild pigs being a nuisance ? &quot; &quot; ) ( Laughter ) — Wild pigs are a huge problem in Honolulu , apparently .
Now , I think this is a really cool story in and of itself , but it gets more awesome .
I authored this answer , and a few others .
And I &apos;m trying to this day to articulate the sense of empowerment and responsibility that I feel for the place that I live based simply on this small act of participation .
And by stitching together my small act with the thousands of other small acts of participation that we &apos;re enabling through civic hacking , we think we can reenergize citizenship and restore trust in government .
At this point , you may be wondering what city officials think of all this .
So when you give citizens a way to participate beyond attending a town hall meeting , cities can actually capture the capacity in their communities to do the business of government .
Now I don &apos;t want to leave the impression that civic hacking is just an American phenomenon .
So this was just for the handful of legislators in the House .
And the contract was a two-year contract for 9.3 million dollars .
Now a lot of people were really angry about this , especially geeks who knew that 9.3 million dollars was an absolutely outrageous amount of money for what was a very simple app .
But instead of taking to the streets , they issued a challenge .
They asked programmers in Mexico to build something better and cheaper , and they offered a prize of 9,300 dollars — 10,000 times cheaper than the government contract , and they gave the entrants 10 days .
And in those 10 days , they submitted 173 apps , five of which were presented to Congress and are still in the app store today .
And because of this action , that contract was vacated , and now this has sparked a movement in Mexico City which is home to one of our partners , Code for Mexico City .
And so what you see in all three of these places , in Honolulu and in Oakland and in Mexico City , are the elements that are at the core of civic hacking .
They &apos;re creating a whole new set of ways for citizens to be involved , besides voting or signing a petition or protesting .
They can actually build government .
So back to our friend Ben Franklin , who , one of his lesser-known accomplishments was that in 1736 he founded the first volunteer firefighting company in Philadelphia , called a brigade .
And it &apos;s because he and his friends noticed that the city was having trouble keeping up with all the fires that were happening in the city , so in true civic hacker fashion , they built a solution .
And we have our own brigades at Code for America working on the projects that I &apos;ve just described , and we want to ask you to follow in Ben Franklin &apos;s footsteps and come join us .
We have 31 brigades in the U.S.
We are pleased to announce today that we &apos;re opening up the brigade to international cities for the first time , starting with cities in Poland and Japan and Ireland .
You can find out if there &apos;s a brigade where you live at brigade.codeforamerica.org , and if there &apos;s not a brigade where you live , we will help you .
Our goal is to create a global network of civic hackers who are innovating on the existing system in order to build tools that will solve entrenched problems , that will support local government , and that will empower citizens .
So please come hack with us .
Thank you .
I &apos;ll begin today by sharing a poem written by my friend from Malawi , Eileen Piri .
Eileen is only 13 years old , but when we were going through the collection of poetry that we wrote , I found her poem so interesting , so motivating .
So I &apos;ll read it to you .
She entitled her poem &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll Marry When I Want . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll marry when I want .
My mother can &apos;t force me to marry .
My father cannot force me to marry .
My uncle , my aunt , my brother or sister , cannot force me to marry .
No one in the world can force me to marry .
I &apos;ll marry when I want .
Even if you beat me , even if you chase me away , even if you do anything bad to me , I &apos;ll marry when I want .
I &apos;ll marry when I want , but not before I am well educated , and not before I am all grown up .
I &apos;ll marry when I want . &quot; &quot; This poem might seem odd , written by a 13-year-old girl , but where I and Eileen come from , this poem , which I have just read to you , is a warrior &apos;s cry .
I am from Malawi .
Malawi is one of the poorest countries , very poor , where gender equality is questionable .
Growing up in that country , I couldn &apos;t make my own choices in life .
I couldn &apos;t even explore personal opportunities in life .
I will tell you a story of two different girls , two beautiful girls .
These girls grew up under the same roof .
They were eating the same food .
Sometimes , they would share clothes , and even shoes .
But their lives ended up differently , in two different paths .
The other girl is my little sister .
My little sister was only 11 years old when she got pregnant .
It &apos;s a hurtful thing .
Not only did it hurt her , even me .
I was going through a hard time as well .
As it is in my culture , once you reach puberty stage , you are supposed to go to initiation camps .
In these initiation camps , you are taught how to sexually please a man .
There is this special day , which they call &quot; &quot; Very Special Day &quot; &quot; where a man who is hired by the community comes to the camp and sleeps with the little girls .
Imagine the trauma that these young girls go through every day .
Most girls end up pregnant .
They even contract HIV and AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases .
For my little sister , she ended up being pregnant .
Today , she &apos;s only 16 years old and she has three children .
Her first marriage did not survive , nor did her second marriage .
On the other side , there is this girl .
She &apos;s amazing .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I call her amazing because she is .
She &apos;s very fabulous .
That girl is me . ( Laughter ) When I was 13 years old , I was told , you are grown up , you have now reached of age , you &apos;re supposed to go to the initiation camp .
I was like , &quot; &quot; What ?
I &apos;m not going to go to the initiation camps . &quot; &quot; You know what the women said to me ?
&quot; &quot; You are a stupid girl . Stubborn .
You do not respect the traditions of our society , of our community . &quot; &quot; I said no because I knew where I was going .
I knew what I wanted in life .
I had a lot of dreams as a young girl .
I wanted to get well educated , to find a decent job in the future .
I was imagining myself as a lawyer , seated on that big chair .
Those were the imaginations that were going through my mind every day .
And I knew that one day , I would contribute something , a little something to my community .
But every day after refusing , women would tell me , &quot; &quot; Look at you , you &apos;re all grown up . Your little sister has a baby .
What about you ? &quot; &quot; That was the music that I was hearing every day , and that is the music that girls hear every day when they don &apos;t do something that the community needs them to do .
When I compared the two stories between me and my sister , I said , &quot; &quot; Why can &apos;t I do something ?
Why can &apos;t I change something that has happened for a long time in our community ? &quot; &quot; That was when I called other girls just like my sister , who have children , who have been in class but they have forgotten how to read and write .
I said , &quot; &quot; Come on , we can remind each other how to read and write again , how to hold the pen , how to read , to hold the book . &quot; &quot; It was a great time I had with them .
Nor did I just learn a little about them , but they were able to tell me their personal stories , what they were facing every day as young mothers .
That was when I was like , &apos; Why can &apos;t we take all these things that are happening to us and present them and tell our mothers , our traditional leaders , that these are the wrong things ? &quot; &quot; It was a scary thing to do , because these traditional leaders , they are already accustomed to the things that have been there for ages .
A hard thing to change , but a good thing to try .
So we tried .
It was very hard , but we pushed .
And I &apos;m here to say that in my community , it was the first community after girls pushed so hard to our traditional leader , and our leader stood up for us and said no girl has to be married before the age of 18 .
( Applause ) In my community , that was the first time a community , they had to call the bylaws , the first bylaw that protected girls in our community .
We did not stop there .
We forged ahead .
We were determined to fight for girls not just in my community , but even in other communities .
When the child marriage bill was being presented in February , we were there at the Parliament house .
Every day , when the members of Parliament were entering , we were telling them , &quot; &quot; Would you please support the bill ? &quot; &quot; And we don &apos;t have much technology like here , but we have our small phones .
So we said , &quot; &quot; Why can &apos;t we get their numbers and text them ? &quot; &quot; So we did that . It was a good thing .
( Applause ) So when the bill passed , we texted them back , &quot; Thank you for supporting the bill . &quot;
( Laughter ) And when the bill was signed by the president , making it into law , it was a plus .
Now , in Malawi , 18 is the legal marriage age , from 15 to 18 .
( Applause ) It &apos;s a good thing to know that the bill passed , but let me tell you this : There are countries where 18 is the legal marriage age , but don &apos;t we hear cries of women and girls every day ?
Every day , girls &apos; lives are being wasted away .
This is high time for leaders to honor their commitment .
In honoring this commitment , it means keeping girls &apos; issues at heart every time .
We don &apos;t have to be subjected as second , but they have to know that women , as we are in this room , we are not just women , we are not just girls , we are extraordinary .
We can do more .
And another thing for Malawi , and not just Malawi but other countries : The laws which are there , you know how a law is not a law until it is enforced ?
The law which has just recently passed and the laws that in other countries have been there , they need to be publicized at the local level , at the community level , where girls &apos; issues are very striking .
Girls face issues , difficult issues , at the community level every day .
So if these young girls know that there are laws that protect them , they will be able to stand up and defend themselves because they will know that there is a law that protects them .
And another thing I would say is that girls &apos; voices and women &apos;s voices are beautiful , they are there , but we cannot do this alone .
Male advocates , they have to jump in , to step in and work together .
It &apos;s a collective work .
What we need is what girls elsewhere need : good education , and above all , not to marry whilst 11 .
And furthermore , I know that together , we can transform the legal , the cultural and political framework that denies girls of their rights .
I am standing here today and declaring that we can end child marriage in a generation .
This is the moment where a girl and a girl , and millions of girls worldwide , will be able to say , &quot; I will marry when I want . &quot;
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m a lifelong traveler .
Even as a little kid , I was actually working out that it would be cheaper to go to boarding school in England than just to the best school down the road from my parents &apos; house in California .
So , from the time I was nine years old I was flying alone several times a year over the North Pole , just to go to school .
And of course the more I flew the more I came to love to fly , so the very week after I graduated from high school , I got a job mopping tables so that I could spend every season of my 18th year on a different continent .
And then , almost inevitably , I became a travel writer so my job and my joy could become one .
And I really began to feel that if you were lucky enough to walk around the candlelit temples of Tibet or to wander along the seafronts in Havana with music passing all around you , you could bring those sounds and the high cobalt skies and the flash of the blue ocean back to your friends at home , and really bring some magic and clarity to your own life .
Except , as you all know , one of the first things you learn when you travel is that nowhere is magical unless you can bring the right eyes to it .
You take an angry man to the Himalayas , he just starts complaining about the food .
And I found that the best way that I could develop more attentive and more appreciative eyes was , oddly , by going nowhere , just by sitting still .
And of course sitting still is how many of us get what we most crave and need in our accelerated lives , a break .
But it was also the only way that I could find to sift through the slideshow of my experience and make sense of the future and the past .
And so , to my great surprise , I found that going nowhere was at least as exciting as going to Tibet or to Cuba .
And by going nowhere , I mean nothing more intimidating than taking a few minutes out of every day or a few days out of every season , or even , as some people do , a few years out of a life in order to sit still long enough to find out what moves you most , to recall where your truest happiness lies and to remember that sometimes making a living and making a life point in opposite directions .
And of course , this is what wise beings through the centuries from every tradition have been telling us .
It &apos;s an old idea .
More than 2,000 years ago , the Stoics were reminding us it &apos;s not our experience that makes our lives , it &apos;s what we do with it .
Imagine a hurricane suddenly sweeps through your town and reduces every last thing to rubble .
One man is traumatized for life .
But another , maybe even his brother , almost feels liberated , and decides this is a great chance to start his life anew .
It &apos;s exactly the same event , but radically different responses .
There is nothing either good or bad , as Shakespeare told us in &quot; &quot; Hamlet , &quot; &quot; but thinking makes it so .
And this has certainly been my experience as a traveler .
Twenty-four years ago I took the most mind-bending trip across North Korea .
But the trip lasted a few days .
What I &apos;ve done with it sitting still , going back to it in my head , trying to understand it , finding a place for it in my thinking , that &apos;s lasted 24 years already and will probably last a lifetime .
The trip , in other words , gave me some amazing sights , but it &apos;s only sitting still that allows me to turn those into lasting insights .
And I sometimes think that so much of our life takes place inside our heads , in memory or imagination or interpretation or speculation , that if I really want to change my life I might best begin by changing my mind .
Again , none of this is new ; that &apos;s why Shakespeare and the Stoics were telling us this centuries ago , but Shakespeare never had to face 200 emails in a day .
( Laughter ) The Stoics , as far as I know , were not on Facebook .
We all know that in our on-demand lives , one of the things that &apos;s most on demand is ourselves .
Wherever we are , any time of night or day , our bosses , junk-mailers , our parents can get to us .
Sociologists have actually found that in recent years Americans are working fewer hours than 50 years ago , but we feel as if we &apos;re working more .
We have more and more time-saving devices , but sometimes , it seems , less and less time .
We can more and more easily make contact with people on the furthest corners of the planet , but sometimes in that process we lose contact with ourselves .
And one of my biggest surprises as a traveler has been to find that often it &apos;s exactly the people who have most enabled us to get anywhere who are intent on going nowhere .
In other words , precisely those beings who have created the technologies that override so many of the limits of old , are the ones wisest about the need for limits , even when it comes to technology .
I once went to the Google headquarters and I saw all the things many of you have heard about ; the indoor tree houses , the trampolines , workers at that time enjoying 20 percent of their paid time free so that they could just let their imaginations go wandering .
But what impressed me even more was that as I was waiting for my digital I.D. , one Googler was telling me about the program that he was about to start to teach the many , many Googlers who practice yoga to become trainers in it , and the other Googler was telling me about the book that he was about to write on the inner search engine , and the ways in which science has empirically shown that sitting still , or meditation , can lead not just to better health or to clearer thinking , but even to emotional intelligence .
I have another friend in Silicon Valley who is really one of the most eloquent spokesmen for the latest technologies , and in fact was one of the founders of Wired magazine , Kevin Kelly .
And Kevin wrote his last book on fresh technologies without a smartphone or a laptop or a TV in his home .
And like many in Silicon Valley , he tries really hard to observe what they call an Internet sabbath , whereby for 24 or 48 hours every week they go completely offline in order to gather the sense of direction and proportion they &apos;ll need when they go online again .
The one thing perhaps that technology hasn &apos;t always given us is a sense of how to make the wisest use of technology .
And when you speak of the sabbath , look at the Ten Commandments — there &apos;s only one word there for which the adjective &quot; &quot; holy &quot; &quot; is used , and that &apos;s the Sabbath .
I pick up the Jewish holy book of the Torah — its longest chapter , it &apos;s on the Sabbath .
And we all know that it &apos;s really one of our greatest luxuries , the empty space .
In many a piece of music , it &apos;s the pause or the rest that gives the piece its beauty and its shape .
And I know I as a writer will often try to include a lot of empty space on the page so that the reader can complete my thoughts and sentences and so that her imagination has room to breathe .
Now , in the physical domain , of course , many people , if they have the resources , will try to get a place in the country , a second home .
I &apos;ve never begun to have those resources , but I sometimes remember that any time I want , I can get a second home in time , if not in space , just by taking a day off .
And it &apos;s never easy because , of course , whenever I do I spend much of it worried about all the extra stuff that &apos;s going to crash down on me the following day .
I sometimes think I &apos;d rather give up meat or sex or wine than the chance to check on my emails .
( Laughter ) And every season I do try to take three days off on retreat but a part of me still feels guilty to be leaving my poor wife behind and to be ignoring all those seemingly urgent emails from my bosses and maybe to be missing a friend &apos;s birthday party .
But as soon as I get to a place of real quiet , I realize that it &apos;s only by going there that I &apos;ll have anything fresh or creative or joyful to share with my wife or bosses or friends .
Otherwise , really , I &apos;m just foisting on them my exhaustion or my distractedness , which is no blessing at all .
And so when I was 29 , I decided to remake my entire life in the light of going nowhere .
One evening I was coming back from the office , it was after midnight , I was in a taxi driving through Times Square , and I suddenly realized that I was racing around so much I could never catch up with my life .
And my life then , as it happened , was pretty much the one I might have dreamed of as a little boy .
I had really interesting friends and colleagues , I had a nice apartment on Park Avenue and 20th Street .
I had , to me , a fascinating job writing about world affairs , but I could never separate myself enough from them to hear myself think — or really , to understand if I was truly happy .
And so , I abandoned my dream life for a single room on the backstreets of Kyoto , Japan , which was the place that had long exerted a strong , really mysterious gravitational pull on me .
Even as a child I would just look at a painting of Kyoto and feel I recognized it ; I knew it before I ever laid eyes on it .
But it &apos;s also , as you all know , a beautiful city encircled by hills , filled with more than 2,000 temples and shrines , where people have been sitting still for 800 years or more .
And quite soon after I moved there , I ended up where I still am with my wife , formerly our kids , in a two-room apartment in the middle of nowhere where we have no bicycle , no car , no TV I can understand , and I still have to support my loved ones as a travel writer and a journalist , so clearly this is not ideal for job advancement or for cultural excitement or for social diversion .
But I realized that it gives me what I prize most , which is days and hours .
I have never once had to use a cell phone there .
I almost never have to look at the time , and every morning when I wake up , really the day stretches in front of me like an open meadow .
And when life throws up one of its nasty surprises , as it will , more than once , when a doctor comes into my room wearing a grave expression , or a car suddenly veers in front of mine on the freeway , I know , in my bones , that it &apos;s the time I &apos;ve spent going nowhere that is going to sustain me much more than all the time I &apos;ve spent racing around to Bhutan or Easter Island .
I &apos;ll always be a traveler — my livelihood depends on it — but one of the beauties of travel is that it allows you to bring stillness into the motion and the commotion of the world .
I once got on a plane in Frankfurt , Germany , and a young German woman came down and sat next to me and engaged me in a very friendly conversation for about 30 minutes , and then she just turned around and sat still for 12 hours .
She didn &apos;t once turn on her video monitor , she never pulled out a book , she didn &apos;t even go to sleep , she just sat still , and something of her clarity and calm really imparted itself to me .
I &apos;ve noticed more and more people taking conscious measures these days to try to open up a space inside their lives .
Some people go to black-hole resorts where they &apos;ll spend hundreds of dollars a night in order to hand over their cell phone and their laptop to the front desk on arrival .
Some people I know , just before they go to sleep , instead of scrolling through their messages or checking out YouTube , just turn out the lights and listen to some music , and notice that they sleep much better and wake up much refreshed .
I was once fortunate enough to drive into the high , dark mountains behind Los Angeles , where the great poet and singer and international heartthrob Leonard Cohen was living and working for many years as a full-time monk in the Mount Baldy Zen Center .
And I wasn &apos;t entirely surprised when the record that he released at the age of 77 , to which he gave the deliberately unsexy title of &quot; &quot; Old Ideas , &quot; &quot; went to number one in the charts in 17 nations in the world , hit the top five in nine others .
Something in us , I think , is crying out for the sense of intimacy and depth that we get from people like that .
who take the time and trouble to sit still .
And I think many of us have the sensation , I certainly do , that we &apos;re standing about two inches away from a huge screen , and it &apos;s noisy and it &apos;s crowded and it &apos;s changing with every second , and that screen is our lives .
And it &apos;s only by stepping back , and then further back , and holding still , that we can begin to see what the canvas means and to catch the larger picture .
And a few people do that for us by going nowhere .
So , in an age of acceleration , nothing can be more exhilarating than going slow .
And in an age of distraction , nothing is so luxurious as paying attention .
And in an age of constant movement , nothing is so urgent as sitting still .
So you can go on your next vacation to Paris or Hawaii , or New Orleans ; I bet you &apos;ll have a wonderful time .
But , if you want to come back home alive and full of fresh hope , in love with the world , I think you might want to try considering going nowhere .
Thank you .

I am a neuroscientist with a mixed background in physics and medicine .
My lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology focuses on spinal cord injury , which affects more than 50,000 people around the world every year , with dramatic consequences for affected individuals , whose life literally shatters in a matter of a handful of seconds .
And for me , the Man of Steel , Christopher Reeve , has best raised the awareness on the distress of spinal cord injured people .
And this is how I started my own personal journey in this field of research , working with the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation .
I still remember this decisive moment .
It was just at the end of a regular day of work with the foundation .
Chris addressed us , the scientists and experts , &quot; &quot; You have to be more pragmatic .
When leaving your laboratory tomorrow , I want you to stop by the rehabilitation center to watch injured people fighting to take a step , struggling to maintain their trunk .
And when you go home , think of what you are going to change in your research on the following day to make their lives better . &quot; &quot; These words , they stuck with me .
This was more than 10 years ago , but ever since , my laboratory has followed the pragmatic approach to recovery after spinal cord injury .
And my first step in this direction was to develop a new model of spinal cord injury that would more closely mimic some of the key features of human injury while offering well-controlled experimental conditions .
And for this purpose , we placed two hemisections on opposite sides of the body .
They completely interrupt the communication between the brain and the spinal cord , thus leading to complete and permanent paralysis of the leg .
But , as observed , after most injuries in humans , there is this intervening gap of intact neural tissue through which recovery can occur .
But how to make it happen ?
Well , the classical approach consists of applying intervention that would promote the growth of the severed fiber to the original target .
And while this certainly remained the key for a cure , this seemed extraordinarily complicated to me .
To reach clinical fruition rapidly , it was obvious : I had to think about the problem differently .
It turned out that more than 100 years of research on spinal cord physiology , starting with the Nobel Prize Sherrington , had shown that the spinal cord , below most injuries , contained all the necessary and sufficient neural networks to coordinate locomotion , but because input from the brain is interrupted , they are in a nonfunctional state , like kind of dormant .
My idea : We awaken this network .
And at the time , I was a post-doctoral fellow in Los Angeles , after completing my Ph.D. in France , where independent thinking is not necessarily promoted .
( Laughter ) I was afraid to talk to my new boss , but decided to muster up my courage .
I knocked at the door of my wonderful advisor , Reggie Edgerton , to share my new idea .
He listened to me carefully , and responded with a grin .
&quot; Why don &apos;t you try ? &quot;
And I promise to you , this was such an important moment in my career , when I realized that the great leader believed in young people and new ideas .
And this was the idea : I &apos;m going to use a simplistic metaphor to explain to you this complicated concept .
Imagine that the locomotor system is a car .
The engine is the spinal cord .
The transmission is interrupted . The engine is turned off .
How could we re-engage the engine ?
First , we have to provide the fuel ; second , press the accelerator pedal ; third , steer the car .
It turned out that there are known neural pathways coming from the brain that play this very function during locomotion .
My idea : Replace this missing input to provide the spinal cord with the kind of intervention that the brain would deliver naturally in order to walk .
For this , I leveraged 20 years of past research in neuroscience , first to replace the missing fuel with pharmacological agents that prepare the neurons in the spinal cord to fire , and second , to mimic the accelerator pedal with electrical stimulation .
So here imagine an electrode implanted on the back of the spinal cord to deliver painless stimulation .
It took many years , but eventually we developed an electrochemical neuroprosthesis that transformed the neural network in the spinal cord from dormant to a highly functional state .
Immediately , the paralyzed rat can stand .
As soon as the treadmill belt starts moving , the animal shows coordinated movement of the leg , but without the brain .
Here what I call &quot; &quot; the spinal brain &quot; &quot; cognitively processes sensory information arising from the moving leg and makes decisions as to how to activate the muscle in order to stand , to walk , to run , and even here , while sprinting , instantly stand if the treadmill stops moving .
This was amazing .
I was completely fascinated by this locomotion without the brain , but at the same time so frustrated .
This locomotion was completely involuntary .
The animal had virtually no control over the legs .
Clearly , the steering system was missing .
And it then became obvious from me that we had to move away from the classical rehabilitation paradigm , stepping on a treadmill , and develop conditions that would encourage the brain to begin voluntary control over the leg .
With this in mind , we developed a completely new robotic system to support the rat in any direction of space .
Imagine , this is really cool .
So imagine the little 200-gram rat attached at the extremity of this 200-kilo robot , but the rat does not feel the robot .
The robot is transparent , just like you would hold a young child during the first insecure steps .
Let me summarize : The rat received a paralyzing lesion of the spinal cord .
The electrochemical neuroprosthesis enabled a highly functional state of the spinal locomotor networks .
The robot provided the safe environment to allow the rat to attempt anything to engage the paralyzed legs .
And for motivation , we used what I think is the most powerful pharmacology of Switzerland : fine Swiss chocolate .
( Laughter ) Actually , the first results were very , very , very disappointing .
Here is my best physical therapist completely failing to encourage the rat to take a single step , whereas the same rat , five minutes earlier , walked beautifully on the treadmill .
We were so frustrated .
But you know , one of the most essential qualities of a scientist is perseverance .
We insisted . We refined our paradigm , and after several months of training , the otherwise paralyzed rat could stand , and whenever she decided , initiated full weight-bearing locomotion to sprint towards the rewards .
This is the first recovery ever observed of voluntary leg movement after an experimental lesion of the spinal cord leading to complete and permanent paralysis .
In fact — ( Applause ) Thank you .
In fact , not only could the rat initiate and sustain locomotion on the ground , they could even adjust leg movement , for example , to resist gravity in order to climb a staircase .
I can promise you this was such an emotional moment in my laboratory .
It took us 10 years of hard work to reach this goal .
But the remaining question was , how ?
I mean , how is it possible ?
And here , what we found was completely unexpected .
This novel training paradigm encouraged the brain to create new connections , some relay circuits that relay information from the brain past the injury and restore cortical control over the locomotor networks below the injury .
And here , you can see one such example , where we label the fibers coming from the brain in red .
This blue neuron is connected with the locomotor center , and what this constellation of synaptic contacts means is that the brain is reconnected with the locomotor center with only one relay neuron .
But the remodeling was not restricted to the lesion area .
It occurred throughout the central nervous system , including in the brain stem , where we observed up to 300-percent increase in the density of fibers coming from the brain .
We did not aim to repair the spinal cord , yet we were able to promote one of the more extensive remodeling of axonal projections ever observed in the central nervous system of adult mammal after an injury .
And there is a very important message hidden behind this discovery .
They are the result of a young team of very talented people : physical therapists , neurobiologists , neurosurgeons , engineers of all kinds , who have achieved together what would have been impossible by single individuals .
This is truly a trans-disciplinary team .
They are working so close to each other that there is horizontal transfer of DNA .
We are creating the next generation of M.D. &apos; s and engineers capable of translating discoveries all the way from bench to bedside .
And me ?
I am only the maestro who orchestrated this beautiful symphony .
Now , I am sure you are all wondering , aren &apos;t you , will this help injured people ?
Me too , every day .
The truth is that we don &apos;t know enough yet .
This is certainly not a cure for spinal cord injury , but I begin to believe that this may lead to an intervention to improve recovery and people &apos;s quality of life .
I would like you all to take a moment and dream with me .
Imagine a person just suffered a spinal cord injury .
After a few weeks of recovery , we will implant a programmable pump to deliver a personalized pharmacological cocktail directly to the spinal cord .
At the same time , we will implant an electrode array , a sort of second skin covering the area of the spinal cord controlling leg movement , and this array is attached to an electrical pulse generator that delivers stimulations that are tailored to the person &apos;s needs .
This defines a personalized electrochemical neuroprosthesis that will enable locomotion during training with a newly designed supporting system .
And my hope is that after several months of training , there may be enough remodeling of residual connection to allow locomotion without the robot , maybe even without pharmacology or stimulation .
My hope here is to be able to create the personalized condition to boost the plasticity of the brain and the spinal cord .
And this is a radically new concept that may apply to other neurological disorders , what I termed &quot; &quot; personalized neuroprosthetics , &quot; &quot; where by sensing and stimulating neural interfaces , I implanted throughout the nervous system , in the brain , in the spinal cord , even in peripheral nerves , based on patient-specific impairments .
But not to replace the lost function , no — to help the brain help itself .
And I hope this enticed your imagination , because I can promise to you this is not a matter of whether this revolution will occur , but when .
And remember , we are only as great as our imagination , as big as our dream .
Thank you .

I thought I &apos;d tell you a little about what I like to write .
And I like to immerse myself in my topics .
I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig .
And I see my life as a series of experiments .
So , I work for Esquire magazine , and a couple of years ago , I wrote an article called &quot; &quot; My Outsourced Life , &quot; &quot; where I hired a team of people in Bangalore , India , to live my life for me .
So , they answered my emails .
They answered my phone .
They argued with my wife for me , and they read my son bedtime stories .
It was the best month of my life , because I just sat back and I read books and watched movies .
It was a wonderful experience .
More recently , I wrote an article for Esquire called — about radical honesty .
And this is a movement where — this is started by a psychologist in Virginia , who says that you should never , ever lie , except maybe during poker and golf , his only exceptions .
And , more than that , whatever is on your brain should come out of your mouth .
So , I decided I would try this for a month .
This was the worst month of my life .
( Laughter ) I do not recommend this at all .
To give you a sense of the experience , the article was called , &quot; &quot; I Think You &apos;re Fat . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , that was hard .
My most recent book — my previous book was called &quot; &quot; The Know-It-All , &quot; &quot; and it was about the year I spent reading the Encyclopedia Britannica from A to Z in my quest to learn everything in the world , or more precisely from Aak , which is a type of East Asian music , all the way to Zwyiec , which is — well , I don &apos;t want to ruin the ending .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a very exciting twist ending , like an O. Henry novel , so I won &apos;t ruin it .
But I love that one , because that was an experiment about how much information one human brain could absorb .
Although , listening to Kevin Kelly , you don &apos;t have to remember anything .
You can just Google it .
So , I wasted some time there .
I love those experiments , but I think that the most profound and life-changing experiment that I &apos;ve done is my most recent experiment , where I spent a year trying to follow all of the rules of the Bible , &quot; The Year of Living Biblically . &quot;
And I undertook this for two reasons .
The first was that I grew up with no religion at all .
As I say in my book , I &apos;m Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian .
( Laughter ) So , not very .
But I &apos;ve become increasingly interested in religion .
I do think it &apos;s the defining issue of our time , or one of the main ones .
And I have a son . I want to know what to teach him .
So , I decided to dive in head first , and try to live the Bible .
The second reason I undertook this is because I &apos;m concerned about the rise of fundamentalism , religious fundamentalism , and people who say they take the Bible literally , which is , according to some polls , as high as 45 or 50 percent of America .
So I decided , what if you really did take the Bible literally ?
I decided to take it to its logical conclusion and take everything in the Bible literally , without picking and choosing .
The first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles .
I had Christian bibles .
I had Jewish bibles .
A friend of mine sent me something called a hip-hop bible , where the twenty-third Psalm is rendered as , &quot; &quot; The Lord is all that , &quot; &quot; as opposed to what I knew it as , &quot; &quot; The Lord is my shepherd . &quot; &quot; Then I went down and I read several versions , and I wrote down every single law that I could find .
And this was a very long list — over 700 rules .
And they range from the famous ones that I had heard of — The Ten Commandments , love your neighbor , be fruitful and multiply .
So I wanted to follow those .
And actually , I take my projects very seriously , because I had twins during my year , so I definitely take my projects seriously .
But I also wanted to follow the hundreds of arcane and obscure laws that are in the Bible .
There is the law in Leviticus , &quot; You cannot shave the corners of your beard . &quot;
I didn &apos;t know where my corners were , so I decided to let the whole thing grow , and this is what I looked like by the end .
As you can imagine , I spent a lot of time at airport security .
( Laughter ) My wife wouldn &apos;t kiss me for the last two months .
So , certainly the challenge was there .
The Bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers , so I thought , &quot; &quot; Sounds strange , but I &apos;ll try it . &quot; &quot; You only know if you try it .
I got rid of all my poly-cotton T-shirts .
The Bible says that if two men are in a fight , and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man , then her hand shall be cut off .
So , I wanted to follow that rule .
( Laughter ) That one I followed by default , by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby , looking like she had a strong grip . ( Laughter )
So — oh , there &apos;s another shot of my beard .
I will say it was an amazing year because it really was life changing , and incredibly challenging .
And there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging .
The first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day .
You know , I could spend a year not killing , but spending a year not gossiping , not coveting , not lying — you know , I live in New York , and I work as a journalist , so this was 75 , 80 percent of my day I had to do it .
But it was really interesting , because I was able to make some progress , because I couldn &apos;t believe how much my behavior changed my thoughts .
This was one of the huge lessons of the year , is that I almost pretended to be a better person , and I became a little bit of a better person .
So I had always thought , you know , &quot; &quot; You change your mind , and you change your behavior , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s often the other way around .
You change your behavior , and you change your mind .
So , you know , if you want to become more compassionate , you visit sick people in the hospital , and you will become more compassionate .
You donate money to a cause , and you become emotionally involved in that cause .
So , it really was cognitive psychology — you know , cognitive dissonance — that I was experiencing .
The Bible actually talks about cognitive psychology , very primitive cognitive psychology .
In the Proverbs , it says that if you smile , you will become happier , which , as we know , is actually true .
The second type of rule that was difficult to obey was the rules that will get you into a little trouble in twenty-first-century America .
And perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers .
( Laughter ) But it &apos;s a big part of the Bible , so I figured I had to address it .
So , I was able to stone one adulterer .
It happened — I was in the park , and I was dressed in my biblical clothing , so sandals and sort of a white robe , you know , because again , the outer affects the inner .
I wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind .
And this man came up to me and he said , &quot; Why are you dressed like that ? &quot;
And I explained my project , and he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I am an adulterer , are you going to stone me ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , that would be great ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I actually took out a handful of stones from my pocket that I had been carrying around for weeks , hoping for just this interaction — and , you know , they were pebbles — but he grabbed them out of my hand .
He was actually an elderly man , mid-70s , just so you know .
But he &apos;s still an adulterer , and still quite angry .
He grabbed them out of my hand and threw them at my face , and I felt that I could — eye for an eye — I could retaliate , and throw one back at him .
So that was my experience stoning , and it did allow me to talk about , in a more serious way , these big issues .
How can the Bible be so barbaric in some places , and yet so incredibly wise in others ?
How should we view the Bible ?
Should we view it , you know , as original intent , like a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible ?
How was the Bible written ?
And actually , since this is a tech crowd , I talk in the book about how the Bible actually reminds me of the Wikipedia , because it has all of these authors and editors over hundreds of years .
And it &apos;s sort of evolved .
It &apos;s not a book that was written and came down from on high .
So I thought I would end by telling you just a couple of the take-aways , the bigger lessons that I learned from my year .
The first is , thou shalt not take the Bible literally .
This became very , very clear , early on .
Because if you do , then you end up acting like a crazy person , and stoning adulterers , or — here &apos;s another example .
Well , that &apos;s another . I did spend some time shepherding .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a very relaxing vocation . I recommend it .
But this one is — the Bible says that you cannot touch women during certain times of the month , and more than that , you cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat .
And my wife thought this was very offensive , so she sat in every seat in our apartment , and I had to spend much of the year standing until I bought my own seat and carried it around .
So , you know , I met with creationists .
I went to the creationists &apos; museum .
And these are the ultimate literalists .
And it was fascinating , because they were not stupid people at all .
I would wager that their IQ is exactly the same as the average evolutionist .
It &apos;s just that their faith is so strong in this literal interpretation of the Bible that they distort all the data to fit their model .
And they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this .
And I will say , though , the museum is gorgeous .
They really did a fantastic job .
If you &apos;re ever in Kentucky , there &apos;s , you can see a movie of the flood , and they have sprinklers in the ceiling that will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes .
So , whatever you think of creationism — and I think it &apos;s crazy — they did a great job .
( Laughter ) Another lesson is that thou shalt give thanks .
And this one was a big lesson because I was praying , giving these prayers of thanksgiving , which was odd for an agnostic .
But I was saying thanks all the time , every day , and I started to change my perspective .
And I started to realize the hundreds of little things that go right every day , that I didn &apos;t even notice , that I took for granted , as opposed to focusing on the three or four that went wrong .
So , this is actually a key to happiness for me , is to just remember when I came over here , the car didn &apos;t flip over , and I didn &apos;t trip coming up the stairs .
It &apos;s a remarkable thing .
Third , that thou shall have reverence .
This one was unexpected because I started the year as an agnostic , and by the end of the year , I became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic , which I love .
And I &apos;m trying to start it as a movement .
So , if anyone wants to join , the basic idea is , whether or not there is a God , there &apos;s something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness , and that our rituals can be sacred .
The Sabbath can be sacred .
This was one of the great things about my year , doing the Sabbath , because I am a workaholic , so having this one day where you cannot work , it really , that changed my life .
So , this idea of sacredness , whether or not there is a God .
Thou shall not stereotype .
This one happened because I spent a lot of time with various religious communities throughout America because I wanted it to be more than about my journey .
I wanted it to be about religion in America .
So , I spent time with evangelical Christians , and Hasidic Jews , and the Amish .
I &apos;m very proud because I think I &apos;m the only person in America to out Bible-talk a Jehovah &apos;s Witness .
( Laughter ) After three and a half hours , he looked at his watch , he &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I gotta go . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Oh , thank you very much .
Thank you . Bless you , bless you .
But it was interesting because I had some very preconceived notions about , for instance , evangelical Christianity , and I found that it &apos;s such a wide and varied movement that it is difficult to make generalizations about it .
There &apos;s a group I met with called the Red Letter Christians , and they focus on the red words in the Bible , which are the ones that Jesus spoke .
That &apos;s how they printed them in the old Bibles .
And their argument is that Jesus never talked about homosexuality .
They have a pamphlet that says , &quot; Here &apos;s what Jesus said about homosexuality , &quot; and you open it up , and there &apos;s nothing in it .
So , they say Jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts , helping poor people .
So , this was very inspiring to me .
I recommend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo .
They &apos;re very inspiring leaders , even though I disagree with much of what they say .
Also , thou shalt not disregard the irrational .
This one was very unexpected because , you know , I grew up with the scientific worldview , and I was shocked learning how much of my life is governed by irrational forces .
And the thing is , if they &apos;re not harmful , they &apos;re not to be completely dismissed .
Because I learned that — I was thinking , I was doing all these rituals , these biblical rituals , separating my wool and linen , and I would ask these religious people &quot; Why would the Bible possibly tell us to do this ? Why would God care ? &quot;
And they said , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s just rituals that give us meaning . &quot; &quot; And I would say , &quot; &quot; But that &apos;s crazy . &quot; &quot; And they would say , &quot; &quot; Well , what about you ?
You blow out candles on top of a birthday cake .
If a guy from Mars came down and saw , here &apos;s one guy blowing out the fire on top of a cake versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics , would the Martians say , &apos; Well , that guy , he makes sense , but that guy &apos;s crazy ? &apos; &quot; &quot; So no , I think that rituals are , by nature , irrational .
So the key is to choose the right rituals , the ones that are not harmful — but rituals by themselves are not to be dismissed .
And finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose .
And this one I learned because I tried to follow everything in the Bible .
And I failed miserably .
Because you can &apos;t .
You have to pick and choose . And anyone who follows the Bible is going to be picking and choosing .
The key is to pick and choose the right parts .
There &apos;s the phrase called cafeteria religion , and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way , and they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s just cafeteria religion .
You &apos;re just picking and choosing . &quot; &quot; But my argument is , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s wrong with cafeterias ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve had some great meals at cafeterias .
I &apos;ve also had some meals that make me want to dry heave .
So , it &apos;s about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion , about tolerance , about loving your neighbor , as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin , or intolerance , or violence , which are very much in the Bible as well .
So if we are to find any meaning in this book , then we have to really engage it , and wrestle with it .
And I thought I &apos;d end with just a couple more .
There &apos;s me reading the Bible .
That &apos;s how I hailed taxicabs .
( Laughter ) Seriously , and it worked . And yes , that was actually a rented sheep , so I had to return that in the morning , but it served well for a day .
So , anyway , thank you so much for letting me speak .
Please close your eyes , and open your hands .
Now imagine what you could place in your hands : an apple , maybe your wallet .
Now open your eyes .
What about a life ?
What you see here is a premature baby .
He looks like he &apos;s resting peacefully , but in fact he &apos;s struggling to stay alive because he can &apos;t regulate his own body temperature .
This baby is so tiny he doesn &apos;t have enough fat on his body to stay warm .
Sadly , 20 million babies like this are born every year around the world .
Four million of these babies die annually .
But the bigger problem is that the ones who do survive grow up with severe , long-term health problems .
The reason is because in the first month of a baby &apos;s life , its only job is to grow .
If it &apos;s battling hypothermia , its organs can &apos;t develop normally , resulting in a range of health problems from diabetes , to heart disease , to low I.Q.
Imagine : Many of these problems could be prevented if these babies were just kept warm .
That is the primary function of an incubator .
But traditional incubators require electricity and cost up to 20 thousand dollars .
So , you &apos;re not going to find them in rural areas of developing countries .
As a result , parents resort to local solutions like tying hot water bottles around their babies &apos; bodies , or placing them under light bulbs like the ones you see here — methods that are both ineffective and unsafe .
I &apos;ve seen this firsthand over and over again .
On one of my first trips to India , I met this young woman , Sevitha , who had just given birth to a tiny premature baby , Rani .
She took her baby to the nearest village clinic , and the doctor advised her to take Rani to a city hospital so she could be placed in an incubator .
But that hospital was over four hours away , and Sevitha didn &apos;t have the means to get there , so her baby died .
Inspired by this story , and dozens of other similar stories like this , my team and I realized what was needed was a local solution , something that could work without electricity , that was simple enough for a mother or a midwife to use , given that the majority of births still take place in the home .
We needed something that was portable , something that could be sterilized and reused across multiple babies and something ultra-low-cost , compared to the 20,000 dollars that an incubator in the U.S. costs .
So , this is what we came up with .
What you see here looks nothing like an incubator .
It looks like a small sleeping bag for a baby .
You can open it up completely . It &apos;s waterproof .
There &apos;s no seams inside so you can sterilize it very easily .
But the magic is in this pouch of wax .
This is a phase-change material .
It &apos;s a wax-like substance with a melting point of human body temperature , 37 degrees Celsius .
You can melt this simply using hot water and then when it melts it &apos;s able to maintain one constant temperature for four to six hours at a time , after which you simply reheat the pouch .
So , you then place it into this little pocket back here , and it creates a warm micro-environment for the baby .
Looks simple , but we &apos;ve reiterated this dozens of times by going into the field to talk to doctors , moms and clinicians to ensure that this really meets the needs of the local communities .
We plan to launch this product in India in 2010 , and the target price point will be 25 dollars , less than 0.1 percent of the cost of a traditional incubator .
Over the next five years we hope to save the lives of almost a million babies .
But the longer-term social impact is a reduction in population growth .
This seems counterintuitive , but turns out that as infant mortality is reduced , population sizes also decrease , because parents don &apos;t need to anticipate that their babies are going to die .
We hope that the Embrace infant warmer and other simple innovations like this represent a new trend for the future of technology : simple , localized , affordable solutions that have the potential to make huge social impact .
In designing this we followed a few basic principles .
We really tried to understand the end user , in this case , people like Sevitha .
We tried to understand the root of the problem rather than being biased by what already exists .
And then we thought of the most simple solution we could to address this problem .
In doing this , I believe we can truly bring technology to the masses .
And we can save millions of lives through the simple warmth of an Embrace .
I went to Spain a few months ago and I had the best foie gras of my life .
The best culinary experience of my life .
Because what I saw , I &apos;m convinced , is the future of cooking .
Ridiculous , right ?
Foie gras and the future of cooking .
There &apos;s not a food today that &apos;s more maligned than foie gras , right ?
I mean , it &apos;s crucified .
It was outlawed in Chicago for a while .
It &apos;s pending here in California , and just recently in New York .
It &apos;s like if you &apos;re a chef and you put it on your menu , you risk being attacked .
Really , it happened here in San Francisco to a famous chef .
I &apos;m not saying that there &apos;s not a rationale for being opposed to foie gras .
The reasons usually just boil down to the gavage , which is the force feeding .
Basically you take a goose or a duck and you force feed a ton of grain down its throat .
More grain in a couple of weeks than it would ever get in a lifetime .
Its liver expands by eight times .
Suffice to say it &apos;s like — it &apos;s not the prettiest picture of sustainable farming .
The problem for us chefs is that it &apos;s so freakin &apos; delicious .
( Laughter ) I mean , I love the stuff .
It is fatty , it &apos;s sweet , it &apos;s silky , it &apos;s unctuous .
It makes everything else you put it with taste incredible .
Can we produce a menu that &apos;s delicious without foie gras ?
Yes , sure .
You can also bike the Tour de France without steroids , right ?
( Laughter ) Not a lot of people are doing it .
And for good reason .
( Laughter ) So several months ago , a friend of mine sent me this link to this guy , Eduardo Sousa .
Eduardo is doing what he calls natural foie gras .
Natural foie gras .
What &apos;s natural about foie gras ?
To take advantage of when the temperature drops in the fall , geese and ducks gorge on food to prepare for the harsh realities of winter .
And the rest of the year they &apos;re free to roam around Eduardo &apos;s land and eat what they want .
So no gavage , no force feeding , no factory-like conditions , no cruelty .
And it &apos;s shockingly not a new idea .
His great-granddad started — Patería de Sousa — in 1812 .
And they &apos;ve been doing it quietly ever since .
That is until last year , when Eduardo won the Coup de Coeur , the coveted French gastronomic prize .
It &apos;s like the Olympics of food products .
He placed first for his foie gras .
Big , big problem .
As he said to me , that really pissed the French off .
( Laughter ) He said it sort of gleefully .
It was all over the papers .
I read about it . It was in Le Monde .
&quot; &quot; Spanish chef accused ... &quot; &quot; — and the French accused him .
&quot; Spanish chef accused of cheating . &quot;
They accused him of paying off the judges .
They implicated actually , the Spanish government , amazingly .
Huh , amazing .
A huge scandal for a few weeks .
Couldn &apos;t find a shred of evidence .
Now , look at the guy .
He doesn &apos;t look like a guy who &apos;s paying off French judges for his foie gras .
So that died down , and very soon afterward , new controversy .
He shouldn &apos;t win because it &apos;s not foie gras .
It &apos;s not foie gras because it &apos;s not gavage .
There &apos;s no force feeding .
So by definition , he &apos;s lying and should be disqualified .
As funny as it sounds , articulating it now and reading about it — actually , if we had talked about it before this controversy , I would have said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s kind of true . &quot; &quot; You know , foie gras by definition , force feeding , it &apos;s gavage , and that &apos;s what you get when you want foie gras .
That is , until I went to Eduardo &apos;s farm in Extremadura , 50 miles north of Seville , right on the Portugal border .
I saw first-hand a system that is incredibly complex and then at the same time , like everything beautiful in nature , is utterly simple .
And he said to me , really from the first moment , my life &apos;s work is to give the geese what they want .
He repeated that about 50 times in the two days I was with him .
I &apos;m just here to give the geese what they want .
Actually , when I showed up he was lying down with the geese with his cell phone taking pictures of them like his children in the grass .
Amazing .
He &apos;s really just in love with — he &apos;s at one with — he &apos;s the goose whisperer .
( Laughter ) And when I was speaking to him , you know , I thought , like I &apos;m speaking to you now , right , but sort of in the middle of my questions , my excited questions , because the more I got to know him and his system , the more exciting this whole idea became .
He kept going like this to me .
And I thought , OK , excited Jew from New York , right ?
I &apos;m talking a little too aggressively , whatever , so you know , I slowed down .
And finally , by the end of the day I was like , Ed-uar-do , you know like this ?
But he was still going like this .
I figured it out .
I was speaking too loudly .
So I hushed my voice .
I kind of like asked these questions and chatted with him through a translator in kind of a half whisper .
And he stopped doing this .
And amazingly , the geese who were on the other side of the paddock when I was around — &quot; &quot; Get the hell away from this kid ! &quot; &quot; — when I lowered my voice , they all came right up to us .
Right up to us , like right up to here .
Right along the fence line .
And fence line was amazing in itself .
The fence — like this conception of fence that we have it &apos;s totally backward with him .
The electricity on this fiberglass fence is only on the outside .
He rewired it . He invented it .
I &apos;ve never seen it . Have you ?
You fence in animals . You electrify the inside .
He doesn &apos;t .
He electrifies only the outside .
Why ?
Because he said to me that he felt like the geese — and he proved this actually , not just a conceit , he proved this — the geese felt manipulated when they were imprisoned in their little paddocks .
Even though they were imprisoned in this Garden of Eden with figs and everything else .
He felt like they felt manipulated .
So he got rid of the electricity , he got rid of current on the inside and kept it on the outside , so it would protect them against coyotes and other predators .
Now , what happened ?
They ate , and he showed me on a chart , how they ate about 20 percent more feed to feed their livers .
The landscape is incredible .
I mean , his farm is incredible .
It really is the Garden of Eden .
There &apos;s figs and everything else there for the taking .
And the irony of ironies is because Extremadura , the area — what does Extremadura mean ?
Extra hard land , right ?
Extra difficult . Extra hard .
But over four generations , he and his family have literally transformed this extra hard land into a tasting menu .
Upgrades the life for these geese .
And they are allowed to take whatever they want .
Another irony , the double irony is that on the figs and the olives , Eduardo can make more money selling those than he can on the foie gras .
He doesn &apos;t care .
He lets them take what they want and he says , &quot; Usually , it &apos;s about 50 percent . They &apos;re very fair . &quot;
The other 50 percent , he takes and he sells and he makes money on them .
Part of the income for his farm .
A big part of his income for his farm .
But he never controls it .
They get what they want , they leave the rest for me and I sell it .
His biggest obstacle , really , was the marketplace , which demands these days bright yellow foie gras .
That &apos;s how I &apos;ve been trained .
You want to look and see what good foie gras is , it &apos;s got to be bright yellow .
It &apos;s the indication that it &apos;s the best foie gras .
Well , because he doesn &apos;t force feed , because he doesn &apos;t gavage tons of corn , his livers were pretty grey .
Or they were .
But he found this wild plant called the Lupin bush .
The Lupin bush , it &apos;s all around Extremadura .
He let it go to seed , he took the seeds , he planted it on his 30 acres , all around .
And the geese love the Lupin bush .
Not for the bush , but for the seeds .
And when they eat the seeds , their foie gras turns yellow .
Radioactive yellow .
Bright yellow .
Of the highest quality foie gras yellow I &apos;ve ever seen .
( Laughter ) So I &apos;m listening to all this , you know , and I &apos;m like , is this guy for real ? Is he making some of this up ?
Is he like , you know — because he seemed to have an answer for everything , and it was always nature .
It was never him .
And I was like , you know , I always get a little , like , weirded out by people who deflect everything away from themselves .
Because , really , they want you to look at themselves , right ?
But he deflected everything away from his ingenuity into working with his landscape .
So it &apos;s like , here I am , I &apos;m on the fence about this guy , but increasingly , eating up his every word .
And we &apos;re sitting there , and I hear &#91; clapping &#93; from a distance , so I look over .
And he grabs my arm and the translator &apos;s , and ducks us under a bush and says , &quot; &quot; Watch this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shush , &quot; &quot; he says again for the 500th time to me .
&quot; Shush , watch this . &quot;
And this squadron of geese come over .
&#91; Clapping &#93; And they &apos;re getting louder , louder , louder , like really loud , right over us .
And like airport traffic control , as they start to go past us they &apos;re called back — and they &apos;re called back and back and back .
And then they circle around .
And his geese are calling up now to the wild geese .
&#91; Clapping &#93; And the wild geese are calling down . &#91; Clapping &#93;
And it &apos;s getting louder and louder and they circle and circle and they land .
And I &apos;m just saying , &quot; &quot; No way . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) No way .
And I look at Eduardo , who &apos;s near tears looking at this , and I say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re telling me that your geese are calling to the wild geese to say come for a visit ? &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; No , no , no .
They &apos;ve come to stay . &quot; &quot; They &apos;ve come to stay ?
( Laughter ) It &apos;s like the DNA of a goose is to fly south in the winter , right ?
I said that . I said &quot; &quot; Isn &apos;t that what they &apos;re put on this Earth for ?
To fly south in the winter and north when it gets warm ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no .
Their DNA is to find the conditions that are conducive to life .
To happiness .
They find it here .
They don &apos;t need anything more . &quot; &quot; They stop . They mate with his domesticated geese , and his flock continues .
Think about that for a minute .
It &apos;s brilliant , right ?
Imagine — I don &apos;t know , imagine a hog farm in , like , North Carolina , and a wild pig comes upon a factory farm and decides to stay .
( Laughter ) So how did it taste ?
I finally got to taste it before I left .
He took me to his neighborhood restaurant and he served me some of his foie gras , confit de foie gras .
It was incredible .
And the problem with saying that , of course , is that you know , at this point it risks hyperbole really easily .
And I &apos;d like to make a metaphor , but I don &apos;t have one really .
I was drinking this guy &apos;s Kool-Aid so much , he could have served me goose feathers and I would have been like , this guy &apos;s a genius , you know ?
I &apos;m really in love with him at this point .
But it truly was the best foie gras of my life .
So much so that I don &apos;t think I had ever really had foie gras until that moment .
I &apos;d had something that was called foie gras .
But this was transformative . Really transformative .
And I say to you , I might not stick to this , but I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll ever serve foie gras on my menu again because of that taste experience with Eduardo .
It was sweet , it was unctuous .
It had all the qualities of foie gras , but its fat had a lot of integrity and a lot of honesty .
And you could taste herbs , you could taste spices .
And I kept — I said , you know , I swear to God I tasted star anise .
I was sure of it .
And I &apos;m not like some super taster , you know ?
But I can taste things .
There &apos;s 100 percent star anise in there .
And he says , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I ended up like going down the spices , and finally , it was like , OK , salt and pepper , thinking he &apos;s salted and peppered his liver .
But no .
He takes the liver when he harvests the foie gras , he sticks them in this jar and he confits it .
No salt , no pepper , no oil , no spices .
What ?
We went back out for the final tour of the farm , and he showed me the wild pepper plants and the plants that he made sure existed on his farm for salinity .
He doesn &apos;t need salt and pepper .
And he doesn &apos;t need spices , because he &apos;s got this potpourri of herbs and flavors that his geese love to gorge on .
I turned to him at the end of the meal , and it &apos;s a question I asked several times , and he hadn &apos;t , kind of , answered me directly , but I said , &quot; &quot; Now look , you &apos;re in Spain , some of the greatest chefs in the world are — Ferran Adria , the preeminent chef of the world today , not that far from you .
How come you don &apos;t give him this ?
How come no one &apos;s really heard of you ? &quot; &quot; And it may be because of the wine , or it may be because of my excitement , he answered me directly and he said , &quot; &quot; Because chefs don &apos;t deserve my foie gras . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he was right .
He was right .
Chefs take foie gras and they make it their own .
They create a dish where all the vectors point at us .
With Eduardo it &apos;s about the expression of nature .
And as he said , I think fittingly , it &apos;s a gift from God , with God saying , you &apos;ve done good work .
Simple .
I flew home , I &apos;m on the flight with my little black book and I took , you know , pages and pages of notes about it .
I really was moved .
And in the corner of one of these — one of my notes , is this note that says , when asked , what do you think of conventional foie gras ?
What do you think of foie gras that 99.99999 percent of the world eats ?
He said , &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s an insult to history . &quot; &quot; And I wrote , insult to history .
I &apos;m on the plane and I &apos;m just tearing my hair out .
It &apos;s like , why didn &apos;t I follow up on that ?
What the hell does that mean ?
Insult to history .
So I did some research when I got back , and here &apos;s what I found .
The history of foie gras .
Jews invented foie gras .
True story . True story .
By accident . They were looking for an alternative to schmaltz . Gotten sick of the chicken fat . They were looking for an alternative . And they saw in the fall that there was this natural ,
beautiful , sweet , delicious fat from geese .
And they slaughtered them , used the fat throughout the winter for cooking .
The Pharaoh got wind of this — This is true , right off the Internet .
The Pharaoh got — ( Laughter ) I swear to God . ( Laughter )
The Pharaoh got wind of this and wanted to taste it .
He tasted it and fell in love with it .
He started demanding it .
And he didn &apos;t want it just in the fall , he wanted it all year round .
And he demanded that the Jews supply enough for everyone .
And the Jews , fearing for their life , had to come up with an ingenious idea , or at least try and satisfy the Pharaoh &apos;s wishes , of course .
And they invented , what ? Gavage .
They invented gavage in a great moment of fear for their lives , and they provided the Pharaoh with gavage liver , and the good stuff they kept for themselves .
Supposedly , anyway . I believe that one .
That &apos;s the history of foie gras .
And if you think about it , it &apos;s the history of industrial agriculture .
It &apos;s the history of what we eat today .
Most of what we eat today .
Mega-farms , feed lots , chemical amendments , long-distance travel , food processing .
All of it , our food system .
That &apos;s also an insult to history .
It &apos;s an insult to the basic laws of nature and of biology .
Whether we &apos;re talking about beef cattle or we &apos;re talking about chickens , or we &apos;re talking about broccoli or Brussels sprouts , or in the case of this morning &apos;s New York Times , catfish — which wholesale are going out of business .
Whatever it is , it &apos;s a mindset that is reminiscent of General Motors .
It &apos;s rooted in extraction .
Take more , sell more , waste more .
And for the future it won &apos;t serve us .
Jonas Salk has a great quote .
He said , &quot; &quot; If all the insects disappeared , life on Earth as we know it would disappear within 50 years .
If human beings disappeared , life on Earth as we know it would flourish . &quot; &quot; And he &apos;s right .
We need now to adopt a new conception of agriculture .
Really new .
One in which we stop treating the planet as if it were some kind of business in liquidation .
And stop degrading resources under the guise of cheap food .
We can start by looking to farmers like Eduardo .
Farmers that rely on nature for solutions , for answers , rather than imposing solutions on nature .
Listening as Janine Benyus , one of my favorite writers and thinkers about this topic says , &quot; Listening to nature &apos;s operating instructions . &quot;
That &apos;s what Eduardo does , and does so brilliantly .
And what he showed me and what he can show all of us , I think , is that the great thing for chefs , the great blessing for chefs , and for people that care about food and cooking , is that the most ecological choice for food is also the most ethical choice for food .
Whether we &apos;re talking about Brussels sprouts or foie gras .
And it &apos;s also almost always , and I haven &apos;t found an example otherwise , but almost always , the most delicious choice .
That &apos;s serendipitous .
Thank you .

You can see Hillary Clinton on the right .
The Times was deluged with criticism .
As reporters , we research , we interview .
We also have our own unconscious biases .
Putting them there made them more recognizable .
Suggest female sources to reporters and editors .
Meet Tony . He &apos;s my student .
He &apos;s about my age , and he &apos;s in San Quentin State Prison .
When Tony was 16 years old , one day , one moment , &quot; &quot; It was mom &apos;s gun .
Just flash it , scare the guy . He &apos;s a punk .
He took some money ; we &apos;ll take his money . That &apos;ll teach him .
Then last minute , I &apos;m thinking , &apos; Can &apos;t do this . This is wrong . &apos; My buddy says , &apos; C &apos;mon , let &apos;s do this . &apos; I say , &apos; Let &apos;s do this . &apos; &quot; &quot; And those three words , Tony &apos;s going to remember , because the next thing he knows , he hears the pop .
There &apos;s the punk on the ground , puddle of blood .
And that &apos;s felony murder — 25 to life , parole at 50 if you &apos;re lucky , and Tony &apos;s not feeling very lucky .
So when we meet in my philosophy class in his prison and I say , &quot; &quot; In this class , we will discuss the foundations of ethics , &quot; &quot; Tony interrupts me .
&quot; &quot; What are you going to teach me about right and wrong ?
I know what is wrong . I have done wrong .
I am told every day , by every face I see , every wall I face , that I am wrong .
If I ever get out of here , there will always be a mark by my name .
I &apos;m a convict ; I am branded &apos; wrong . &apos; What are you going to tell me about right and wrong ? &quot; &quot; So I say to Tony , &quot; &quot; Sorry , but it &apos;s worse than you think .
You think you know right and wrong ?
Then can you tell me what wrong is ?
No , don &apos;t just give me an example .
I want to know about wrongness itself , the idea of wrong .
What is that idea ?
What makes something wrong ?
How do we know that it &apos;s wrong ? Maybe you and I disagree .
Maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong .
Maybe it &apos;s you , maybe it &apos;s me — but we &apos;re not here to trade opinions ; everyone &apos;s got an opinion .
We are here for knowledge .
Our enemy is thoughtlessness . This is philosophy . &quot; &quot; And something changes for Tony .
&quot; &quot; Could be I &apos;m wrong . I &apos;m tired of being wrong .
I want to know what is wrong .
I want to know what I know . &quot; &quot; What Tony sees in that moment is the project of philosophy , the project that begins in wonder — what Kant called &quot; &quot; admiration and awe at the starry sky above and the moral law within . &quot; &quot; What can creatures like us know of such things ?
It is the project that always takes us back to the condition of existence — what Heidegger called &quot; &quot; the always already there . &quot; &quot; It is the project of questioning what we believe and why we believe it — what Socrates called &quot; &quot; the examined life . &quot; &quot; Socrates , a man wise enough to know that he knows nothing .
Socrates died in prison , his philosophy intact .
So Tony starts doing his homework .
He learns his whys and wherefores , his causes and correlations , his logic , his fallacies .
Turns out , Tony &apos;s got the philosophy muscle .
His body is in prison , but his mind is free .
Tony learns about the ontologically promiscuous , the epistemologically anxious , the ethically dubious , the metaphysically ridiculous .
That &apos;s Plato , Descartes , Nietzsche and Bill Clinton .
So when he gives me his final paper , in which he argues that the categorical imperative is perhaps too uncompromising to deal with the conflict that affects our everyday and challenges me to tell him whether therefore we are condemned to moral failure , I say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know .
Let us think about that . &quot; &quot; Because in that moment , there &apos;s no mark by Tony &apos;s name ; it &apos;s just the two of us standing there .
It is not professor and convict , it is just two minds ready to do philosophy .
And I say to Tony , &quot; Let &apos;s do this . &quot;
Thank you .

I was depressed ; I said , but I can make a difference in this field .
So why don &apos;t we have a good theory of brains ?
Reality , though — I call it real intelligence .
It can attack . It can do all kinds of stuff .
But the robotics part is the hardest part . That &apos;s old brain . That &apos;s really hard .
Anyone ?
How about a moderate amount of stress ?
Yeah . Me too .
But that is not my confession .
It increases the risk of everything from the common cold to cardiovascular disease .
But I have changed my mind about stress , and today , I want to change yours .
Let me start with the study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress .
When you change your mind about stress , you can change your body &apos;s response to stress .
It &apos;s called the social stress test .
And unbeknownst to you , the experimenter has been trained to harass you during it .
That guy made a mistake .
And normally , we interpret these physical changes as anxiety or signs that we aren &apos;t coping very well with the pressure .
It &apos;s getting more oxygen to your brain .
And participants who learned to view the stress response as helpful for their performance , well , they were less stressed out , less anxious , more confident , but the most fascinating finding to me was how their physical stress response changed .
It &apos;s not really healthy to be in this state all the time .
It actually looks a lot like what happens in moments of joy and courage .
I no longer want to get rid of your stress .
I want to make you better at stress .
And we just did a little intervention .
Now I said I have over a decade of demonizing stress to redeem myself from , so we are going to do one more intervention .
It even has its own cute nickname , the cuddle hormone , because it &apos;s released when you hug someone .
But this is a very small part of what oxytocin is involved in .
It fine-tunes your brain &apos;s social instincts .
Oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family .
It enhances your empathy .
It even makes you more willing to help and support the people you care about .
But here &apos;s what most people don &apos;t understand about oxytocin .
It &apos;s a stress hormone .
Your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out as part of the stress response .
It &apos;s as much a part of your stress response as the adrenaline that makes your heart pound .
Your stress response wants to make sure you notice when someone else in your life is struggling so that you can support each other .
Okay , so how is knowing this side of stress going to make you healthier ?
It &apos;s a natural anti-inflammatory .
It also helps your blood vessels stay relaxed during stress .
But my favorite effect on the body is actually on the heart .
So when you reach out to others under stress , either to seek support or to help someone else , you release more of this hormone , your stress response becomes healthier , and you actually recover faster from stress .
Okay , so the bad news first : For every major stressful life experience , like financial difficulties or family crisis , that increased the risk of dying by 30 percent .
People who spent time caring for others showed absolutely no stress-related increase in dying .
Stress gives us access to our hearts .
And when you choose to view stress in this way , you &apos;re not just getting better at stress , you &apos;re actually making a pretty profound statement .
You &apos;re saying that you can trust yourself to handle life &apos;s challenges .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : This is kind of amazing , what you &apos;re telling us .
The Internet , the Web as we know it , the kind of Web — the things we &apos;re all talking about — is already less than 5,000 days old .
So all of the things that we &apos;ve seen come about , starting , say , with satellite images of the whole Earth , which we couldn &apos;t even imagine happening before , all these things rolling into our lives , just this abundance of things that are right before us , sitting in front of our laptop , or our desktop .
This kind of cornucopia of stuff just coming and never ending is amazing , and we &apos;re not amazed .
It &apos;s really amazing that all this stuff is here .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s in 5,000 days , all this stuff has come .
And I know that 10 years ago , if I had told you that this was all coming , you would have said that that &apos;s impossible .
There &apos;s simply no economic model that that would be possible .
And if I told you it was all coming for free , you would say , this is simply — you &apos;re dreaming .
You &apos;re a Californian utopian . You &apos;re a wild-eyed optimist .
And yet it &apos;s here .
The other thing that we know about it was that 10 years ago , as I looked at what even Wired was talking about , we thought it was going to be TV , but better .
That was the model . That was what everybody was suggesting was going to be coming .
And it turns out that that &apos;s not what it was .
First of all , it was impossible , and it &apos;s not what it was .
And so one of the things that I think we &apos;re learning — if you think about , like , Wikipedia , it &apos;s something that was simply impossible .
It &apos;s impossible in theory , but possible in practice .
And if you take all these things that are impossible , I think one of the things that we &apos;re learning from this era , from this last decade , is that we have to get good at believing in the impossible , because we &apos;re unprepared for it .
So , I &apos;m curious about what &apos;s going to happen in the next 5,000 days .
But if that &apos;s happened in the last 5,000 days , what &apos;s going to happen in the next 5,000 days ?
So , I have a kind of a simple story , and it suggests that what we want to think about is this thing that we &apos;re making , this thing that has happened in 5,000 days — that &apos;s all these computers , all these handhelds , all these cell phones , all these laptops , all these servers — basically what we &apos;re getting out of all these connections is we &apos;re getting one machine .
If there is only one machine , and our little handhelds and devices are actually just little windows into those machines , but that we &apos;re basically constructing a single , global machine .
And so I began to think about that .
And it turned out that this machine happens to be the most reliable machine that we &apos;ve ever made .
It has not crashed ; it &apos;s running uninterrupted .
And there &apos;s almost no other machine that we &apos;ve ever made that runs the number of hours , the number of days .
5,000 days without interruption — that &apos;s just unbelievable .
And of course , the Internet is longer than just 5,000 days ; the Web is only 5,000 days .
So , I was trying to basically make measurements .
What are the dimensions of this machine ?
And I started off by calculating how many billions of clicks there are all around the globe on all the computers .
And there is a 100 billion clicks per day .
And there &apos;s 55 trillion links between all the Web pages of the world .
And so I began thinking more about other kinds of dimensions , and I made a quick list . Was it Chris Jordan , the photographer , talking about numbers being so large that they &apos;re meaningless ?
Well , here &apos;s a list of them . They &apos;re hard to tell , but there &apos;s one billion PC chips on the Internet , if you count all the chips in all the computers on the Internet .
There &apos;s two million emails per second .
So it &apos;s a very big number .
It &apos;s just a huge machine , and it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet .
So here &apos;s the specifications , just as if you were to make up a spec sheet for it : 170 quadrillion transistors , 55 trillion links , emails running at two megahertz itself , 31 kilohertz text messaging , 246 exabyte storage . That &apos;s a big disk .
That &apos;s a lot of storage , memory . Nine exabyte RAM .
And the total traffic on this is running at seven terabytes per second .
Brewster was saying the Library of Congress is about twenty terabytes .
So every second , half of the Library of Congress is swooshing around in this machine . It &apos;s a big machine .
So I did something else . I figured out 100 billion clicks per day , 55 trillion links is almost the same as the number of synapses in your brain .
A quadrillion transistors is almost the same as the number of neurons in your brain .
So to a first approximation , we have these things — twenty petahertz synapse firings .
Of course , the memory is really huge .
But to a first approximation , the size of this machine is the size — and its complexity , kind of — to your brain .
Because in fact , that &apos;s how your brain works — in kind of the same way that the Web works .
However , your brain isn &apos;t doubling every two years .
So if we say this machine right now that we &apos;ve made is about one HB , one human brain , if we look at the rate that this is increasing , 30 years from now , there &apos;ll be six billion HBs .
So by the year 2040 , the total processing of this machine will exceed a total processing power of humanity , in raw bits and stuff . And this is , I think , where Ray Kurzweil and others get this little chart saying that we &apos;re going to cross .
So , what about that ? Well , here &apos;s a couple of things .
I have three kind of general things I would like to say , three consequences of this .
First , that basically what this machine is doing is embodying .
We &apos;re giving it a body . And that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do in the next 5,000 days — we &apos;re going to give this machine a body .
And the second thing is , we &apos;re going to restructure its architecture .
And thirdly , we &apos;re going to become completely codependent upon it .
So let me go through those three things .
First of all , we have all these things in our hands .
We think they &apos;re all separate devices , but in fact , every screen in the world is looking into the one machine .
These are all basically portals into that one machine .
The second thing is that — some people call this the cloud , and you &apos;re kind of touching the cloud with this .
And so in some ways , all you really need is a cloudbook .
And the cloudbook doesn &apos;t have any storage .
It &apos;s wireless . It &apos;s always connected .
There &apos;s many things about it . It becomes very simple , and basically what you &apos;re doing is you &apos;re just touching the machine , you &apos;re touching the cloud and you &apos;re going to compute that way .
So the machine is computing .
And in some ways , it &apos;s sort of back to the kind of old idea of centralized computing .
But everything , all the cameras , and the microphones , and the sensors in cars and everything is connected to this machine .
And everything will go through the Web .
And we &apos;re seeing that already with , say , phones .
Right now , phones don &apos;t go through the Web , but they are beginning to , and they will .
And if you imagine what , say , just as an example , what Google Labs has in terms of experiments with Google Docs , Google Spreadsheets , blah , blah , blah — all these things are going to become Web based .
They &apos;re going through the machine .
And I am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the Web .
Right now , it &apos;s not . If you do spreadsheets and things at work , a Word document , they aren &apos;t on the Web , but they are going to be . They &apos;re going to be part of this machine .
They &apos;re going to speak the Web language .
They &apos;re going to talk to the machine .
The Web , in some sense , is kind of like a black hole that &apos;s sucking up everything into it .
And so every thing will be part of the Web .
So every item , every artifact that we make , will have embedded in it some little sliver of Web-ness and connection , and it will be part of this machine , so that our environment — kind of in that ubiquitous computing sense — our environment becomes the Web . Everything is connected .
Now , with RFIDs and other things — whatever technology it is , it doesn &apos;t really matter . The point is that everything will have embedded in it some sensor connecting it to the machine , and so we have , basically , an Internet of things .
So you begin to think of a shoe as a chip with heels , and a car as a chip with wheels , because basically most of the cost of manufacturing cars is the embedded intelligence and electronics in it , and not the materials .
A lot of people think about the new economy as something that was going to be a disembodied , alternative , virtual existence , and that we would have the old economy of atoms .
But in fact , what the new economy really is is the marriage of those two , where we embed the information , and the digital nature of things into the material world .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re looking forward to . That is where we &apos;re going — this union , this convergence of the atomic and the digital .
And so one of the consequences of that , I believe , is that where we have this sort of spectrum of media right now — TV , film , video — that basically becomes one media platform .
And while there &apos;s many differences in some senses , they will share more and more in common with each other .
So that the laws of media , such as the fact that copies have no value , the value &apos;s in the uncopiable things , the immediacy , the authentication , the personalization .
The media wants to be liquid .
The reason why things are free is so that you can manipulate them , not so that they are &quot; &quot; free &quot; &quot; as in &quot; &quot; beer , &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; free &quot; &quot; as in &quot; &quot; freedom . &quot; &quot; And the network effects rule , meaning that the more you have , the more you get .
The first fax machine — the person who bought the first fax machine was an idiot , because there was nobody to fax to .
But here she became an evangelist , recruiting others to get the fax machines because it made their purchase more valuable .
Those are the effects that we &apos;re going to see .
Attention is the currency .
So those laws are going to kind of spread throughout all media .
And the other thing about this embodiment is that there &apos;s kind of what I call the McLuhan reversal .
McLuhan was saying , &quot; &quot; Machines are the extensions of the human senses . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; Humans are now going to be the extended senses of the machine , &quot; &quot; in a certain sense .
So we have a trillion eyes , and ears , and touches , through all our digital photographs and cameras .
And we see that in things like Flickr , or Photosynth , this program from Microsoft that will allow you to assemble a view of a touristy place from the thousands of tourist snapshots of it .
In a certain sense , the machine is seeing through the pixels of individual cameras .
Now , the second thing that I want to talk about was this idea of restructuring , that what the Web is doing is restructuring .
And I have to warn you , that what we &apos;ll talk about is — I &apos;m going to give my explanation of a term you &apos;re hearing , which is a &quot; &quot; semantic Web . &quot; &quot; So first of all , the first stage that we &apos;ve seen of the Internet was that it was going to link computers .
And that &apos;s what we called the Net ; that was the Internet of nets .
And we saw that , where you have all the computers of the world .
And if you remember , it was a kind of green screen with cursors , and there was really not much to do , and if you wanted to connect it , you connected it from one computer to another computer .
And what you had to do was — if you wanted to participate in this , you had to share packets of information .
So you were forwarding on . You didn &apos;t have control .
It wasn &apos;t like a telephone system where you had control of a line : you had to share packets .
The second stage that we &apos;re in now is the idea of linking pages .
So in the old one , if I wanted to go on to an airline Web page , I went from my computer , to an FTP site , to another airline computer .
Now we have pages — the unit has been resolved into pages , so one page links to another page .
And if I want to go in to book a flight , I go into the airline &apos;s flight page , the website of the airline , and I &apos;m linking to that page .
And what we &apos;re sharing were links , so you had to be kind of open with links .
You couldn &apos;t deny — if someone wanted to link to you , you couldn &apos;t stop them . You had to participate in this idea of opening up your pages to be linked by anybody .
So that &apos;s what we were doing .
We &apos;re now entering to the third stage , which is what I &apos;m talking about , and that is where we link the data .
So , I don &apos;t know what the name of this thing is .
I &apos;m calling it the one machine . But we &apos;re linking data .
So we &apos;re going from machine to machine , from page to page , and now data to data .
So the difference is , is that rather than linking from page to page , we &apos;re actually going to link from one idea on a page to another idea , rather than to the other page .
So every idea is basically being supported — or every item , or every noun — is being supported by the entire Web .
It &apos;s being resolved at the level of items , or ideas , or words , if you want .
So besides physically coming out again into this idea that it &apos;s not just virtual , it &apos;s actually going out to things .
So something will resolve down to the information about a particular person , so every person will have a unique ID .
Every person , every item will have a something that will be very specific , and will link to a specific representation of that idea or item .
So now , in this new one , when I link to it , I would link to my particular flight , my particular seat .
And so , giving an example of this thing , I live in Pacifica , rather than — right now Pacifica is just sort of a name on the Web somewhere .
The Web doesn &apos;t know that that is actually a town , and that it &apos;s a specific town that I live in , but that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to be talking about .
It &apos;s going to link directly to — it will know , the Web will be able to read itself and know that that actually is a place , and that whenever it sees that word , &quot; &quot; Pacifica , &quot; &quot; it knows that it actually has a place , latitude , longitude , a certain population .
So here are some of the technical terms , all three-letter things , that you &apos;ll see a lot more of .
All these things are about enabling this idea of linking to the data .
So I &apos;ll give you one kind of an example .
There &apos;s like a billion social sites on the Web .
Each time you go into there , you have to tell it again who you are and all your friends are .
Why should you be doing that ? You should just do that once , and it should know who all your friends are .
So that &apos;s what you want , is all your friends are identified , and you should just carry these relationships around .
All this data about you should just be conveyed , and you should do it once and that &apos;s all that should happen .
And you should have all the networks of all the relationships between those pieces of data .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re moving into — where it sort of knows these things down to that level .
A semantic Web , Web 3.0 , giant global graph — we &apos;re kind of trying out what we want to call this thing .
But what &apos;s it &apos;s doing is sharing data .
So you have to be open to having your data shared , which is a much bigger step than just sharing your Web page , or your computer .
And all these things that are going to be on this are not just pages , they are things .
Everything we &apos;ve described , every artifact or place , will be a specific representation , will have a specific character that can be linked to directly .
So we have this database of things .
And so there &apos;s actually a fourth thing that we have not get to , that we won &apos;t see in the next 10 years , or 5,000 days , but I think that &apos;s where we &apos;re going to . And as the Internet of things — where I &apos;m linking directly to the particular things of my seat on the plane — that that physical thing becomes part of the Web .
And so we are in the middle of this thing that &apos;s completely linked , down to every object in the little sliver of a connection that it has .
So , the last thing I want to talk about is this idea that we &apos;re going to be codependent .
It &apos;s always going to be there , and the closer it is , the better .
If you allow Google to , it will tell you your search history .
And I found out by looking at it that I search most at 11 o &apos;clock in the morning .
So I am open , and being transparent to that .
And I think total personalization in this new world will require total transparency .
That is going to be the price .
If you want to have total personalization , you have to be totally transparent .
Google . I can &apos;t remember my phone number , I &apos;ll just ask Google .
We &apos;re so dependent on this that I have now gotten to the point where I don &apos;t even try to remember things — I &apos;ll just Google it . It &apos;s easier to do that .
And we kind of object at first , saying , &quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s awful . &quot; &quot; But if we think about the dependency that we have on this other technology , called the alphabet , and writing , we &apos;re totally dependent on it , and it &apos;s transformed culture .
We cannot imagine ourselves without the alphabet and writing .
And so in the same way , we &apos;re going to not imagine ourselves without this other machine being there .
And what is happening with this is some kind of AI , but it &apos;s not the AI in conscious AI , as being an expert , Larry Page told me that that &apos;s what they &apos;re trying to do , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re trying to do .
But when six billion humans are Googling , who &apos;s searching who ? It goes both ways .
So we are the Web , that &apos;s what this thing is .
We are going to be the machine .
So the next 5,000 days , it &apos;s not going to be the Web and only better .
Just like it wasn &apos;t TV and only better .
The next 5,000 days , it &apos;s not just going to be the Web but only better — it &apos;s going to be something different .
And I think it &apos;s going to be smarter .
It &apos;ll have an intelligence in there , that &apos;s not , again , conscious .
But it &apos;ll anticipate what we &apos;re doing , in a good sense .
Secondly , it &apos;s become much more personalized .
It will know us , and that &apos;s good .
And again , the price of that will be transparency .
And thirdly , it &apos;s going to become more ubiquitous in terms of filling your entire environment , and we will be in the middle of it .
And all these devices will be portals into that .
So the single idea that I wanted to leave with you is that we have to begin to think about this as not just &quot; &quot; the Web , only better , &quot; &quot; but a new kind of stage in this development .
It looks more global . If you take this whole thing , it is a very big machine , very reliable machine , more reliable than its parts .
But we can also think about it as kind of a large organism .
So we might respond to it more as if this was a whole system , more as if this wasn &apos;t a large organism that we are going to be interacting with . It &apos;s a &quot; &quot; One . &quot; &quot; And I don &apos;t know what else to call it , than the One .
We &apos;ll have a better word for it .
But there &apos;s a unity of some sort that &apos;s starting to emerge .
And again , I don &apos;t want to talk about consciousness , I want to talk about it just as if it was a little bacteria , or a volvox , which is what that organism is .
So , to do , action , take-away . So , here &apos;s what I would say : there &apos;s only one machine , and the Web is its OS .
All screens look into the One . No bits will live outside the Web .
To share is to gain . Let the One read it .
It &apos;s going to be machine-readable .
You want to make something that the machine can read .
And the One is us . We are in the One .
I appreciate your time .

There &apos;s the life that everyone sees , and then there &apos;s the life that only I see .
And in the life that everyone sees , who I am is a friend , a son , a brother , a stand-up comedian and a teenager .
That &apos;s the life everyone sees .
If you were to ask my friends and family to describe me , that &apos;s what they would tell you .
And that &apos;s a huge part of me . That is who I am .
And if you were to ask me to describe myself , I &apos;d probably say some of those same things .
And I wouldn &apos;t be lying , but I wouldn &apos;t totally be telling you the truth , either , because the truth is , that &apos;s just the life everyone else sees .
In the life that only I see , who I am , who I really am , is someone who struggles intensely with depression .
I have for the last six years of my life , and I continue to every day .
Now , for someone who has never experienced depression or doesn &apos;t really know what that means , that might surprise them to hear , because there &apos;s this pretty popular misconception that depression is just being sad when something in your life goes wrong , when you break up with your girlfriend , when you lose a loved one , when you don &apos;t get the job you wanted .
But that &apos;s sadness . That &apos;s a natural thing .
That &apos;s a natural human emotion .
Real depression isn &apos;t being sad when something in your life goes wrong .
Real depression is being sad when everything in your life is going right .
That &apos;s real depression , and that &apos;s what I suffer from .
And to be totally honest , that &apos;s hard for me to stand up here and say .
It &apos;s hard for me to talk about , and it seems to be hard for everyone to talk about , so much so that no one &apos;s talking about it .
And no one &apos;s talking about depression , but we need to be , because right now it &apos;s a massive problem .
It &apos;s a massive problem .
But we don &apos;t see it on social media , right ?
We don &apos;t see it on Facebook . We don &apos;t see it on Twitter .
We don &apos;t see it on the news , because it &apos;s not happy , it &apos;s not fun , it &apos;s not light .
And so because we don &apos;t see it , we don &apos;t see the severity of it .
But the severity of it and the seriousness of it is this : every 30 seconds , every 30 seconds , somewhere , someone in the world takes their own life because of depression , and it might be two blocks away , it might be two countries away , it might be two continents away , but it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s happening every single day .
And we have a tendency , as a society , to look at that and go , &quot; &quot; So what ? &quot; &quot; So what ? We look at that , and we go , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s your problem .
That &apos;s their problem . &quot; &quot; We say we &apos;re sad and we say we &apos;re sorry , but we also say , &quot; &quot; So what ? &quot; &quot; Well , two years ago it was my problem , because I sat on the edge of my bed where I &apos;d sat a million times before and I was suicidal .
I was suicidal , and if you were to look at my life on the surface , you wouldn &apos;t see a kid who was suicidal .
You &apos;d see a kid who was the captain of his basketball team , the drama and theater student of the year , the English student of the year , someone who was consistently on the honor roll and consistently at every party .
So you would say I wasn &apos;t depressed , you would say I wasn &apos;t suicidal , but you would be wrong .
You would be wrong . So I sat there that night beside a bottle of pills with a pen and paper in my hand and I thought about taking my own life and I came this close to doing it . I came this close to doing it .
And I didn &apos;t , so that makes me one of the lucky ones ,
one of the people who gets to step out on the ledge and look down but not jump , one of the lucky ones who survives .
Well , I survived , and that just leaves me with my story , and my story is this : In four simple words , I suffer from depression .
I was afraid that people would see me for who I really was , that I wasn &apos;t the perfect , popular kid in high school everyone thought I was , that beneath my smile , there was struggle , and beneath my light , there was dark , and beneath my big personality just hid even bigger pain .
See , some people might fear girls not liking them back .
Some people might fear sharks . Some people might fear death .
But for me , for a large part of my life , I feared myself .
I feared my truth , I feared my honesty , I feared my vulnerability , and that fear made me feel like I was forced into a corner , like I was forced into a corner and there was only one way out , and so I thought about that way every single day .
I thought about it every single day , and if I &apos;m being totally honest , standing here I &apos;ve thought about it again since , because that &apos;s the sickness , that &apos;s the struggle , that &apos;s depression , and depression isn &apos;t chicken pox .
You don &apos;t beat it once and it &apos;s gone forever .
It &apos;s something you live with . It &apos;s something you live in .
It &apos;s the roommate you can &apos;t kick out . It &apos;s the voice you can &apos;t ignore .
It &apos;s the feelings you can &apos;t seem to escape , the scariest part is that after a while , you become numb to it . It becomes normal for you , and what you really fear the most isn &apos;t the suffering inside of you .
It &apos;s the stigma inside of others , it &apos;s the shame , it &apos;s the embarrassment , it &apos;s the disapproving look on a friend &apos;s face , it &apos;s the whispers in the hallway that you &apos;re weak , it &apos;s the comments that you &apos;re crazy .
That &apos;s what keeps you from getting help .
That &apos;s what makes you hold it in and hide it .
It &apos;s the stigma . So you hold it in and you hide it , and you hold it in and you hide it , and even though it &apos;s keeping you in bed every day and it &apos;s making your life feel empty no matter how much you try and fill it , you hide it , because the stigma in our society around depression is very real .
It &apos;s very real , and if you think that it isn &apos;t , ask yourself this : Would you rather make your next Facebook status say you &apos;re having a tough time getting out of bed because you hurt your back or you &apos;re having a tough time getting out of bed every morning because you &apos;re depressed ?
That &apos;s the stigma , because unfortunately , we live in a world where if you break your arm , everyone runs over to sign your cast , but if you tell people you &apos;re depressed , everyone runs the other way .
That &apos;s the stigma .
We are so , so , so accepting of any body part breaking down other than our brains . And that &apos;s ignorance .
That &apos;s pure ignorance , and that ignorance has created a world that doesn &apos;t understand depression , that doesn &apos;t understand mental health .
And that &apos;s ironic to me , because depression is one of the best documented problems we have in the world , yet it &apos;s one of the least discussed .
We just push it aside and put it in a corner and pretend it &apos;s not there and hope it &apos;ll fix itself .
Well , it won &apos;t . It hasn &apos;t , and it &apos;s not going to , because that &apos;s wishful thinking , and wishful thinking isn &apos;t a game plan , it &apos;s procrastination , and we can &apos;t procrastinate on something this important .
The first step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one .
Well , we haven &apos;t done that , so we can &apos;t really expect to find an answer when we &apos;re still afraid of the question .
And I don &apos;t know what the solution is .
I wish I did , but I don &apos;t — but I think , I think it has to start here .
It has to start with me , it has to start with you , it has to start with the people who are suffering , the ones who are hidden in the shadows .
We need to speak up and shatter the silence .
We need to be the ones who are brave for what we believe in , because if there &apos;s one thing that I &apos;ve come to realize , if there &apos;s one thing that I see as the biggest problem , it &apos;s not in building a world where we eliminate the ignorance of others .
It &apos;s in building a world where we teach the acceptance of ourselves , where we &apos;re okay with who we are , because when we get honest , we see that we all struggle and we all suffer .
Whether it &apos;s with this , whether it &apos;s with something else , we all know what it is to hurt .
We all know what it is to have pain in our heart , and we all know how important it is to heal .
But right now , depression is society &apos;s deep cut that we &apos;re content to put a Band-Aid over and pretend it &apos;s not there .
Well , it is there . It is there , and you know what ? It &apos;s okay .
Depression is okay . If you &apos;re going through it , know that you &apos;re okay .
And know that you &apos;re sick , you &apos;re not weak , and it &apos;s an issue , not an identity , because when you get past the fear and the ridicule and the judgment and the stigma of others , you can see depression for what it really is , and that &apos;s just a part of life , just a part of life , and as much as I hate , as much as I hate some of the places , some of the parts of my life depression has dragged me down to , in a lot of ways I &apos;m grateful for it .
Because yeah , it &apos;s put me in the valleys , but only to show me there &apos;s peaks , and yeah it &apos;s dragged me through the dark but only to remind me there is light .
My pain , more than anything in 19 years on this planet , has given me perspective , and my hurt , my hurt has forced me to have hope , have hope and to have faith , faith in myself , faith in others , faith that it can get better , that we can change this , that we can speak up and speak out and fight back against ignorance , fight back against intolerance , and more than anything , learn to love ourselves , learn to accept ourselves for who we are , the people we are , not the people the world wants us to be .
Because the world I believe in is one where embracing your light doesn &apos;t mean ignoring your dark .
The world I believe in is one where we &apos;re measured by our ability to overcome adversities , not avoid them .
The world I believe in is one where I can look someone in the eye and say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going through hell , &quot; &quot; and they can look back at me and go , &quot; &quot; Me too , &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s okay , and it &apos;s okay because depression is okay . We &apos;re people .
We &apos;re people , and we struggle and we suffer and we bleed and we cry , and if you think that true strength means never showing any weakness , then I &apos;m here to tell you you &apos;re wrong .
You &apos;re wrong , because it &apos;s the opposite .
We &apos;re people , and we have problems .
We &apos;re not perfect , and that &apos;s okay .
So we need to stop the ignorance , stop the intolerance , stop the stigma , and stop the silence , and we need to take away the taboos , take a look at the truth , and start talking , because the only way we &apos;re going to beat a problem that people are battling alone is by standing strong together , by standing strong together .
And I believe that we can .
I believe that we can . Thank you guys so much .

Today , I &apos;m going to take you around the world in 18 minutes .
My base of operations is in the U.S. , but let &apos;s start at the other end of the map , in Kyoto , Japan , where I was living with a Japanese family while I was doing part of my dissertational research 15 years ago .
I knew even then that I would encounter cultural differences and misunderstandings , but they popped up when I least expected it .
On my first day , I went to a restaurant , and I ordered a cup of green tea with sugar .
After a pause , the waiter said , &quot; One does not put sugar in green tea . &quot;
&quot; &quot; I know , &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m aware of this custom .
But I really like my tea sweet . &quot; &quot; In response , he gave me an even more courteous version of the same explanation .
&quot; &quot; One does not put sugar in green tea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I understand , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; that the Japanese do not put sugar in their green tea , but I &apos;d like to put some sugar in my green tea . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Surprised by my insistence , the waiter took up the issue with the manager .
Pretty soon , a lengthy discussion ensued , and finally the manager came over to me and said , &quot; I am very sorry . We do not have sugar . &quot;
( Laughter ) Well , since I couldn &apos;t have my tea the way I wanted it , I ordered a cup of coffee , which the waiter brought over promptly .
Resting on the saucer were two packets of sugar .
My failure to procure myself a cup of sweet , green tea was not due to a simple misunderstanding .
This was due to a fundamental difference in our ideas about choice .
From my American perspective , when a paying customer makes a reasonable request based on her preferences , she has every right to have that request met .
The American way , to quote Burger King , is to &quot; &quot; have it your way , &quot; &quot; because , as Starbucks says , &quot; happiness is in your choices . &quot;
( Laughter ) But from the Japanese perspective , it &apos;s their duty to protect those who don &apos;t know any better — ( Laughter ) in this case , the ignorant gaijin — from making the wrong choice .
Let &apos;s face it : the way I wanted my tea was inappropriate according to cultural standards , and they were doing their best to help me save face .
Americans tend to believe that they &apos;ve reached some sort of pinnacle in the way they practice choice .
They think that choice , as seen through the American lens best fulfills an innate and universal desire for choice in all humans .
Unfortunately , these beliefs are based on assumptions that don &apos;t always hold true in many countries , in many cultures .
At times they don &apos;t even hold true at America &apos;s own borders .
I &apos;d like to discuss some of these assumptions and the problems associated with them .
As I do so , I hope you &apos;ll start thinking about some of your own assumptions and how they were shaped by your backgrounds .
First assumption : if a choice affects you , then you should be the one to make it .
This is the only way to ensure that your preferences and interests will be most fully accounted for .
It is essential for success .
In America , the primary locus of choice is the individual .
People must choose for themselves , sometimes sticking to their guns , regardless of what other people want or recommend .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; being true to yourself . &quot; &quot; But do all individuals benefit from taking such an approach to choice ?
Mark Lepper and I did a series of studies in which we sought the answer to this very question .
In one study , which we ran in Japantown , San Francisco , we brought seven- to nine-year-old Anglo- and Asian-American children into the laboratory , and we divided them up into three groups .
The first group came in , and they were greeted by Miss Smith , who showed them six big piles of anagram puzzles .
The kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do , and they even got to choose which marker they would write their answers with .
When the second group of children came in , they were brought to the same room , shown the same anagrams , but this time Miss Smith told them which anagrams to do and which markers to write their answers with .
Now when the third group came in , they were told that their anagrams and their markers had been chosen by their mothers .
( Laughter ) In reality , the kids who were told what to do , whether by Miss Smith or their mothers , were actually given the very same activity , which their counterparts in the first group had freely chosen .
With this procedure , we were able to ensure that the kids across the three groups all did the same activity , making it easier for us to compare performance .
Such small differences in the way we administered the activity yielded striking differences in how well they performed .
Anglo-Americans , they did two and a half times more anagrams when they got to choose them , as compared to when it was chosen for them by Miss Smith or their mothers .
It didn &apos;t matter who did the choosing , if the task was dictated by another , their performance suffered .
In fact , some of the kids were visibly embarrassed when they were told that their mothers had been consulted .
( Laughter ) One girl named Mary said , &quot; You asked my mother ? &quot; ( Laughter )
In contrast , Asian-American children performed best when they believed their mothers had made the choice , second best when they chose for themselves , and least well when it had been chosen by Miss Smith .
A girl named Natsumi even approached Miss Smith as she was leaving the room and tugged on her skirt and asked , &quot; &quot; Could you please tell my mommy I did it just like she said ? &quot; &quot; The first-generation children were strongly influenced by their immigrant parents &apos; approach to choice .
For them , choice was not just a way of defining and asserting their individuality , but a way to create community and harmony by deferring to the choices of people whom they trusted and respected .
If they had a concept of being true to one &apos;s self , then that self , most likely , &#91; was &#93; composed , not of an individual , but of a collective .
Success was just as much about pleasing key figures as it was about satisfying one &apos;s own preferences .
Or , you could say that the individual &apos;s preferences were shaped by the preferences of specific others .
The assumption then that we do best when the individual self chooses only holds when that self is clearly divided from others .
When , in contrast , two or more individuals see their choices and their outcomes as intimately connected , then they may amplify one another &apos;s success by turning choosing into a collective act .
To insist that they choose independently might actually compromise both their performance and their relationships .
Yet that is exactly what the American paradigm demands .
It leaves little room for interdependence or an acknowledgment of individual fallibility .
It requires that everyone treat choice as a private and self-defining act .
People that have grown up in such a paradigm might find it motivating , but it is a mistake to assume that everyone thrives under the pressure of choosing alone .
The second assumption which informs the American view of choice goes something like this .
The more choices you have , the more likely you are to make the best choice .
So bring it on , Walmart , with 100,000 different products , and Amazon , with 27 million books and Match.com with — what is it ? — 15 million date possibilities now .
You will surely find the perfect match .
Let &apos;s test this assumption by heading over to Eastern Europe .
Here , I interviewed people who were residents of formerly communist countries , who had all faced the challenge of transitioning to a more democratic and capitalistic society .
One of the most interesting revelations came not from an answer to a question , but from a simple gesture of hospitality .
When the participants arrived for their interview , I offered them a set of drinks : Coke , Diet Coke , Sprite — seven , to be exact .
During the very first session , which was run in Russia , one of the participants made a comment that really caught me off guard .
&quot; &quot; Oh , but it doesn &apos;t matter .
It &apos;s all just soda . That &apos;s just one choice . &quot; &quot; ( Murmuring ) I was so struck by this comment that from then on , I started to offer all the participants those seven sodas , and I asked them , &quot; &quot; How many choices are these ? &quot; &quot; Again and again , they perceived these seven different sodas , not as seven choices , but as one choice : soda or no soda .
When I put out juice and water in addition to these seven sodas , now they perceived it as only three choices — juice , water and soda .
Compare this to the die-hard devotion of many Americans , not just to a particular flavor of soda , but to a particular brand .
You know , research shows repeatedly that we can &apos;t actually tell the difference between Coke and Pepsi .
Of course , you and I know that Coke is the better choice .
( Laughter ) For modern Americans who are exposed to more options and more ads associated with options than anyone else in the world , choice is just as much about who they are as it is about what the product is .
Combine this with the assumption that more choices are always better , and you have a group of people for whom every little difference matters and so every choice matters .
But for Eastern Europeans , the sudden availability of all these consumer products on the marketplace was a deluge .
They were flooded with choice before they could protest that they didn &apos;t know how to swim .
When asked , &quot; &quot; What words and images do you associate with choice ? &quot; &quot; Grzegorz from Warsaw said , &quot; &quot; Ah , for me it is fear .
There are some dilemmas you see .
I am used to no choice . &quot; &quot; Bohdan from Kiev said , in response to how he felt about the new consumer marketplace , &quot; &quot; It is too much .
We do not need everything that is there . &quot; &quot; A sociologist from the Warsaw Survey Agency explained , &quot; &quot; The older generation jumped from nothing to choice all around them .
They were never given a chance to learn how to react . &quot; &quot; And Tomasz , a young Polish man said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t need twenty kinds of chewing gum .
I don &apos;t mean to say that I want no choice , but many of these choices are quite artificial . &quot; &quot; In reality , many choices are between things that are not that much different .
The value of choice depends on our ability to perceive differences between the options .
Americans train their whole lives to play &quot; &quot; spot the difference . &quot; &quot; They practice this from such an early age that they &apos;ve come to believe that everyone must be born with this ability .
In fact , though all humans share a basic need and desire for choice , we don &apos;t all see choice in the same places or to the same extent .
When someone can &apos;t see how one choice is unlike another , or when there are too many choices to compare and contrast , the process of choosing can be confusing and frustrating .
Instead of making better choices , we become overwhelmed by choice , sometimes even afraid of it .
Choice no longer offers opportunities , but imposes constraints .
It &apos;s not a marker of liberation , but of suffocation by meaningless minutiae .
In other words , choice can develop into the very opposite of everything it represents in America when it is thrust upon those who are insufficiently prepared for it .
But it is not only other people in other places that are feeling the pressure of ever-increasing choice .
Americans themselves are discovering that unlimited choice seems more attractive in theory than in practice .
We all have physical , mental and emotional ( Laughter ) limitations that make it impossible for us to process every single choice we encounter , even in the grocery store , let alone over the course of our entire lives .
A number of my studies have shown that when you give people 10 or more options when they &apos;re making a choice , they make poorer decisions , whether it be health care , investment , other critical areas .
Yet still , many of us believe that we should make all our own choices and seek out even more of them .
This brings me to the third , and perhaps most problematic , assumption : &quot; &quot; You must never say no to choice . &quot; &quot; To examine this , let &apos;s go back to the U.S.
and then hop across the pond to France .
Right outside Chicago , a young couple , Susan and Daniel Mitchell , were about to have their first baby .
They &apos;d already picked out a name for her , Barbara , after her grandmother .
One night , when Susan was seven months pregnant , she started to experience contractions and was rushed to the emergency room .
The baby was delivered through a C-section , but Barbara suffered cerebral anoxia , a loss of oxygen to the brain .
Unable to breathe on her own , she was put on a ventilator .
Two days later , the doctors gave the Mitchells a choice : They could either remove Barbara off the life support , in which case she would die within a matter of hours , or they could keep her on life support , in which case she might still die within a matter of days .
If she survived , she would remain in a permanent vegetative state , never able to walk , talk or interact with others .
What do they do ?
What do any parent do ?
In a study I conducted with Simona Botti and Kristina Orfali , American and French parents were interviewed .
They had all suffered the same tragedy .
In all cases , the life support was removed , and the infants had died .
But there was a big difference .
In France , the doctors decided whether and when the life support would be removed , while in the United States , the final decision rested with the parents .
We wondered : does this have an effect on how the parents cope with the loss of their loved one ?
We found that it did .
Even up to a year later , American parents were more likely to express negative emotions , as compared to their French counterparts .
French parents were more likely to say things like , &quot; &quot; Noah was here for so little time , but he taught us so much .
He gave us a new perspective on life . &quot; &quot; American parents were more likely to say things like , &quot; What if ? What if ? &quot;
Another parent complained , &quot; &quot; I feel as if they purposefully tortured me .
How did they get me to do that ? &quot; &quot; And another parent said , &quot; &quot; I feel as if I &apos;ve played a role in an execution . &quot; &quot; But when the American parents were asked if they would rather have had the doctors make the decision , they all said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; They could not imagine turning that choice over to another , even though having made that choice made them feel trapped , guilty , angry .
In a number of cases they were even clinically depressed .
These parents could not contemplate giving up the choice , because to do so would have gone contrary to everything they had been taught and everything they had come to believe about the power and purpose of choice .
In her essay , &quot; &quot; The White Album , &quot; &quot; Joan Didion writes , &quot; &quot; We tell ourselves stories in order to live .
We interpret what we see , select the most workable of the multiple choices .
We live entirely by the imposition of a narrative line upon disparate images , by the idea with which we have learned to freeze the shifting phantasmagoria , which is our actual experience . &quot; &quot; The story Americans tell , the story upon which the American dream depends , is the story of limitless choice .
This narrative promises so much : freedom , happiness , success .
It lays the world at your feet and says , &quot; You can have anything , everything . &quot;
It &apos;s a great story , and it &apos;s understandable why they would be reluctant to revise it .
But when you take a close look , you start to see the holes , and you start to see that the story can be told in many other ways .
Americans have so often tried to disseminate their ideas of choice , believing that they will be , or ought to be , welcomed with open hearts and minds .
But the history books and the daily news tell us it doesn &apos;t always work out that way .
The phantasmagoria , the actual experience that we try to understand and organize through narrative , varies from place to place .
No single narrative serves the needs of everyone everywhere .
Moreover , Americans themselves could benefit from incorporating new perspectives into their own narrative , which has been driving their choices for so long .
Robert Frost once said that , &quot; It is poetry that is lost in translation . &quot;
This suggests that whatever is beautiful and moving , whatever gives us a new way to see , cannot be communicated to those who speak a different language .
But Joseph Brodsky said that , &quot; &quot; It is poetry that is gained in translation , &quot; &quot; suggesting that translation can be a creative , transformative act .
When it comes to choice , we have far more to gain than to lose by engaging in the many translations of the narratives .
Instead of replacing one story with another , we can learn from and revel in the many versions that exist and the many that have yet to be written .
No matter where we &apos;re from and what your narrative is , we all have a responsibility to open ourselves up to a wider array of what choice can do , and what it can represent .
And this does not lead to a paralyzing moral relativism .
Rather , it teaches us when and how to act .
It brings us that much closer to realizing the full potential of choice , to inspiring the hope and achieving the freedom that choice promises but doesn &apos;t always deliver .
If we learn to speak to one another , albeit through translation , then we can begin to see choice in all its strangeness , complexity and compelling beauty .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Bruno Giussani : Thank you .
Sheena , there is a detail about your biography that we have not written in the program book .
But by now it &apos;s evident to everyone in this room . You &apos;re blind .
And I guess one of the questions on everybody &apos;s mind is : How does that influence your study of choosing because that &apos;s an activity that for most people is associated with visual inputs like aesthetics and color and so on ?
Sheena Iyengar : Well , it &apos;s funny that you should ask that because one of the things that &apos;s interesting about being blind is you actually get a different vantage point when you observe the way sighted people make choices .
And as you just mentioned , there &apos;s lots of choices out there that are very visual these days .
Yeah , I — as you would expect — get pretty frustrated by choices like what nail polish to put on because I have to rely on what other people suggest .
And I can &apos;t decide .
And so one time I was in a beauty salon , and I was trying to decide between two very light shades of pink .
And one was called &quot; &quot; Ballet Slippers . &quot; &quot; And the other one was called &quot; &quot; Adorable . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so I asked these two ladies , and the one lady told me , &quot; &quot; Well , you should definitely wear &apos; Ballet Slippers . &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , what does it look like ? &quot;
&quot; Well , it &apos;s a very elegant shade of pink . &quot;
&quot; Okay , great . &quot;
The other lady tells me to wear &quot; &quot; Adorable . &quot; &quot; &quot; What does it look like ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s a glamorous shade of pink . &quot;
And so I asked them , &quot; &quot; Well , how do I tell them apart ?
What &apos;s different about them ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , one is elegant , the other one &apos;s glamorous . &quot; &quot; Okay , we got that .
And the only thing they had consensus on : well , if I could see them , I would clearly be able to tell them apart .
( Laughter ) And what I wondered was whether they were being affected by the name or the content of the color , so I decided to do a little experiment .
So I brought these two bottles of nail polish into the laboratory , and I stripped the labels off .
And I brought women into the laboratory , and I asked them , &quot; &quot; Which one would you pick ? &quot; &quot; 50 percent of the women accused me of playing a trick , of putting the same color nail polish in both those bottles .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) At which point you start to wonder who the trick &apos;s really played on .
Now , of the women that could tell them apart , when the labels were off , they picked &quot; &quot; Adorable , &quot; &quot; and when the labels were on , they picked &quot; &quot; Ballet Slippers . &quot; &quot; So as far as I can tell , a rose by any other name probably does look different and maybe even smells different .
BG : Thank you . Sheena Iyengar . Thank you Sheena .

Thirteen years ago , we set ourselves a goal to end poverty .
After some success , we &apos;ve hit a big hurdle .
The aftermath of the financial crisis has begun to hit aid payments , which have fallen for two consecutive years .
My question is whether the lessons learned from saving the financial system can be used to help us overcome that hurdle and help millions .
Can we simply print money for aid ?
&quot; Surely not . &quot;
It &apos;s a common reaction .
Others channel John McEnroe .
&quot; You cannot be serious ! &quot;
On the left , we have Pia .
She lives in England .
She has two loving parents , one of whom is standing right here .
Dorothy , on the right , lives in rural Kenya .
She &apos;s one of 13,000 orphans and vulnerable children who are assisted by a charity that I support .
I do that because I believe that Dorothy , like Pia , deserves the best life chances that we can afford to give her .
You &apos;ll all agree with me , I &apos;m sure .
The U.N. agrees too .
Their overriding aim for international aid is to strive for a life of dignity for all .
But — and here &apos;s that hurdle — can we afford our aid aspirations ?
History suggests not .
As you can see , a big gap opens up between actual aid and that target .
But then come the Millennium Development Goals , eight ambitious targets to be met by 2015 .
If I tell you that just one of those targets is to eradicate extreme hunger and poverty , you get a sense of the ambition .
There &apos;s also been some success .
But a lot remains to be done in two years .
One in eight remain hungry .
In the context of this auditorium , the front two rows aren &apos;t going to get any food .
We can &apos;t settle for that , which is why the concern about the eighth goal , which relates to funding , which I said at the beginning is falling , is so troubling .
So what can be done ?
Well , I work in financial markets , not development .
I study the behavior of investors , how they react to policy and the economy .
It gives me a different angle on the aid issue .
But it took an innocent question from my then-four-year-old daughter to make me appreciate that .
Pia and I were on the way to a local cafe and we passed a man collecting for charity .
I didn &apos;t have any change to give him , and she was disappointed .
Once in the cafe , Pia takes out her coloring book and starts scribbling .
After a little while , I ask her what she &apos;s doing , and she shows me a drawing of a £ 5 note to give to the man outside .
It &apos;s so sweet , and more generous than Dad would have been .
To which I get the classic four-year-old response : &quot; Why not ? &quot;
So I launch into an explanation of how an unlimited supply of money chasing a limited number of goods sends prices to the moon .
Something about that exchange stuck with me , not because of the look of relief on Pia &apos;s face when I finally finished , but because it related to the sanctity of the money supply , a sanctity that had been challenged and questioned by the reaction of central banks to the financial crisis .
To reassure investors , central banks began buying assets to try and encourage investors to do the same .
They funded these purchases with money they created themselves .
The money wasn &apos;t actually physically printed .
It &apos;s still sort of locked away in the banking system today .
But the amount created was unprecedented .
Together , the central banks of the U.S. , U.K and Japan increased the stock of money in their economies by 3.7 trillion dollars .
That &apos;s three times , in fact that &apos;s more than three times , the total physical stock of dollar notes in circulation .
Three times !
Before the crisis , this would have been utterly unthinkable , yet it was accepted remarkably quickly .
They bought fixed income securities , bonds .
They bought equities too .
For all the scare stories , the actual actions of investors spoke of rapid acceptance and confidence .
That confidence was based on two pillars .
Secondly , inflation simply never became a threat .
It was the same elsewhere .
So how does all this relate to aid ?
Well , this is where Dorothy and the Mango Tree charity that supports her comes in .
I was at one of their fundraising events earlier this year , and I was inspired to give a one-off donation when I remembered that my firm offers to match the charitable contributions its employees make .
So think of this : Instead of just being able to help Dorothy and four of her classmates to go through secondary school for a few years , I was able to double my contribution .
Brilliant .
Let &apos;s call this scheme &quot; &quot; Print Aid . &quot; &quot; And here &apos;s how it might work .
Provided it saw little inflation risk from doing so , the central bank would be mandated to match the government &apos;s overseas aid payments up to a certain limit .
Governments have been aiming to get aid to 0.7 percent for years , so let &apos;s set the limit at half of that , 0.35 percent of their income .
So it would work like this : If in a given year the government gave 0.2 percent of its income to overseas aid , the central bank would simply top it up with a further 0.2 percent .
So far so good .
How risky is this ?
Well , this involves the creation of money to buy goods , not assets .
It sounds more inflationary already , doesn &apos;t it .
But there are two important mitigating factors here .
The first is that by definition , this money printed would be spent overseas .
So it &apos;s not obvious how it leads to inflation in the country doing the actual printing unless it leads to a currency depreciation of that country .
That is unlikely for the second reason : the scale of the money that would be printed under this scheme .
So let &apos;s think of an example where Print Aid was in place in the U.S. , U.K. and Japan .
To match the aid payments made by those governments over the last four years , Print Aid would have generated 200 billion dollars &apos; worth of extra aid .
What would that look like in the context of the increase in the money stock that had already happened in those countries to save the financial system ?
Are you read for this ?
You might struggle to see that at the back , because the gap is quite small .
So what we &apos;re saying here is that we took a $ 3.7 trillion gamble to save our financial systems , and you know what , it paid off .
There was no inflation .
Are we really saying that it &apos;s not worth the risk to print an extra 200 billion for aid ?
Would the risks really be that different ?
To me , it &apos;s not that clear .
What is clear is the impact on aid .
Aid as a proportion of national income all of a sudden is at a 40-year high .
Now , we don &apos;t get to 0.7 percent .
Governments are still incentivized to give .
But you know what , that &apos;s the point of a matching scheme .
So I think what we &apos;ve learned is that the risks from this money creation scheme are quite modest , but the benefits are potentially huge .
Imagine what we could do with 40 percent more funding .
We might be able to feed the front row .
Today , money creation by central banks is an accepted policy tool .
That may not always be the case .
Today there are universally agreed aims for international aid .
That may not always be the case .
Today might be the only time that these two things coincide , such that we can afford the aid that we &apos;ve always aspired to give .
I seriously believe the question should be , why not ?
Thank you very much .

I have been teaching for a long time , and in doing so have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning that I really wish more people would understand about the potential of students .
In 1931 , my grandmother — bottom left for you guys over here — graduated from the eighth grade .
She went to school to get the information because that &apos;s where the information lived .
It was in the books ; it was inside the teacher &apos;s head ; and she needed to go there to get the information , because that &apos;s how you learned .
Fast-forward a generation : this is the one-room schoolhouse , Oak Grove , where my father went to a one-room schoolhouse .
And he again had to travel to the school to get the information from the teacher , stored it in the only portable memory he has , which is inside his own head , and take it with him , because that is how information was being transported from teacher to student and then used in the world .
When I was a kid , we had a set of encyclopedias at my house .
It was purchased the year I was born , and it was extraordinary , because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information .
The information was inside my house and it was awesome .
This was different than either generation had experienced before , and it changed the way I interacted with information even at just a small level .
But the information was closer to me .
I could get access to it .
In the time that passes between when I was a kid in high school and when I started teaching , we really see the advent of the Internet .
Right about the time that the Internet gets going as an educational tool , I take off from Wisconsin and move to Kansas , small town Kansas , where I had an opportunity to teach in a lovely , small-town , rural Kansas school district , where I was teaching my favorite subject , American government .
My first year — super gung-ho — going to teach American government , loved the political system .
Kids in the 12th grade : not exactly all that enthusiastic about the American government system .
Year two : learned a few things — had to change my tactic .
And I put in front of them an authentic experience that allowed them to learn for themselves .
I didn &apos;t tell them what to do or how to do it .
I posed a problem in front of them , which was to put on an election forum for their own community .
They produced flyers . They called offices .
They checked schedules . They were meeting with secretaries .
They produced an election forum booklet for the entire town to learn more about their candidates .
They invited everyone into the school for an evening of conversation about government and politics and whether or not the streets were done well , and really had this robust experiential learning .
The older teachers — more experienced — looked at me and went , &quot; Oh , there she is . That &apos;s so cute . She &apos;s trying to get that done . &quot;
( Laughter ) &quot; She doesn &apos;t know what she &apos;s in for . &quot;
But I knew that the kids would show up , and I believed it , and I told them every week what I expected out of them .
And that night , all 90 kids — dressed appropriately , doing their job , owning it .
I had to just sit and watch .
It was theirs . It was experiential . It was authentic .
It meant something to them .
And they will step up .
From Kansas , I moved on to lovely Arizona , where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years , this time with middle school students .
Luckily , I didn &apos;t have to teach them American government .
Could teach them the more exciting topic of geography .
Again , &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; to learn .
But what was interesting about this position I found myself in in Arizona , was I had this really extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with in a truly public school , and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities .
And one opportunity was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina , which is the gentleman that the movie &quot; &quot; Hotel Rwanda &quot; &quot; is based after .
And he was going to speak at the high school next door to us .
We could walk there . We didn &apos;t even have to pay for the buses .
There was no expense cost . Perfect field trip .
The problem then becomes how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful , and they know what to do with it .
And so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina as an example of a gentleman who singularly used his life to do something positive .
I then challenged the kids to identify someone in their own life , or in their own story , or in their own world , that they could identify that had done a similar thing .
I asked them to produce a little movie about it .
It &apos;s the first time we &apos;d done this .
Nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer , but they were into it . And I asked them to put their own voice over it .
It was the most awesome moment of revelation that when you ask kids to use their own voice and ask them to speak for themselves , what they &apos;re willing to share .
The last question of the assignment is : how do you plan to use your life to positively impact other people ?
The things that kids will say when you ask them and take the time to listen is extraordinary .
Fast-forward to Pennsylvania , where I find myself today .
I teach at the Science Leadership Academy , which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute and the school district of Philadelphia .
We are a nine through 12 public school , but we do school quite differently .
I moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that I knew that kids learned , and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you are willing to let go of some of the paradigms of the past , of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when I was in school , and to a moment when we have information surplus .
So what do you do when the information is all around you ?
Why do you have kids come to school if they no longer have to come there to get the information ?
In Philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program , so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday , taking them home , getting access to information .
And here &apos;s the thing that you need to get comfortable with when you &apos;ve given the tool to acquire information to students , is that you have to be comfortable with this idea of allowing kids to fail as part of the learning process .
We deal right now in the educational landscape with an infatuation with the culture of one right answer that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test , and I am here to share with you : it is not learning .
That is the absolute wrong thing to ask , to tell kids to never be wrong .
To ask them to always have the right answer doesn &apos;t allow them to learn .
So we did this project , and this is one of the artifacts of the project .
I almost never show them off because of the issue of the idea of failure .
My students produced these info-graphics as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year responding to the oil spill .
I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing of the info-graphics that existed in a lot of mass media , and take a look at what were the interesting components of it , and produce one for themselves of a different man-made disaster from American history .
And they had certain criteria to do it .
They were a little uncomfortable with it , because we &apos;d never done this before , and they didn &apos;t know exactly how to do it .
They can talk — they &apos;re very smooth , and they can write very , very well , but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way was a little uncomfortable for them .
But I gave them the room to just do the thing .
Go create . Go figure it out .
Let &apos;s see what we can do .
And the student that persistently turns out the best visual product did not disappoint .
This was done in like two or three days .
And this is the work of the student that consistently did it .
And when I sat the students down , I said , &quot; &quot; Who &apos;s got the best one ? &quot; &quot; And they immediately went , &quot; &quot; There it is . &quot; &quot; Didn &apos;t read anything . &quot; &quot; There it is . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well what makes it great ? &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Oh , the design &apos;s good , and he &apos;s using good color .
And there &apos;s some ... &quot; &quot; And they went through all that we processed out loud .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Go read it . &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Oh , that one wasn &apos;t so awesome . &quot; &quot; And then we went to another one — it didn &apos;t have great visuals , but it had great information — and spent an hour talking about the learning process , because it wasn &apos;t about whether or not it was perfect , or whether or not it was what I could create .
It asked them to create for themselves , and it allowed them to fail , process , learn from .
And when we do another round of this in my class this year , they will do better this time , because learning has to include an amount of failure , because failure is instructional in the process .
There are a million pictures that I could click through here , and had to choose carefully — this is one of my favorites — of students learning , of what learning can look like in a landscape where we let go of the idea that kids have to come to school to get the information , but instead , ask them what they can do with it .
Ask them really interesting questions .
They will not disappoint .
Ask them to go to places , to see things for themselves , to actually experience the learning , to play , to inquire .
This is one of my favorite photos , because this was taken on Tuesday , when I asked the students to go to the polls .
This is Robbie , and this was his first day of voting , and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that .
But this is learning too , because we asked them to go out into real spaces .
The main point is that , if we continue to look at education as if it &apos;s about coming to school to get the information and not about experiential learning , empowering student voice and embracing failure , we &apos;re missing the mark .
And everything that everybody is talking about today isn &apos;t possible if we keep having an educational system that does not value these qualities , because we won &apos;t get there with a standardized test , and we won &apos;t get there with a culture of one right answer .
We know how to do this better , and it &apos;s time to do better .
( Applause )
Let me start by asking you a question , just with a show of hands : Who has an iPhone ?
Who has an Android phone ?
Who has a Blackberry ?
I &apos;ll bet you didn &apos;t even know you &apos;re using African technology .
Pay-as-you-go was a technology , or an idea , pioneered in Africa by a company called Vodacom a good 15 years ago , and now , like franchising , pay-as-you-go is one of the most dominant forces of economic activity in the world .
So I &apos;m going to talk about innovation in Africa , which I think is the purest form , innovation out of necessity .
But first , I &apos;m going to ask you some other questions .
You don &apos;t have to put your hands up .
These are rhetorical .
Why did Nikola Tesla have to invent the alternating current that powers the lights in this building or the city that we &apos;re in ?
And why did Eric Merrifield have to invent the dolos ?
Blank stares . That is what a dolos looks like , and in the background , you can see Robben Island .
This is a small dolos , and Eric Merrifield is the most famous inventor you &apos;ve never heard of .
In 1963 , a storm ripped up the harbor in a small South African town called East London , and while he was watching his kids playing with toys made from oxen bones called dolosse , he had the idea for this .
It &apos;s a bit like a huge jumping jack , and they have used this in every harbor in the world as a breakwater .
The global shipping economy would not be possible without African technology like this .
So whenever you talk about Africa , you have to put up this picture of the world from space , and people go , &quot; &quot; Look , it &apos;s the Dark Continent . &quot; &quot; Actually , it isn &apos;t .
What it is is a map of innovation .
All the places with lots of electricity , it isn &apos;t .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And the reason it isn &apos;t is because everybody &apos;s watching television or playing Angry Birds . ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
Now , this is real innovation , not the way people have expropriated the word to talk about launching new products .
This is real innovation , and I define it as problem-solving .
People are solving real problems in Africa .
Why ? Because we have to .
Because we have real problems .
And when we solve real problems for people , we solve them for the rest of the world at the same time .
So in California , everybody &apos;s really excited about a little square of plastic that you plug into a phone and you can swipe your credit card , and people say , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve liberated the credit card from the point of sale terminal . &quot; &quot; Fantastic . Why do you even need a credit card ?
In Africa , we &apos;ve been doing that for years , and we &apos;ve been doing it on phones like this .
This is a picture I took at a place called Kitengela , about an hour south of Nairobi , and the thing that &apos;s so remarkable about the payment system that &apos;s been pioneered in Africa called M-Pesa is that it works on phones like this .
It works on every single phone possible , because it uses SMS .
You can pay bills with it , you can buy your groceries , you can pay your kids &apos; school fees , and I &apos;m told you can even bribe customs officials .
( Laughter ) Something like 25 million dollars a day is transacted through M-Pesa .
Forty percent of Kenya &apos;s GDP moves through M-Pesa using phones like this .
And you think this is just a feature phone .
It &apos;s also a radio , and it &apos;s also a torch , and more than anything else , it has really superb battery life .
Why ? Because that &apos;s what we need .
We have really severe energy problems in Africa .
By the way , you can update Facebook and send Gmail from a phone like this .
And the difference today is that the gold of today is mobile .
If you think about the railroad system in North America and how that worked , first came the infrastructure , then came the industry around it , the brothels — it &apos;s a bit like the Internet today , right ? — and everything else that worked with it : bars , saloons , etc .
The gold of today is mobile , and mobile is the enabler that makes all of this possible .
So what are some of the things that you can do with it ?
Well , this is by a guy called Bright Simons from Ghana , and what you do is you take medication , something that some people might spend their entire month &apos;s salary on , and you scratch off the code , and you send that to an SMS number , and it tells you if that is legitimate or if it &apos;s expired .
In Kenya , there &apos;s a service called iCow , which just sends you really important information about how to look after your dairy .
And if you can do that , you can rise out of poverty .
Really simple , using a basic phone .
If you don &apos;t have electricity , no problem !
We &apos;ll just make it out of old bicycle parts using a windmill , as William Kamkwamba did .
There &apos;s another great African that you &apos;ve heard that &apos;s busy disrupting the automobile industry in the world .
He &apos;s also finding a way to reinvent solar power and the electricity industry in North America , and if he &apos;s lucky , he &apos;ll get us to Mars , hopefully in my lifetime .
He comes from Pretoria , the capital of &#91; South Africa &#93; , about 50 kilometers from where I live .
So back to Joburg , which is sometimes called Egoli , which means City of Gold .
And not only is mobile the gold of today , I don &apos;t believe that the gold is under the ground .
I believe we are the gold .
Like you &apos;ve heard the other economists say , we are at the point where China was when its boom years began , and that &apos;s where we &apos;re going .
So , you hear the West talk about innovation at the edge .
Well , of course it &apos;s happening at the edge , because in the middle , everybody &apos;s updating Facebook , or worse still , they &apos;re trying to understand Facebook &apos;s privacy settings .
( Laughter ) This is not that catchy catchphrase .
This is innovation over the edge .
So , people like to call Africa a mobile-first continent , but actually it &apos;s mobile-only , so while everybody else is doing all of those things , we &apos;re solving the world &apos;s problems .
So there &apos;s only one thing left to say .
&#91; &quot; &quot; You &apos;re welcome &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
Now ...
let &apos;s go back in time .
It &apos;s 1974 .
There is the gallery somewhere in the world , and there is a young girl , age 23 , standing in the middle of the space .
In the front of her is a table .
On the table there are 76 objects for pleasure and for pain .
Some of the objects are a glass of water , a coat , a shoe , a rose .
But also the knife , the razor blade , the hammer and the pistol with one bullet .
There are instructions which say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m an object .
You can use everything on the table on me .
I &apos;m taking all responsibility — even killing me .
And the time is six hours . &quot; &quot; The beginning of this performance was easy .
People would give me the glass of water to drink , they &apos;d give me the rose .
But very soon after , there was a man who took the scissors and cut my clothes , and then they took the thorns of the rose and stuck them in my stomach .
Somebody took the razor blade and cut my neck and drank the blood , and I still have the scar .
The women would tell the men what to do .
And the men didn &apos;t rape me because it was just a normal opening , and it was all public , and they were with their wives .
And another person took the pistol and they started a fight .
And after six hours were finished , I ...
started walking towards the public .
I was a mess .
I was half-naked , I was full of blood and tears were running down my face .
And everybody escaped , they just ran away .
They could not confront myself , with myself as a normal human being .
And then — what happened is I went to the hotel , it was at two in the morning . And
I looked at myself in the mirror , and I had a piece of gray hair .
Alright — please take off your blindfolds .
Welcome to the performance world .
First of all , let &apos;s explain what the performance is .
So many artists , so many different explanations , but my explanation for performance is very simple .
Performance is a mental and physical construction that the performer makes in a specific time in a space in front of an audience and then energy dialogue happens .
The audience and the performer make the piece together .
And the difference between performance and theater is huge .
In the theater , the knife is not a knife and the blood is just ketchup .
In the performance , the blood is the material , and the razor blade or knife is the tool .
It &apos;s all about being there in the real time , and you can &apos;t rehearse performance , because you can &apos;t do many of these types of things twice — ever .
Which is very important , the performance is — you know , all human beings are always afraid of very simple things .
We &apos;re afraid of suffering , we &apos;re afraid of pain , we &apos;re afraid of mortality .
So what I &apos;m doing — I &apos;m staging these kinds of fears in front of the audience .
I &apos;m using your energy , and with this energy I can go and push my body as far as I can .
And then I liberate myself from these fears .
And I &apos;m your mirror .
If I can do this for myself , you can do it for you .
After Belgrade , where I was born , I went to Amsterdam .
And you know , I &apos;ve been doing performances since the last 40 years .
And here I met Ulay , and he was the person I actually fell in love with .
And we made , for 12 years , performances together .
You know the knife and the pistols and the bullets , I exchange into love and trust .
So to do this kind work you have to trust the person completely because this arrow is pointing to my heart .
So , heart beating and adrenaline is rushing and so on , is about trust , is about total trust to another human being .
Our relationship was 12 years , and we worked on so many subjects , both male and female energy .
And as every relationship comes to an end , ours went too .
We didn &apos;t make phone calls like normal human beings do and say , you know , &quot; &quot; This is over . &quot; &quot; We walked the Great Wall of China to say goodbye .
I started at the Yellow Sea , and he started from the Gobi Desert .
We walked , each of us , three months , two and a half thousand kilometers .
It was the mountains , it was difficult .
It was climbing , it was ruins .
It was , you know , going through the 12 Chinese provinces , this was before China was open in &apos; 87 .
And we succeeded to meet in the middle to say goodbye .
And then our relationship stopped .
And now , it completely changed how I see the public .
And one very important piece I made in those days was &quot; &quot; Balkan Baroque . &quot; &quot; And this was the time of the Balkan Wars , and I wanted to create some very strong , charismatic image , something that could serve for any war at any time , because the Balkan Wars are now finished , but there &apos;s always some war , somewhere .
So here I am washing two and a half thousand dead , big , bloody cow bones .
You can &apos;t wash the blood , you never can wash shame off the wars .
So I &apos;m washing this six hours , six days , and wars are coming off these bones , and becoming possible — an unbearable smell .
But then something stays in the memory .
But the need of people to actually experience something different , the public was not anymore the group — relation was one to one .
I was watching these people , they would come and sit in front of me , but they would have to wait for hours and hours and hours to get to this position , and finally , they sit .
And what happened ?
They are observed by the other people , they &apos;re photographed , they &apos;re filmed by the camera , they &apos;re observed by me and they have nowhere to escape except in themselves .
And that makes a difference .
And I understood when I stood up from that chair after three months , I am not the same anymore .
And I understood that I have a very strong mission , that I have to communicate this experience to everybody .
And this is how , for me , was born the idea to have an institute of immaterial performing arts .
It &apos;s not like a painting .
You have the painting on the wall , the next day it &apos;s there .
And then after this is performance , and then everything else .
That &apos;s my subjective way .
This institute is going to happen in Hudson , upstate New York , and we are trying to build with Rem Koolhaas , an idea .
If you want to get experience , you have to give me your time .
You have to sign the contract before you enter the building , that you will spend there a full six hours , you have to give me your word of honor .
It &apos;s something so old-fashioned , but if you don &apos;t respect your own word of honor and you leave before — that &apos;s not my problem .
The public comes in , and the first thing you have to do is dress in lab coats .
It &apos;s this importance of stepping from being just a viewer into experimenter .
And then you go to the lockers and you put your watch , your iPhone , your iPod , your computer and everything digital , electronic .
And you are getting free time for yourself for the first time .
Because there is nothing wrong with technology , our approach to technology is wrong .
We are losing the time we have for ourselves .
This is an institute to actually give you back this time .
So what you do here , first you start slow walking , you start slowing down .
You &apos;re going back to simplicity .
After slow walking , you &apos;re going to learn how to drink water — very simple , drinking water for maybe half an hour .
After this , you &apos;re going to the magnet chamber , where you &apos;re going to create some magnet streams on your body .
Then after this , you go to crystal chamber .
After crystal chamber , you go to eye-gazing chamber , after eye-gazing chamber , you go to a chamber where you are lying down .
So it &apos;s the three basic positions of the human body , sitting , standing and lying .
And there is a sound chamber .
It can be music , it can be opera , it can be a theater piece , it can be film , it can be video dance .
You go to the long duration chairs because now you are comfortable .
And if you fall asleep , which is very possible because it &apos;s been a long day , you &apos;re going to be transported to the parking lot .
( Laughter ) And you know , sleeping is very important .
In sleeping , you &apos;re still receiving art .
So in the parking lot you stay for a certain amount of time , and then after this you just , you know , go back , you see more of the things you like to see or go home with your certificate .
So this institute right now is virtual .
Right now , I am just making my institute in Brazil , then it &apos;s going to be in Australia , then it &apos;s coming here , to Canada and everywhere .
And this is to experience a kind of simple method , how you go back to simplicity in your own life .
Counting rice will be another thing .
( Laughter ) You know , if you count rice you can make life , too .
How to count rice for six hours ?
It &apos;s incredibly important .
You know , you go through this whole range of being bored , being angry , being completely frustrated , not finishing the amount of rice you &apos;re counting .
And then this unbelievable amount of peace you get when satisfying work is finished — or counting sand in the desert .
Or having the sound-isolated situation — that you have headphones , that you don &apos;t hear anything , and you &apos;re just there together without sound , with the people experiencing silence , just the simple silence .
We are always doing things we like in our life .
And this is why you &apos;re not changing .
You do things in life — it &apos;s just nothing happens if you always do things the same way .
But my method is to do things I &apos;m afraid of , the things I fear , the things I don &apos;t know , to go to territory that nobody &apos;s ever been .
And then also to include the failure .
I think failure is important because if you go , if you experiment , you can fail .
If you don &apos;t go into that area and you don &apos;t fail , you are actually repeating yourself over and over again .
And I think that human beings right now need a change , and the only change to be made is a personal level change .
You have to make the change on yourself .
Because the only way to change consciousness and to change the world around us , is to start with yourself .
But what we do on the personal level — what is our contribution to this whole thing ?
Can you turn to your neighbor , the one you don &apos;t know , and look at them for two full minutes in their eyes , right now ?
( Chatter ) I &apos;m asking two minutes of your time , that &apos;s so little .
Breathe slowly , don &apos;t try to blink , don &apos;t be self-conscious .
Be relaxed .
And just look a complete stranger in your eyes , in his eyes .
( Silence ) Thank you for trusting me .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : Thank you .
Thank you so much .
Humanity takes center stage at TED , but I would like to add a voice for the animals , whose bodies and minds and spirits shaped us .
Some years ago , it was my good fortune to meet a tribal elder on an island not far from Vancouver .
His name is Jimmy Smith , and he shared a story with me that is told among his people , who call themselves the Kwikwasut &apos;inuxw .
Once upon a time , he told me , all animals on Earth were one .
Even though they look different on the outside , inside , they &apos;re all the same , and from time to time they would gather at a sacred cave deep inside the forest to celebrate their unity .
Raven shed his feathers , bear his fur , and salmon her scales , and then , they would dance .
But one day , a human made it to the cave and laughed at what he saw because he did not understand .
Embarrassed , the animals fled , and that was the last time they revealed themselves this way .
I like to get past the fur , the feathers and the scales .
I want to get under the skin .
No matter whether I &apos;m facing a giant elephant or a tiny tree frog , my goal is to connect us with them , eye to eye .
You may wonder , do I ever photograph people ?
You just have to learn how to look past their disguise .
When I use my camera , I drop my skin like the animals at that cave so I can show who they really are .
As animals blessed with the power of rational thought , we can marvel at the intricacies of life .
As citizens of a planet in trouble , it is our moral responsibility to deal with the dramatic loss in diversity of life .
Let &apos;s find a way to join the dance .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Francesca Fedeli : Ciao .
So he &apos;s Mario . He &apos;s our son .
He was born two and a half years ago , and I had a pretty tough pregnancy because I had to stay still in a bed for , like , eight months .
But in the end everything seemed to be under control .
So he got the right weight at birth .
He got the right Apgar index .
So we were pretty reassured by this .
But at the end , 10 days later after he was born , we discovered that he had a stroke .
As you might know , a stroke is a brain injury .
A perinatal stroke could be something that can happen during the nine months of pregnancy or just suddenly after the birth , and in his case , as you can see , the right part of his brain has gone .
So the effect that this stroke could have on Mario &apos;s body could be the fact that he couldn &apos;t be able to control the left side of his body .
Just imagine , if you have a computer and a printer and you want to transmit , to input to print out a document , but the printer doesn &apos;t have the right drives , so the same is for Mario .
It &apos;s just like , he would like to move his left side of his body , but he &apos;s not able to transmit the right input to move his left arm and left leg .
So life had to change .
We needed to change our schedule .
We needed to change the impact that this birth had on our life .
Roberto D &apos;Angelo : As you may imagine , unfortunately , we were not ready .
Nobody taught us how to deal with such kinds of disabilities , and as many questions as possible started to come to our minds .
And that has been really a tough time .
Questions , some basics , like , you know , why did this happen to us ?
And what went wrong ?
Some more tough , like , really , what will be the impact on Mario &apos;s life ?
I mean , at the end , will he be able to work ?
And this , indeed , really is tough to say , but a few months later , we realized that we were really feeling like a failure .
I mean , the only real product of our life , at the end , was a failure .
And you know , it was not a failure for ourselves in itself , but it was a failure that will impact his full life .
Honestly , we went down .
I mean we went really down , but at the end , we started to look at him , and we said , we have to react .
So immediately , as Francesca said , we changed our life .
Basically , we spent months doing this with Mario .
You have an object , and we showed him how to grab the object .
Now , the theory of mirror neurons simply says that in your brains , exactly now , as you watch me doing this , you are activating exactly the same neurons as if you do the actions .
It looks like this is the leading edge in terms of rehabilitation .
But one day we found that Mario was not looking at our hand .
He was looking at us .
We were his mirror .
And the problem , as you might feel , is that we were down , we were depressed , we were looking at him as a problem , not as a son , not from a positive perspective .
And that day really changed our perspective .
We realized that we had to become a better mirror for Mario .
We restarted from our strengths , and at the same time we restarted from his strengths .
We stopped looking at him as a problem , and we started to look at him as an opportunity to improve .
And really , this was the change , and from our side , we said , &quot; What are our strengths that we really can bring to Mario ? &quot;
And we started from our passions .
We love to travel , we love music , we love to be in places like this , and we started to bring Mario with us just to show to him the best things that we can show to him .
This short video is from last week .
But we want to share what was the key learning , the key learning that Mario drove to us , and it is to consider what you have as a gift and not only what you miss , and to consider what you miss just as an opportunity .
And this is the message that we want to share with you .
Mario !
And this is why — ( Applause ) — And this is why we decided to share the best mirror in the world with him .
And we thank you so much , all of you .
FF : Thank you . RD : Thank you . Bye .
( Applause ) FF : Thank you . ( Applause )
I work with a species called &quot; &quot; Bonobo . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m happy most of the time , because I think this is the happiest species on the planet .
It &apos;s kind of a well-kept secret .
This species lives only in the Congo .
And they &apos;re not in too many zoos , because of their sexual behavior .
Their sexual behavior is too human-like for most of us to be comfortable with .
( Laughter ) But — ( Laughter ) actually , we have a lot to learn from them , because they &apos;re a very egalitarian society and they &apos;re a very empathetic society .
And sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life that they sort of set aside .
It permeates their entire life .
And it &apos;s used for communication .
And it &apos;s used for conflict resolution .
And I think perhaps somewhere in our history we sort of , divided our lives up into lots of parts .
We divided our world up with lots of categories .
And so everything sort of has a place that it has to fit .
But I don &apos;t think that we were that way initially .
There are many people who think that the animal world is hard-wired and that there &apos;s something very , very special about man .
Maybe it &apos;s his ability to have causal thought .
Maybe it &apos;s something special in his brain that allows him to have language . Maybe it &apos;s something special in his brain
that allows him to make tools or to have mathematics .
Well , I don &apos;t know . There were Tasmanians who were discovered around the 1600s and they had no fire .
They had no stone tools .
To our knowledge they had no music .
So when you compare them to the Bonobo , the Bonobo is a little hairier .
He doesn &apos;t stand quite as upright .
But there are a lot of similarities .
And I think that as we look at culture , we kind of come to understand how we got to where we are .
And I don &apos;t really think it &apos;s in our biology ; I think we &apos;ve attributed it to our biology , but I don &apos;t really think it &apos;s there .
So what I want to do now is introduce you to a species called the Bonobo .
This is Kanzi .
He &apos;s a Bonobo .
Right now , he &apos;s in a forest in Georgia .
His mother originally came from a forest in Africa .
And she came to us when she was just at puberty , about six or seven years of age .
Now this shows a Bonobo on your right , and a chimpanzee on your left .
Clearly , the chimpanzee has a little bit harder time of walking .
The Bonobo , although shorter than us and their arms still longer , is more upright , just as we are .
This shows the Bonobo compared to an australopithecine like Lucy .
As you can see , there &apos;s not a lot of difference between the way a Bonobo walks and the way an early australopithecine would have walked .
As they turn toward us you &apos;ll see that the pelvic area of early australopithecines is a little flatter and doesn &apos;t have to rotate quite so much from side to side .
So the — the bipedal gait is a little easier .
And now we see all four .
Video : Narrator : The wild Bonobo lives in central Africa , in the jungle encircled by the Congo River .
Canopied trees as tall as 40 meters , 130 feet , grow densely in the area .
It was a Japanese scientist who first undertook serious field studies of the Bonobo , almost three decades ago .
Bonobos are built slightly smaller than the chimpanzee .
Slim-bodied , Bonobos are by nature very gentle creatures .
Long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them .
One discovery was that wild Bonobos often walk bidpedally .
What &apos;s more , they are able to walk upright for long distances .
Susan Savage-Rumbaugh ( video ) : Let &apos;s go say hello to Austin first and then go to the A frame .
SS : This is Kanzi and I , in the forest .
None of the things you will see in this particular video are trained .
None of them are tricks .
They all happened to be captured on film spontaneously , by NHK of Japan .
We have eight Bonobos .
Video : Look at all this stuff that &apos;s here for our campfire .
SS : An entire family at our research centre .
Video : You going to help get some sticks ?
Good .
We need more sticks , too .
I have a lighter in my pocket if you need one .
That &apos;s a wasps &apos; nest .
You can get it out .
I hope I have a lighter .
You can use the lighter to start the fire .
SS : So Kanzi is very interested in fire .
He doesn &apos;t do it yet without a lighter , but I think if he saw someone do it , he might be able to do — make a fire without a lighter .
He &apos;s learning about how to keep a fire going .
He &apos;s learning the uses for a fire , just by watching what we do with fire .
( Laughter ) This is a smile on the face of a Bonobo .
These are happy vocalizations .
Video : You &apos;re happy .
You &apos;re very happy about this part .
You &apos;ve got to put some water on the fire . You see the water ?
Good job .
SS : Forgot to zip up the back half of his backpack .
But he likes to carry things from place to place .
Video : Austin , I hear you saying &quot; &quot; Austin . &quot; &quot; SS : He talks to other Bonobos at the lab , long-distance , farther than we can hear .
This is his sister .
This is her first time to try to drive a golf cart .
Video : Goodbye .
( Laughter ) SS : She &apos;s got the pedals down , but not the wheel .
She switches from reverse to forward and she holds onto the wheel , rather than turns it .
( Laughter ) Like us , she knows that that individual in the mirror is her .
( Music ) Video : Narrator : By raising Bonobos in a culture that is both Bonobo and human , and documenting their development across two decades , scientists are exploring how cultural forces ( Laughter ) may have operated during human evolution .
His name is Nyota .
It means &quot; &quot; star &quot; &quot; in Swahili .
( Music ) Panbanisha is trying to give Nyota a haircut with a pair of scissors .
In the wild , the parent Bonobo is known to groom its offspring .
Here Panbanisha uses scissors , instead of her hands , to groom Nyota .
Very impressive .
Subtle maneuvering of the hands is required to perform delicate tasks like this .
Nyota tries to imitate Panbanisha by using the scissors himself .
Realizing that Nyota might get hurt , Panbanisha , like any human mother , carefully tugs to get the scissors back .
He can now cut through tough animal hide .
SS : Kanzi &apos;s learned to make stone tools .
Video : Kanzi now makes his tools , just as our ancestors may have made them , two-and-a-half million years ago — by holding the rocks in both hands , to strike one against the other .
He has learned that by using both hands and aiming his glancing blows , he can make much larger , sharper flakes .
Kanzi chooses a flake he thinks is sharp enough .
The tough hide is difficult to cut , even with a knife .
The rock that Kanzi is using is extremely hard and ideal for stone tool making , but difficult to handle , requiring great skill .
Kanzi &apos;s rock is from Gona , Ethiopia and is identical to that used by our African ancestors two-and-a-half million years ago .
These are the rocks Kanzi used and these are the flakes he made .
The flat sharp edges are like knife blades .
Compare them to the tools our ancestors used ; they bear a striking resemblance to Kanzi &apos;s .
Panbanisha is longing to go for a walk in the woods .
She keeps staring out the window .
SS : This is — let me show you something we didn &apos;t think they would do .
Video : For several days now , Panbanisha has not been outside .
SS : I normally talk about language .
Video : Then Panbanisha does something unexpected .
SS : But since I &apos;m advised not to do what I normally do , I haven &apos;t told you that these apes have language .
It &apos;s a geometric language .
Video : She takes a piece of chalk and begins writing something on the floor .
What is she writing ?
SS : She &apos;s also saying the name of that , with her voice .
Video : Now she comes up to Dr. Sue and starts writing again .
SS : These are her symbols on her keyboard .
( Music ) They speak when she touches them .
Video : Panbanisha is communicating to Dr. Sue where she wants to go .
&quot; &quot; A frame &quot; &quot; represents a hut in the woods .
Compare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard .
Panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor .
SS ( video ) : Very nice . Beautiful , Panbanisha .
SS : At first we didn &apos;t really realize what she was doing , until we stood back and looked at it and rotated it .
Video : This lexigram also refers to a place in the woods .
The curved line is very similar to the lexigram .
The next symbol Panbanisha writes represents &quot; &quot; collar . &quot; &quot; It indicates the collar that Panbanisha must wear when she goes out .
SS : That &apos;s an institutional requirement .
Video : This symbol is not as clear as the others , but one can see Panbanisha is trying to produce a curved line and several straight lines .
Researchers began to record what Panbanisha said , by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk .
Panbanisha watched .
Soon she began to write as well .
The Bonobo &apos;s abilities have stunned scientists around the world .
How did they develop ?
SS ( video ) : We found that the most important thing for permitting Bonobos to acquire language is not to teach them .
It &apos;s simply to use language around them , because the driving force in language acquisition is to understand what others , that are important to you , are saying to you .
Once you have that capacity , the ability to produce language comes rather naturally and rather freely .
So we want to create an environment in which Bonobos , like all of the individuals with whom they are interacting — we want to create an environment in which they have fun , and an environment in which the others are meaningful individuals for them .
Narrator : This environment brings out unexpected potential in Kanzi and Panbanisha .
Panbanisha is enjoying playing her harmonica , until Nyota , now one year old , steals it .
Then he peers eagerly into his mother &apos;s mouth .
Is he looking for where the sound came from ?
Dr. Sue thinks it &apos;s important to allow such curiosity to flourish .
This time Panbanisha is playing the electric piano .
She wasn &apos;t forced to learn the piano ; she saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest .
Researcher : Go ahead . Go ahead . I &apos;m listening .
Do that real fast part that you did . Yeah , that part .
Narrator : Kanzi plays the xylophone ; using both hands he enthusiastically accompanies Dr. Sue &apos;s singing .
Kanzi and Panbanisha are stimulated by this fun-filled environment , which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities .
( Laughter ) Researcher : OK , now get the monsters . Get them .
Take the cherries too .
Now watch out , stay away from them now .
Now you can chase them again . Time to chase them .
Now you have to stay away . Get away .
Run away . Run .
Now we can chase them again . Go get them .
Oh no !
Good Kanzi . Very good . Thank you so much .
Narrator : None of us , Bonobo or human , can possibly even imagine ?
SS : So we have a bi-species environment , we call it a &quot; &quot; panhomoculture . &quot; &quot; We &apos;re learning how to become like them .
We &apos;re learning how to communicate with them , in really high-pitched tones .
We &apos;re learning that they probably have a language in the wild .
And they &apos;re learning to become like us .
Because we believe that it &apos;s not biology ; it &apos;s culture .
So we &apos;re sharing tools and technology and language with another species .
Thank you .
Virtual reality started for me in sort of an unusual place .
It was the 1970s .
I got into the field very young : I was seven years old .
And the tool that I used to access virtual reality was the Evel Knievel stunt cycle .
This is a commercial for that particular item : ( Video ) Voice-over : What a jump !
Evel &apos;s riding the amazing stunt cycle .
That gyro-power sends him over 100 feet at top speed .
Chris Milk : So this was my joy back then .
I rode this motorcycle everywhere .
And I was there with Evel Knievel ; we jumped the Snake River Canyon together .
I wanted the rocket .
I never got the rocket , I only got the motorcycle .
I felt so connected to this world .
I didn &apos;t want to be a storyteller when I grew up , I wanted to be stuntman .
I was there . Evel Knievel was my friend .
I had so much empathy for him .
But it didn &apos;t work out . ( Laughter ) I went to art school .
I started making music videos .
Unfortunately , Evel Knievel did not feel the same empathy for us that we felt for him , and he sued us for this video — ( Laughter ) — shortly thereafter .
On the upside , the man that I worshipped as a child , the man that I wanted to become as an adult , I was finally able to get his autograph .
( Applause ) Let &apos;s talk about film now .
Film , it &apos;s an incredible medium , but essentially , it &apos;s the same now as it was then .
And we &apos;ve done incredible things with those rectangles .
And here &apos;s one of the early experiments : ( Music ) So this is called &quot; &quot; The Wilderness Downtown . &quot; &quot; It was a collaboration with Arcade Fire .
It asked you to put in the address where you grew up at the beginning of it .
It &apos;s a website .
And out of it starts growing these little boxes with different browser windows .
And you see this teenager running down a street , and then you see Google Street View and Google Maps imagery and you realize the street he &apos;s running down is yours .
And when he stops in front of a house , he stops in front of your house .
And this was great , and I saw people having an even deeper emotional reaction to this than the things that I had made in rectangles .
And I &apos;m essentially taking a piece of your history and putting it inside the framing of the story .
But then I started thinking , okay , well that &apos;s a part of you , but how do I put all of you inside of the frame ?
So to do that , I started making art installations .
And this is one called &quot; &quot; The Treachery of Sanctuary . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a triptych . I &apos;m going to show you the third panel .
But then I started thinking about frames , and what do they represent ?
I mean , all the media that we watch — television , cinema — they &apos;re these windows into these other worlds .
And I thought , well , great . I got you in a frame .
So that leads me back to virtual reality .
Let &apos;s talk about virtual reality .
Unfortunately , talking about virtual reality is like dancing about architecture .
( Laughter ) So , it &apos;s difficult to explain . Why is it difficult to explain ?
It &apos;s difficult because it &apos;s a very experiential medium .
You feel your way inside of it .
It &apos;s a machine , but inside of it , it feels like real life , it feels like truth .
And you feel present in the world that you &apos;re inside and you feel present with the people that you &apos;re inside of it with .
So , I &apos;m going to show you a demo of a virtual reality film : a full-screen version of all the information that we capture when we shoot virtual reality .
So we &apos;re shooting in every direction .
This is a camera system that we built that has 3D cameras that look in every direction and binaural microphones that face in every direction .
We take this and we build , basically , a sphere of a world that you inhabit .
So what I &apos;m going to show you is not a view into the world , it &apos;s basically the whole world stretched into a rectangle .
So this film is called &quot; &quot; Clouds Over Sidra , &quot; &quot; and it was made in conjunction with our virtual reality company called VRSE and the United Nations , and a co-collaborator named Gabo Arora .
And she and her family fled Syria through the desert into Jordan and she &apos;s been living in this camp for the last year and a half .
( Video ) Sidra : My name is Sidra .
I am 12 years old .
I am in the fifth grade .
I am from Syria , in the Daraa Province , Inkhil City .
I have lived here in the Zaatari camp in Jordan for the last year and a half .
I have a big family : three brothers , one is a baby .
He cries a lot .
I asked my father if I cried when I was a baby and he says I did not .
I think I was a stronger baby than my brother .
CM : So , when you &apos;re inside of the headset .
you &apos;re not seeing it like this .
You &apos;re looking around through this world .
You &apos;ll notice you see full 360 degrees , in all directions .
And when you &apos;re sitting there in her room , watching her , you &apos;re not watching it through a television screen , you &apos;re not watching it through a window , you &apos;re sitting there with her .
When you look down , you &apos;re sitting on the same ground that she &apos;s sitting on .
And because of that , you feel her humanity in a deeper way .
You empathize with her in a deeper way .
And I think that we can change minds with this machine .
And we &apos;ve already started to try to change a few .
So we took this film to the World Economic Forum in Davos in January .
And we showed it to a group of people whose decisions affect the lives of millions of people .
And these are people who might not otherwise be sitting in a tent in a refugee camp in Jordan .
But in January , one afternoon in Switzerland , they suddenly all found themselves there .
( Applause ) And they were affected by it .
So we &apos;re going to make more of them .
We &apos;re working with the United Nations right now to shoot a whole series of these films .
We just finished shooting a story in Liberia .
And now , we &apos;re going to shoot a story in India .
And we &apos;re taking these films , and we &apos;re showing them at the United Nations to people that work there and people that are visiting there .
And we &apos;re showing them to the people that can actually change the lives of the people inside of the films .
And that &apos;s where I think we just start to scratch the surface of the true power of virtual reality .
It &apos;s not a video game peripheral .
It connects humans to other humans in a profound way that I &apos;ve never seen before in any other form of media .
And it can change people &apos;s perception of each other .
And that &apos;s how I think virtual reality has the potential to actually change the world .
So , it &apos;s a machine , but through this machine we become more compassionate , we become more empathetic , and we become more connected .
And ultimately , we become more human .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to talk to you today about hopefully converting fear into hope .
When we go to the physician today — when we go to the doctor &apos;s office and we walk in , there are words that we just don &apos;t want to hear .
There are words that we &apos;re truly afraid of .
Diabetes , cancer , Parkinson &apos;s , Alzheimer &apos;s , heart failure , lung failure — things that we know are debilitating diseases , for which there &apos;s relatively little that can be done .
And what I want to lay out for you today is a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease , why it &apos;s important , why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down if you think it already hasn &apos;t , and where we are clinically today , and where we might go tomorrow , and what some of the hurdles are .
And we &apos;re going to do all of that in 18 minutes , I promise .
I want to start with this slide , because this slide sort of tells the story the way Science Magazine thinks of it .
This was an issue from 2002 that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human .
It was basically a regenerative medicine issue .
Regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept that everybody can understand .
It &apos;s simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself to a clinically relevant timescale .
So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there .
We know that if we have a damaged hip , you can put an artificial hip in .
And this is the idea that Science Magazine used on their front cover .
This is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine .
This is not regenerative medicine .
Regenerative medicine is what Business Week put up when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago .
The idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms with devices and drugs and the like — and I &apos;ll come back to that theme a few times — instead of doing that , we will regenerate lost function of the body by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue .
So that at the end of the treatment , you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment .
Very few good ideas — if you agree that this is a good idea — very few good ideas are truly novel .
And this is just the same .
If you look back in history , Charles Lindbergh , who was better known for flying airplanes , was actually one of the first people along with Alexis Carrel , one of the Nobel Laureates from Rockefeller , to begin to think about , could you culture organs ?
And they published this book in 1937 , where they actually began to think about , what could you do in bio-reactors to grow whole organs ?
We &apos;ve come a long way since then .
I &apos;m going to share with you some of the exciting work that &apos;s going on .
But before doing that , what I &apos;d like to do is share my depression about the health care system and the need for this with you .
Many of the talks yesterday talked about improving the quality of life , and reducing poverty , and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe .
One of the challenges is that the richer we are , the longer we live .
And the longer we live , the more expensive it is to take care of our diseases as we get older .
This is simply the wealth of a country versus the percent of population over the age of 65 .
And you can basically see that the richer a country is , the older the people are within it .
Why is this important ?
And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now ?
If the average age of your population is 30 , then the average kind of disease that you have to treat is maybe a broken ankle every now and again , maybe a little bit of asthma .
If the average age in your country is 45 to 55 , now the average person is looking at diabetes , early-onset diabetes , heart failure , coronary artery disease — things that are inherently more difficult to treat , and much more expensive to treat .
Just have a look at the demographics in the U.S. here .
This is from &quot; &quot; The Untied States of America . &quot; &quot; In 1930 , there were 41 workers per retiree .
41 people who were basically outside of being really sick , paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease .
In 2010 , two workers per retiree in the U.S.
And this is matched in every industrialized , wealthy country in the world .
How can you actually afford to treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this ?
This is age versus cost of health care .
And you can see that right around age 45 , 40 to 45 , there &apos;s a sudden spike in the cost of health care .
It &apos;s actually quite interesting . If you do the right studies , you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care , plotted over your lifetime .
And about seven years before you &apos;re about to die , there &apos;s a spike .
And you can actually — ( Laughter ) — we won &apos;t get into that . ( Laughter )
There are very few things , very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases and experience what I would call healthy aging .
I &apos;d suggest there are four things , and none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system .
All those things do is change who pays .
They don &apos;t actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is .
One thing you can do is not treat . You can ration health care .
We won &apos;t talk about that anymore . It &apos;s too depressing .
You can prevent .
Obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention .
But perhaps most interesting , to me anyway , and most important , is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression , and then treating the disease to cure the disease instead of treating a symptom .
Think of it in terms of diabetes , for instance .
Today , with diabetes , what do we do ?
We diagnose the disease eventually , once it becomes symptomatic , and then we treat the symptom for 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 years .
And we do OK . Insulin &apos;s a pretty good therapy .
But eventually it stops working , and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease .
Why couldn &apos;t we just inject the pancreas with something to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease , perhaps even before it was symptomatic ?
And it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it , but if it worked , we would truly be able to do something different .
This video , I think , gets across the concept that I &apos;m talking about quite dramatically .
This is a newt re-growing its limb .
If a newt can do this kind of thing , why can &apos;t we ?
I &apos;ll actually show you some more important features about limb regeneration in a moment .
But what we &apos;re talking about in regenerative medicine is doing this in every organ system of the body , for tissues and for organs themselves .
So today &apos;s reality is that if we get sick , the message is we will treat your symptoms , and you need to adjust to a new way of life .
I would pose to you that tomorrow — and when tomorrow is we could debate , but it &apos;s within the foreseeable future — we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation .
There &apos;s a limb prosthetic up here , similar actually one on the soldier that &apos;s come back from Iraq .
There are 370 soldiers that have come back from Iraq that have lost limbs .
Imagine if instead of facing that , they could actually face the regeneration of that limb .
It &apos;s a wild concept .
I &apos;ll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept .
But it &apos;s applicable , again , to every organ system .
How can we do that ?
The way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body .
We need to learn to speak the body &apos;s language .
And to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus .
A mammalian fetus , if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy , will re-grow that limb .
So our DNA has the capacity to do these kinds of wound-healing mechanisms .
It &apos;s a natural process , but it is lost as we age .
In a child , before the age of about six months , if they lose their fingertip in an accident , they &apos;ll re-grow their fingertip .
By the time they &apos;re five , they won &apos;t be able to do that anymore .
So to engage in that conversation with the body , we need to speak the body &apos;s language .
And there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today .
I &apos;m going to give you an example of three of these tools through which to converse with the body .
The first is cellular therapies .
Clearly , we heal ourselves in a natural process , using cells to do most of the work .
Therefore , if we can find the right cells and implant them in the body , they may do the healing .
Secondly , we can use materials .
We heard yesterday about the importance of new materials .
If we can invent materials , design materials , or extract materials from a natural environment , then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself .
And finally , we may be able to use smart devices that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal .
I &apos;m going to show you an example of each of these , and I &apos;m going to start with materials .
Steve Badylak — who &apos;s at the University of Pittsburgh — about a decade ago had a remarkable idea .
And that idea was that the small intestine of a pig , if you threw away all the cells , and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active , may contain all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself .
And he asked a very important question .
He asked the question , if I take that material , which is a natural material that usually induces healing in the small intestine , and I place it somewhere else on a person &apos;s body , would it give a tissue-specific response , or would it make small intestine if I tried to make a new ear ?
I wouldn &apos;t be telling you this story if it weren &apos;t compelling .
The picture I &apos;m about to show you is a compelling picture .
( Laughter ) However , for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish — even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends — the lights are down . This is a good time to look at your feet , check your Blackberry , do anything other than look at the screen . ( Laughter )
What I &apos;m about to show you is a diabetic ulcer .
And although — it &apos;s good to laugh before we look at this .
This is the reality of diabetes .
I think a lot of times we hear about diabetics , diabetic ulcers , we just don &apos;t connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment , which is amputation , if you can &apos;t heal it .
So I &apos;m going to put the slide up now . It won &apos;t be up for long .
This is a diabetic ulcer . It &apos;s tragic .
The treatment for this is amputation .
This is an older lady . She has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes , and has decided to die with what &apos; s left of her body intact .
And this lady decided , after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer , that she would try this new therapy that Steve invented .
That &apos;s what the wound looked like 11 weeks later .
That material contained only natural signals .
And that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response that it didn &apos;t have before .
There &apos;s going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you — I &apos;ll let you know when you can look again .
This is a horse . The horse is not in pain .
If the horse was in pain , I wouldn &apos;t show you this slide .
The horse just has another nostril that &apos;s developed because of a riding accident .
Just a few weeks after treatment — in this case , taking that material , turning it into a gel , and packing that area , and then repeating the treatment a few times — and the horse heals up .
And if you took an ultrasound of that area , it would look great .
Here &apos;s a dolphin where the fin &apos;s been re-attached .
There are now 400,000 patients around the world who have used that material to heal their wounds .
Could you regenerate a limb ?
DARPA just gave Steve 15 million dollars to lead an eight-institution project to begin the process of asking that question .
And I &apos;ll show you the 15 million dollar picture .
This is a 78 year-old man who &apos;s lost the end of his fingertip .
Remember that I mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips .
After treatment that &apos;s what it looks like .
This is happening today .
This is clinically relevant today .
There are materials that do this . Here are the heart patches .
But could you go a little further ?
Could you , say , instead of using material , can I take some cells along with the material , and remove a damaged piece of tissue , put a bio-degradable material on there ?
You can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish .
This was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women &apos;s Hospital .
He can actually grow beating tissue in a dish .
He chills the dish , it changes its properties and he peels it right out of the dish .
It &apos;s the coolest stuff .
Now I &apos;m going to show you cell-based regeneration .
And what I &apos;m going to show you here is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient .
Again , if you &apos;re squeamish , you don &apos;t want to watch .
But this one &apos;s kind of cool .
So this is a bypass operation , just like what Al Gore had , with a difference .
In this case , at the end of the bypass operation , you &apos;re going to see the stem cells from the patient that were removed at the beginning of the procedure being injected directly into the heart of the patient .
And I &apos;m standing up here because at one point I &apos;m going to show you just how early this technology is .
Here go the stem cells , right into the beating heart of the patient .
And if you look really carefully , it &apos;s going to be right around this point you &apos;ll actually see a back-flush .
You see the cells coming back out .
We need all sorts of new technology , new devices , to get the cells to the right place at the right time .
Just a little bit of data , a tiny bit of data .
This was a randomized trial .
At this time this was an N of 20 . Now there &apos;s an N of about 100 .
Basically , if you take an extremely sick patient and you give them a bypass , they get a little bit better .
If you give them stem cells as well as their bypass , for these particular patients , they became asymptomatic .
These are now two years out .
The coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early , and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state .
This is the same procedure , but now done minimally invasively , with only three holes in the body where they &apos;re taking the heart and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure .
There go the cells .
We don &apos;t have time to go into all of those details , but basically , that works too .
You can take patients who are less sick , and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state through that kind of therapy .
Here &apos;s another example of stem-cell therapy that isn &apos;t quite clinical yet , but I think very soon will be .
This is the work of Kacey Marra from Pittsburgh , along with a number of colleagues around the world .
They &apos;ve decided that liposuction fluid , which — in the United States , we have a lot of liposuction fluid .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a great source of stem cells .
Stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid .
So you could go in , you could get your tummy-tuck .
Out comes the liposuction fluid , and in this case , the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons .
All done in the lab .
And I think fairly soon , you will see patients being treated with their own fat-derived , or adipose-derived , stem cells .
I talked before about the use of devices to dramatically change the way we treat disease .
Here &apos;s just one example before I close up .
This is equally tragic .
We have a very abiding and heartbreaking partnership with our colleagues at the Institute for Surgical Research in the US Army , who have to treat the now 11,000 kids that have come back from Iraq .
Many of those patients are very severely burned .
And if there &apos;s anything that &apos;s been learned about burn , it &apos;s that we don &apos;t know how to treat it .
Everything that is done to treat burn — basically we do a sodding approach .
We make something over here , and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound , and we try and get the two to take .
In this case here , a new , wearable bio-reactor has been designed — it should be tested clinically later this year at ISR — by Joerg Gerlach in Pittsburgh .
And that bio-reactor will lay down in the wound bed .
The gun that you see there sprays cells .
That &apos;s going to spray cells over that area .
The reactor will serve to fertilize the environment , deliver other things as well at the same time , and therefore we will seed that lawn , as opposed to try the sodding approach .
It &apos;s a completely different way of doing it .
So my 18 minutes is up .
So let me finish up with some good news , and maybe a little bit of bad news .
The good news is that this is happening today .
It &apos;s very powerful work .
Clearly the images kind of get that across .
It &apos;s incredibly difficult because it &apos;s highly inter-disciplinary .
Almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice is involved in trying to get this to happen .
A number of governments , and a number of regions , have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease .
The Japanese government were perhaps the first , when they decided to invest first 3 billion , later another 2 billion in this field .
It &apos;s no coincidence .
Japan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age .
They need this to work or their health system dies .
So they &apos;re putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this area .
The European Union , same thing .
China , the same thing .
China just launched a national tissue-engineering center .
The first year budget was 250 million US dollars .
In the United States we &apos;ve had a somewhat different approach .
( Laughter ) Oh , for Al Gore to come and be in the real world as president .
We &apos;ve had a different approach .
And the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along .
But there &apos;s been no strategic investment to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way .
And I &apos;m going to finish up with a quote , maybe a little cheap shot , at the director of the NIH , who &apos;s a very charming man .
Myself and Jay Vacanti from Harvard went to visit with him and a number of his directors of his institute just a few months ago , to try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece of that 27.5 billion dollars that he &apos;s going to get next year and focus it , in a strategic way , to make sure we can accelerate the pace at which these things get to patients .
And at the end of a very testy meeting , what the NIH director said was , &quot; Your vision is larger than our appetite . &quot;
I &apos;d like to close by saying that no one &apos;s going to change our vision , but together we can change his appetite .
Thank you .
If you are a blind child in India , you will very likely have to contend with at least two big pieces of bad news .
The first bad news is that the chances of getting treatment are extremely slim to none , and that &apos;s because most of the blindness alleviation programs in the country are focused on adults , and there are very , very few hospitals that are actually equipped to treat children .
In fact , if you were to be treated , you might well end up being treated by a person who has no medical credentials as this case from Rajasthan illustrates .
This is a three-year-old orphan girl who had cataracts .
So , her caretakers took her to the village medicine man , and instead of suggesting to the caretakers that the girl be taken to a hospital , the person decided to burn her abdomen with red-hot iron bars to drive out the demons .
The second piece of bad news will be delivered to you by neuroscientists , who will tell you that if you are older than four or five years of age , that even if you have your eye corrected , the chances of your brain learning how to see are very , very slim — again , slim or none .
So when I heard these two things , it troubled me deeply , both because of personal reasons and scientific reasons .
So let me first start with the personal reason .
It &apos;ll sound corny , but it &apos;s sincere .
That &apos;s my son , Darius .
As a new father , I have a qualitatively different sense of just how delicate babies are , what our obligations are towards them and how much love we can feel towards a child .
I would move heaven and earth in order to get treatment for Darius , and for me to be told that there might be other Dariuses who are not getting treatment , that &apos;s just viscerally wrong .
So that &apos;s the personal reason .
Scientific reason is that this notion from neuroscience of critical periods — that if the brain is older than four or five years of age , it loses its ability to learn — that doesn &apos;t sit well with me , because I don &apos;t think that idea has been tested adequately .
So , they did their work with kittens , with different kinds of deprivation regiments , and those studies , which date back to the &apos; 60s , are now being applied to human children .
So I felt that I needed to do two things .
One : provide care to children who are currently being deprived of treatment .
That &apos;s the humanitarian mission .
And the scientific mission would be to test the limits of visual plasticity .
And these two missions , as you can tell , thread together perfectly . One adds to the other ; in fact , one would be impossible without the other .
So , to implement these twin missions , a few years ago , I launched Project Prakash .
Prakash , as many of you know , is the Sanskrit word for light , and the idea is that in bringing light into the lives of children , we also have a chance of shedding light on some of the deepest mysteries of neuroscience .
And the logo — even though it looks extremely Irish , it &apos;s actually derived from the Indian symbol of Diya , an earthen lamp .
The Prakash , the overall effort has three components : outreach , to identify children in need of care ; medical treatment ; and in subsequent study .
And I want to show you a short video clip that illustrates the first two components of this work .
This is an outreach station conducted at a school for the blind .
( Text : Most of the children are profoundly and permanently blind ... ) Pawan Sinha : So , because this is a school for the blind , many children have permanent conditions .
That &apos;s a case of microphthalmos , which is malformed eyes , and that &apos;s a permanent condition ; it cannot be treated .
But , every so often , we come across children who show some residual vision , and that is a very good sign that the condition might actually be treatable .
So , after that screening , we bring the children to the hospital .
It has a very well-equipped pediatric ophthalmic center , which was made possible in part by a gift from the Ronald McDonald charity .
So , eating burgers actually helps .
( Text : Such examinations allow us to improve eye-health in many children , and ...
... help us find children who can participate in Project Prakash . ) PS : So , as I zoom in to the eyes of this child , you will see the cause of his blindness .
The whites that you see in the middle of his pupils are congenital cataracts , so opacities of the lens .
In our eyes , the lens is clear , but in this child , the lens has become opaque , and therefore he can &apos;t see the world .
So , the child is given treatment . You &apos;ll see shots of the eye .
Here &apos;s the eye with the opaque lens , the opaque lens extracted and an acrylic lens inserted .
And here &apos;s the same child three weeks post-operation , with the right eye open .
( Applause ) Thank you .
So , even from that little clip , you can begin to get the sense that recovery is possible , and we have now provided treatment to over 200 children , and the story repeats itself .
After treatment , the child gains significant functionality .
In fact , the story holds true even if you have a person who got sight after several years of deprivation .
We did a paper a few years ago about this woman that you see on the right , SRD , and she got her sight late in life , and her vision is remarkable at this age .
I should add a tragic postscript to this — she died two years ago in a bus accident .
So , hers is just a truly inspiring story — unknown , but inspiring story .
So when we started finding these results , as you might imagine , it created quite a bit of stir in the scientific and the popular press .
Here &apos;s an article in Nature that profiled this work , and another one in Time .
So , we were fairly convinced — we are convinced — that recovery is feasible , despite extended visual deprivation .
The next obvious question to ask : What is the process of recovery ?
So , the way we study that is , let &apos;s say we find a child who has light sensitivity .
The child is provided treatment , and I want to stress that the treatment is completely unconditional ; there is no quid pro quo .
We treat many more children then we actually work with .
Every child who needs treatment is treated .
After treatment , about every week , we run the child on a battery of simple visual tests in order to see how their visual skills are coming on line .
And we try to do this for as long as possible .
This arc of development gives us unprecedented and extremely valuable information about how the scaffolding of vision gets set up .
What might be the causal connections between the early developing skills and the later developing ones ?
And we &apos;ve used this general approach to study many different visual proficiencies , but I want to highlight one particular one , and that is image parsing into objects .
So , any image of the kind that you see on the left , be it a real image or a synthetic image , it &apos;s made up of little regions that you see in the middle column , regions of different colors , different luminances .
The brain has this complex task of putting together , integrating , subsets of these regions into something that &apos;s more meaningful , into what we would consider to be objects , as you see on the right .
And nobody knows how this integration happens , and that &apos;s the question we asked with Project Prakash .
So , here &apos;s what happens very soon after the onset of sight .
Here &apos;s a person who had gained sight just a couple of weeks ago , and you see Ethan Myers , a graduate student from MIT , running the experiment with him .
His visual-motor coordination is quite poor , but you get a general sense of what are the regions that he &apos;s trying to trace out .
If you show him real world images , if you show others like him real world images , they are unable to recognize most of the objects because the world to them is over-fragmented ; it &apos;s made up of a collage , a patchwork , of regions of different colors and luminances .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s indicated in the green outlines .
When you ask them , &quot; Even if you can &apos;t name the objects , just point to where the objects are , &quot; these are the regions that they point to .
So the world is this complex patchwork of regions .
Even the shadow on the ball becomes its own object .
Interestingly enough , you give them a few months , and this is what happens .
Doctor : How many are these ?
Patient : These are two things .
Doctor : What are their shapes ?
Patient : Their shapes ...
This one is a circle , and this is a square .
PS : A very dramatic transformation has come about .
And the question is : What underlies this transformation ?
It &apos;s a profound question , and what &apos;s even more amazing is how simple the answer is .
The answer lies in motion and that &apos;s what I want to show you in the next clip .
Doctor : What shape do you see here ?
Patient : I can &apos;t make it out .
Doctor : Now ?
Patient : Triangle .
Doctor : How many things are these ?
Now , how many things are these ?
Patient : Two .
Doctor : What are these things ?
Patient : A square and a circle .
PS : And we see this pattern over and over again .
The one thing the visual system needs in order to begin parsing the world is dynamic information .
So the inference we are deriving from this , and several such experiments , is that dynamic information processing , or motion processing , serves as the bedrock for building the rest of the complexity of visual processing ; it leads to visual integration and eventually to recognition .
This simple idea has far reaching implications .
And let me just quickly mention two , one , drawing from the domain of engineering , and one from the clinic .
So , from the perspective of engineering , we can ask : Goven that we know that motion is so important for the human visual system , can we use this as a recipe for constructing machine-based vision systems that can learn on their own , that don &apos;t need to be programmed by a human programmer ?
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
I &apos;m at MIT , at MIT you need to apply whatever basic knowledge you gain .
So we are creating Dylan , which is a computational system with an ambitious goal of taking in visual inputs of the same kind that a human child would receive , and autonomously discovering : What are the objects in this visual input ?
So , don &apos;t worry about the internals of Dylan .
Here , I &apos;m just going to talk about how we test Dylan .
The way we test Dylan is by giving it inputs , as I said , of the same kind that a baby , or a child in Project Prakash would get .
But for a long time we couldn &apos;t quite figure out : Wow can we get these kinds of video inputs ?
So , I thought , could we have Darius serve as our babycam carrier , and that way get the inputs that we feed into Dylan ?
So that &apos;s what we did .
( Laughter ) I had to have long conversations with my wife . ( Laughter )
In fact , Pam , if you &apos;re watching this , please forgive me .
So , we modified the optics of the camera in order to mimic the baby &apos;s visual acuity .
As some of you might know , babyies are born pretty much legally blind .
Their acuity — our acuity is 20 / 20 ; babies &apos; acuity is like 20 / 800 , so they are looking at the world in a very , very blurry fashion .
Here &apos;s what a baby-cam video looks like .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thankfully , there isn &apos;t any audio to go with this .
What &apos;s amazing is that working with such highly degraded input , the baby , very quickly , is able to discover meaning in such input .
But then two or three days afterward , babies begin to pay attention to their mother &apos;s or their father &apos;s face .
How does that happen ? We want Dylan to be able to do that , and using this mantra of motion , Dylan actually can do that .
So , given that kind of video input , with just about six or seven minutes worth of video , Dylan can begin to extract patterns that include faces .
So , it &apos;s an important demonstration of the power of motion .
The clinical implication , it comes from the domain of autism .
Visual integration has been associated with autism by several researchers .
When we saw that , we asked : Could the impairment in visual integration be the manifestation of something underneath , of dynamic information processing deficiencies in autism ?
Because , if that hypothesis were to be true , it would have massive repercussions in our understanding of what &apos;s causing the many different aspects of the autism phenotype .
What you &apos;re going to see are video clips of two children — one neurotypical , one with autism , playing Pong .
So , while the child is playing Pong , we are tracking where they &apos;re looking .
In red are the eye movement traces .
This is the neurotypical child , and what you see is that the child is able to make cues of the dynamic information to predict where the ball is going to go .
Even before the ball gets to a place , the child is already looking there .
Contrast this with a child with autism playing the same game .
Instead of anticipating , the child always follows where the ball has been .
The efficiency of the use of dynamic information seems to be significantly compromised in autism .
So we are pursuing this line of work and hopefully we &apos;ll have more results to report soon .
Looking ahead , if you think of this disk as representing all of the children we &apos;ve treated so far , this is the magnitude of the problem .
The red dots are the children we have not treated .
So , there are many , many more children who need to be treated , and in order to expand the scope of the project , we are planning on launching The Prakash Center for Children , which will have a dedicated pediatric hospital , a school for the children we are treating and also a cutting-edge research facility .
The Prakash Center will integrate health care , education and research in a way that truly creates the whole to be greater than the sum of the parts .
So , to summarize : Prakash , in its five years of existence , it &apos;s had an impact in multiple areas , ranging from basic neuroscience plasticity and learning in the brain , to clinically relevant hypotheses like in autism , the development of autonomous machine vision systems , education of the undergraduate and graduate students , and most importantly in the alleviation of childhood blindness .
And for my students and I , it &apos;s been just a phenomenal experience because we have gotten to do interesting research , while at the same time helping the many children that we have worked with .
( Applause )
I have all my life wondered what &quot; &quot; mind-boggling &quot; &quot; meant .
After two days here , I declare myself boggled , and enormously impressed , and feel that you are one of the great hopes — not just for American achievement in science and technology , but for the whole world .
I &apos;ve come , however , on a special mission on behalf of my constituency , which are the 10-to-the-18th-power — that &apos;s a million trillion — insects and other small creatures , and to make a plea for them .
If we were to wipe out insects alone , just that group alone , on this planet — which we are trying hard to do — the rest of life and humanity with it would mostly disappear from the land .
And within a few months .
Now , how did I come to this particular position of advocacy ?
As a little boy , and through my teenage years , I became increasingly fascinated by the diversity of life .
I had a butterfly period , a snake period , a bird period , a fish period , a cave period and finally and definitively , an ant period .
By my college years , I was a devoted myrmecologist , a specialist on the biology of ants , but my attention and research continued to make journeys across the great variety of life on Earth in general — including all that it means to us as a species , how little we understand it and how pressing a danger that our activities have created for it .
Out of that broader study has emerged a concern and an ambition , crystallized in the wish that I &apos;m about to make to you .
My choice is the culmination of a lifetime commitment that began with growing up on the Gulf Coast of Alabama , on the Florida peninsula .
As far back as I can remember , I was enchanted by the natural beauty of that region and the almost tropical exuberance of the plants and animals that grow there .
One day when I was only seven years old and fishing , I pulled a &quot; &quot; pinfish , &quot; &quot; they &apos;re called , with sharp dorsal spines , up too hard and fast , and I blinded myself in one eye .
I later discovered I was also hard of hearing , possibly congenitally , in the upper registers .
So in planning to be a professional naturalist — I never considered anything else in my entire life — I found that I was lousy at bird watching and couldn &apos;t track frog calls either .
So I turned to the teeming small creatures that can be held between the thumb and forefinger : the little things that compose the foundation of our ecosystems , the little things , as I like to say , who run the world .
In so doing , I reached a frontier of biology so strange , so rich , that it seemed as though it exists on another planet .
In fact , we live on a mostly unexplored planet .
The great majority of organisms on Earth remain unknown to science .
In the last 30 years , thanks to explorations in remote parts of the world and advances in technology , biologists have , for example , added a full one-third of the known frog and other amphibian species , to bring the current total to 5,400 , and more continue to pour in .
Two new kinds of whales have been discovered , along with two new antelopes , dozens of monkey species and a new kind of elephant — and even a distinct kind of gorilla .
At the extreme opposite end of the size scale , the class of marine bacteria , the Prochlorococci — that will be on the final exam — although discovered only in 1988 , are now recognized as likely the most abundant organisms on Earth , and moreover , responsible for a large part of the photosynthesis that occurs in the ocean .
These bacteria were not uncovered sooner because they are also among the smallest of all Earth &apos;s organisms — so minute that they cannot be seen with conventional optical microscopy .
Yet life in the sea may depend on these tiny creatures .
These examples are just the first glimpse of our ignorance of life on this planet .
Consider the fungi — including mushrooms , rusts , molds and many disease-causing organisms .
60,000 species are known to science , but more than 1.5 million have been estimated to exist .
Consider the nematode roundworm , the most abundant of all animals .
Four out of five animals on Earth are nematode worms — if all solid materials except nematode worms were to be eliminated , you could still see the ghostly outline of most of it in nematode worms .
About 16,000 species of nematode worms have been discovered and diagnosed by scientists ; there could be hundreds of thousands of them , even millions , still unknown .
This vast domain of hidden biodiversity is increased still further by the dark matter of the biological world of bacteria , which within just the last several years still were known from only about 6,000 species of bacteria worldwide .
But that number of bacteria species can be found in one gram of soil , just a little handful of soil , in the 10 billion bacteria that would be there .
It &apos;s been estimated that a single ton of soil — fertile soil — contains approximately four million species of bacteria , all unknown .
So the question is : what are they all doing ?
The fact is , we don &apos;t know .
We are living on a planet with a lot of activities , with reference to our living environment , done by faith and guess alone .
Our lives depend upon these creatures .
To take an example close to home : there are over 500 species of bacteria now known — friendly bacteria — living symbiotically in your mouth and throat probably necessary to your health for holding off pathogenic bacteria .
At this point I think we have a little impressionistic film that was made especially for this occasion .
And I &apos;d like to show it .
Assisted in this by Billie Holiday .
( Video ) And that may be just the beginning !
The viruses , those quasi-organisms among which are the prophages , the gene weavers that promote the continued evolution in the lives of the bacteria , are a virtually unknown frontier of modern biology , a world unto themselves .
What constitutes a viral species is still unresolved , although they &apos;re obviously of enormous importance to us .
But this much we can say : the variety of genes on the planet in viruses exceeds , or is likely to exceed , that in all of the rest of life combined .
Nowadays , in addressing microbial biodiversity , scientists are like explorers in a rowboat launched onto the Pacific Ocean .
But that is changing rapidly with the aid of new genomic technology .
Already it is possible to sequence the entire genetic code of a bacterium in under four hours .
Soon we will be in a position to go forth in the field with sequencers on our backs — to hunt bacteria in tiny crevices of the habitat &apos;s surface in the way you go watching for birds with binoculars .
What will we find as we map the living world , as , finally , we get this underway seriously ?
As we move past the relatively gigantic mammals , birds , frogs and plants to the more elusive insects and other small invertebrates and then beyond to the countless millions of organisms in the invisible living world enveloped and living within humanity ?
Already what were thought to be bacteria for generations have been found to compose , instead , two great domains of microorganisms : true bacteria and one-celled organisms the archaea , which are closer than other bacteria to the eukaryota , the group that we belong to .
Some serious biologists , and I count myself among them , have begun to wonder that among the enormous and still unknown diversity of microorganisms , one might — just might — find aliens among them .
True aliens , stocks that arrived from outer space .
They &apos;ve had billions of years to do it , but especially during the earliest period of biological evolution on this planet .
We do know that some bacterial species that have earthly origin are capable of almost unimaginable extremes of temperature and other harsh changes in environment , including hard radiation strong enough and maintained long enough to crack the Pyrex vessels around the growing population of bacteria .
There may be a temptation to treat the biosphere holistically and the species that compose it as a great flux of entities hardly worth distinguishing one from the other .
But each of these species , even the tiniest Prochlorococci , are masterpieces of evolution .
Each has persisted for thousands to millions of years .
Each is exquisitely adapted to the environment in which it lives , interlocked with other species to form ecosystems upon which our own lives depend in ways we have not begun even to imagine .
We will destroy these ecosystems and the species composing them at the peril of our own existence — and unfortunately we are destroying them with ingenuity and ceaseless energy .
My own epiphany as a conservationist came in 1953 , while a Harvard graduate student , searching for rare ants found in the mountain forests of Cuba , ants that shine in the sunlight — metallic green or metallic blue , according to species , and one species , I discovered , metallic gold .
I found my magical ants , but only after a tough climb into the mountains where the last of the native Cuban forests hung on , and were then — and still are — being cut back .
I realized then that these species and a large part of the other unique , marvelous animals and plants on that island — and this is true of practically every part of the world — which took millions of years to evolve , are in the process of disappearing forever .
And so it is everywhere one looks .
The human juggernaut is permanently eroding Earth &apos;s ancient biosphere by a combination of forces that can be summarized by the acronym &quot; &quot; HIPPO , &quot; &quot; the animal hippo .
H is for habitat destruction , including climate change forced by greenhouse gases .
I is for the invasive species like the fire ants , the zebra mussels , broom grasses and pathogenic bacteria and viruses that are flooding every country , and at an exponential rate — that &apos;s the I.
The P , the first one in &quot; &quot; HIPPO , &quot; &quot; is for pollution .
The second is for continued population , human population expansion .
And the final letter is O , for over-harvesting — driving species into extinction by excessive hunting and fishing .
The HIPPO juggernaut we have created , if unabated , is destined — according to the best estimates of ongoing biodiversity research — to reduce half of Earth &apos;s still surviving animal and plant species to extinction or critical endangerment by the end of the century .
Human-forced climate change alone — again , if unabated — could eliminate a quarter of surviving species during the next five decades .
What will we and all future generations lose if much of the living environment is thus degraded ?
Huge potential sources of scientific information yet to be gathered , much of our environmental stability and new kinds of pharmaceuticals and new products of unimaginable strength and value — all thrown away .
The loss will inflict a heavy price in wealth , security and yes , spirituality for all time to come , because previous cataclysms of this kind — the last one , that ended the age of dinosaurs — took , normally , five to 10 million years to repair .
Sadly , our knowledge of biodiversity is so incomplete that we are at risk of losing a great deal of it before it is even discovered .
For example , even in the United States , the 200,000 species known currently actually has been found to be only partial in coverage ; it is mostly unknown to us in basic biology .
Only about 15 percent of the known species have been studied well enough to evaluate their status .
Of the 15 percent evaluated , 20 percent are classified as &quot; &quot; in peril , &quot; &quot; that is , in danger of extinction .
That &apos;s in the United States .
We are , in short , flying blind into our environmental future .
We urgently need to change this .
We need to have the biosphere properly explored so that we can understand and competently manage it .
We need to settle down before we wreck the planet .
And we need that knowledge .
This should be a big science project equivalent to the Human Genome Project .
It should be thought of as a biological moonshot with a timetable .
So this brings me to my wish for TEDsters , and to anyone else around the world who hears this talk .
I wish we will work together to help create the key tools that we need to inspire preservation of Earth &apos;s biodiversity .
And let us call it the &quot; &quot; Encyclopedia of Life . &quot; &quot; What is the &quot; &quot; Encyclopedia of Life ? &quot; &quot; A concept that has already taken hold and is beginning to spread and be looked at seriously ?
It is an encyclopedia that lives on the Internet and is contributed to by thousands of scientists around the world .
Amateurs can do it also .
It has an indefinitely expandable page for each species .
It makes all key information about life on Earth accessible to anyone , on demand , anywhere in the world .
I &apos;ve written about this idea before , and I know there are people in this room who have expended significant effort on it in the past .
But what excites me is that since I first put forward this particular idea in that form , science has advanced .
Technology has moved forward .
Today , the practicalities of making such an encyclopedia , regardless of the magnitude of the information put into it , are within reach .
Indeed , in the past year , a group of influential scientific institutions have begun mobilizing to realize this dream .
I wish you would help them .
Working together , we can make this real .
The encyclopedia will quickly pay for itself in practical applications .
It will address transcendent qualities in the human consciousness , and sense of human need .
It will transform the science of biology in ways of obvious benefit to humanity .
And most of all , it can inspire a new generation of biologists to continue the quest that started , for me personally , 60 years ago : to search for life , to understand it and finally , above all , to preserve it .
That is my wish . Thank you .
I &apos;d like to begin by talking about some of the ideas that motivated me to become a documentary photographer .
I was a student in the &apos; 60s , a time of social upheaval and questioning , and on a personal level , an awakening sense of idealism .
The war in Vietnam was raging ; the Civil Rights Movement was under way ; and pictures had a powerful influence on me .
Our political and military leaders were telling us one thing , and photographers were telling us another .
I believed the photographers , and so did millions of other Americans .
Their images fueled resistance to the war and to racism .
They not only recorded history ; they helped change the course of history .
Their pictures became part of our collective consciousness and , as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience , change became not only possible , but inevitable .
I saw that the free flow of information represented by journalism , specifically visual journalism , can bring into focus both the benefits and the cost of political policies .
It can give credit to sound decision-making , adding momentum to success .
In the face of poor political judgment or political inaction , it becomes a kind of intervention , assessing the damage and asking us to reassess our behavior .
It puts a human face on issues which from afar can appear abstract or ideological or monumental in their global impact .
What happens at ground level , far from the halls of power , happens to ordinary citizens one by one .
And I understood that documentary photography has the ability to interpret events from their point of view .
It gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice .
And as a reaction , it stimulates public opinion and gives impetus to public debate , thereby preventing the interested parties from totally controlling the agenda , much as they would like to .
Coming of age in those days made real the concept that the free flow of information is absolutely vital for a free and dynamic society to function properly .
The press is certainly a business , and in order to survive it must be a successful business , but the right balance must be found between marketing considerations and journalistic responsibility .
Society &apos;s problems can &apos;t be solved until they &apos;re identified .
On a higher plane , the press is a service industry , and the service it provides is awareness .
Every story does not have to sell something .
There &apos;s also a time to give .
That was a tradition I wanted to follow .
Seeing the war created such incredibly high stakes for everyone involved and that visual journalism could actually become a factor in conflict resolution — I wanted to be a photographer in order to be a war photographer .
But I was driven by an inherent sense that a picture that revealed the true face of war would almost by definition be an anti-war photograph .
I &apos;d like to take you on a visual journey through some of the events and issues I &apos;ve been involved in over the past 25 years .
In 1981 , I went to Northern Ireland .
10 IRA prisoners were in the process of starving themselves to death in protest against conditions in jail .
The reaction on the streets was violent confrontation .
I saw that the front lines of contemporary wars are not on isolated battlefields , but right where people live .
During the early &apos; 80s , I spent a lot of time in Central America , which was engulfed by civil wars that straddled the ideological divide of the Cold War .
In Guatemala , the central government — controlled by a oligarchy of European decent — was waging a scorched Earth campaign against an indigenous rebellion , and I saw an image that reflected the history of Latin America : conquest through a combination of the Bible and the sword .
An anti-Sandinista guerrilla was mortally wounded as Commander Zero attacked a town in Southern Nicaragua .
A destroyed tank belonging to Somoza &apos;s national guard was left as a monument in a park in Managua , and was transformed by the energy and spirit of a child .
At the same time , a civil war was taking place in El Salvador , and again , the civilian population was caught up in the conflict .
I &apos;ve been covering the Palestinian-Israeli conflict since 1981 .
This is a moment from the beginning of the second intifada , in 2000 , when it was still stones and Molotovs against an army .
In 2001 , the uprising escalated into an armed conflict , and one of the major incidents was the destruction of the Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank town of Jenin .
Without the political will to find common ground , the continual friction of tactic and counter-tactic only creates suspicion and hatred and vengeance , and perpetuates the cycle of violence .
In the &apos; 90s , after the breakup of the Soviet Union , Yugoslavia fractured along ethnic fault lines , and civil war broke out between Bosnia , Croatia and Serbia .
This is a scene of house-to-house fighting in Mostar , neighbor against neighbor .
A bedroom , the place where people share intimacy , where life itself is conceived , became a battlefield .
Dead Serbian soldiers were collected after a battle and used as barter for the return of prisoners or Bosnian soldiers killed in action .
This was once a park .
The Bosnian soldier who guided me told me that all of his friends were there now .
At the same time in South Africa , after Nelson Mandela had been released from prison , the black population commenced the final phase of liberation from apartheid .
One of the things I had to learn as a journalist was what to do with my anger .
I had to use it , channel its energy , turn it into something that would clarify my vision , instead of clouding it .
In Transkei , I witnessed a rite of passage into manhood , of the Xhosa tribe .
Teenage boys lived in isolation , their bodies covered with white clay .
After several weeks , they washed off the white and took on the full responsibilities of men .
Children in Soweto playing on a trampoline .
Elsewhere in Africa there was famine .
In Somalia , the central government collapsed and clan warfare broke out .
Farmers were driven off their land , and crops and livestock were destroyed or stolen .
Starvation was being used as a weapon of mass destruction — primitive but extremely effective .
Hundreds of thousands of people were exterminated , slowly and painfully .
The international community responded with massive humanitarian relief , and hundreds of thousands of more lives were saved .
American troops were sent to protect the relief shipments , but they were eventually drawn into the conflict , and after the tragic battle in Mogadishu , they were withdrawn .
In southern Sudan , another civil war saw similar use of starvation as a means of genocide .
Again , international NGOs , united under the umbrella of the U.N. , staged a massive relief operation and thousands of lives were saved .
I &apos;m a witness , and I want my testimony to be honest and uncensored .
I also want it to be powerful and eloquent , and to do as much justice as possible to the experience of the people I &apos;m photographing .
This man was in an NGO feeding center , being helped as much as he could be helped .
He literally had nothing . He was a virtual skeleton , yet he could still summon the courage and the will to move .
He had not given up , and if he didn &apos;t give up , how could anyone in the outside world ever dream of losing hope ?
In 1994 , after three months of covering the South African election , I saw the inauguration of Nelson Mandela , and it was the most uplifting thing I &apos;ve ever seen .
It exemplified the best that humanity has to offer .
The next day I left for Rwanda , and it was like taking the express elevator to hell .
This man had just been liberated from a Hutu death camp .
He allowed me to photograph him for quite a long time , and he even turned his face toward the light , as if he wanted me to see him better .
I think he knew what the scars on his face would say to the rest of the world .
This time , maybe confused or discouraged by the military disaster in Somalia , the international community remained silent , and somewhere around 800,000 people were slaughtered by their own countrymen — sometimes their own neighbors — using farm implements as weapons .
They were received in refugee camps set up by NGOs in Albania and Macedonia .
This is a Chechen rebel on the front line against the Russian army .
Ceausescu had imposed a quota on the number of children to be produced by each family , thereby making women &apos;s bodies an instrument of state economic policy .
Children who couldn &apos;t be supported by their families were raised in government orphanages .
Children with birth defects were labeled incurables , and confined for life to inhuman conditions .
As reports began to surface , again international aid went in .
Going deeper into the legacy of the Eastern European regimes , I worked for several months on a story about the effects of industrial pollution , where there had been no regard for the environment or the health of either workers or the general population .
An aluminum factory in Czechoslovakia was filled with carcinogenic smoke and dust , and four out of five workers came down with cancer .
When the story was published , unsolicited donations poured in .
A trust fund was established , and the family now lives in a house in the countryside and all their basic necessities are taken care of .
It was a story that wasn &apos;t trying to sell anything .
Journalism had provided a channel for people &apos;s natural sense of generosity , and the readers responded .
I met a band of homeless children who &apos;d come to Jakarta from the countryside , and ended up living in a train station .
By the age of 12 or 14 , they &apos;d become beggars and drug addicts .
The rural poor had become the urban poor , and in the process , they &apos;d become invisible .
I thought it was important to emphasize that people were being helped , whether by international NGOs or by local grassroots organizations .
A hospital in Zambia .
I began documenting the close connection between HIV / AIDS and tuberculosis .
This is an MSF hospital in Cambodia .
I went to Congo with MSF , and contributed to a book and an exhibition that focused attention on a forgotten war in which millions of people have died , and exposure to disease without treatment is used as a weapon .
A malnourished child being measured as part of the supplemental feeding program .
In the fall of 2004 I went to Darfur .
This time I was on assignment for a magazine , but again worked closely with MSF .
The international community still hasn &apos;t found a way to create the pressure necessary to stop this genocide .
This experience raised a lot of questions , among them questions about race and equality and for whom in our country opportunities and options are available .
In the yard of a chain gang in Alabama .
A few minutes later when I looked again and saw the second tower burning , I knew we were at war .
In the midst of the wreckage at Ground Zero , I had a realization .
The central commercial district of Kabul , Afghanistan at the end of the civil war , shortly before the city fell to the Taliban .
A boy who lost a leg to a leftover mine .
I understood that in its suffering , the Islamic world had been crying out . Why weren &apos;t we listening ?
A marketplace was hit by a mortar shell that killed several members of a single family .
A day after American forces entered Baghdad , a company of Marines began rounding up bank robbers and were cheered on by the crowds — a hopeful moment that was short lived .
A group of men march through the streets cutting themselves with knives .
It was obvious that the Shi &apos;ites were a force to be reckoned with , and we would do well to understand them and learn how to deal with them .
Sometimes they put their lives on the line , because they believe your opinions and your influence matter .
They aim their pictures at your best instincts , generosity , a sense of right and wrong , the ability and the willingness to identify with others , the refusal to accept the unacceptable .
My TED wish : there &apos;s a vital story that needs to be told , and I wish for TED to help me gain access to it and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways to use news photography in the digital era .
Thank you very much .

The key question is , &quot; &quot; When are we going to get fusion ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s really been a long time since we &apos;ve known about fusion .
We &apos;ve known about fusion since 1920 , when Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington and the British Association for the Advancement of Science conjectured that that &apos;s why the sun shines .
I &apos;ve always been very worried about resource .
I don &apos;t know about you , but when my mother gave me food , I always sorted the ones I disliked from the ones I liked .
And I ate the disliked ones first , because the ones you like , you want to save .
And as a child you &apos;re always worried about resource .
And once it was sort of explained to me how fast we were using up the world &apos;s resources , I got very upset , about as upset as I did when I realized that the Earth will only last about five billion years before it &apos;s swallowed by the sun .
Big events in my life , a strange child .
( Laughter ) Energy , at the moment , is dominated by resource .
The countries that make a lot of money out of energy have something underneath them .
Coal-powered industrial revolution in this country — oil , gas , sorry .
( Laughter ) Gas , I &apos;m probably the only person who really enjoys it when Mister Putin turns off the gas tap , because my budget goes up .
We &apos;re really dominated now by those things that we &apos;re using up faster and faster and faster .
And as we try to lift billions of people out of poverty in the Third World , in the developing world , we &apos;re using energy faster and faster .
And those resources are going away .
And the way we &apos;ll make energy in the future is not from resource , it &apos;s really from knowledge .
If you look 50 years into the future , the way we probably will be making energy is probably one of these three , with some wind , with some other things , but these are going to be the base load energy drivers .
Solar can do it , and we certainly have to develop solar .
But we have a lot of knowledge to gain before we can make solar the base load energy supply for the world .
Fission .
Our government is going to put in six new nuclear power stations .
They &apos;re going to put in six new nuclear power stations , and probably more after that .
China is building nuclear power stations . Everybody is .
Because they know that that is one sure way to do carbon-free energy .
But if you wanted to know what the perfect energy source is , the perfect energy source is one that doesn &apos;t take up much space , has a virtually inexhaustible supply , is safe , doesn &apos;t put any carbon into the atmosphere , doesn &apos;t leave any long-lived radioactive waste : it &apos;s fusion .
But there is a catch . Of course there is always a catch in these cases .
Fusion is very hard to do .
We &apos;ve been trying for 50 years .
Okay . What is fusion ? Here comes the nuclear physics .
And sorry about that , but this is what turns me on .
( Laughter ) I was a strange child .
Nuclear energy comes for a simple reason .
The most stable nucleus is iron , right in the middle of the periodic table .
It &apos;s a medium-sized nucleus .
And you want to go towards iron if you want to get energy .
So , uranium , which is very big , wants to split .
But small atoms want to join together , small nuclei want to join together to make bigger ones to go towards iron .
And you can get energy out this way .
And indeed that &apos;s exactly what stars do .
In the middle of stars , you &apos;re joining hydrogen together to make helium and then helium together to make carbon , to make oxygen , all the things that you &apos;re made of are made in the middle of stars .
But it &apos;s a hard process to do because , as you know , the middle of a star is quite hot , almost by definition .
And there is one reaction that &apos;s probably the easiest fusion reaction to do .
It &apos;s between two isotopes of hydrogen , two kinds of hydrogen : deuterium , which is heavy hydrogen , which you can get from seawater , and tritium which is super-heavy hydrogen .
These two nuclei , when they &apos;re far apart , are charged .
And you push them together and they repel .
But when you get them close enough , something called the strong force starts to act and pulls them together .
So , most of the time they repel .
You get them closer and closer and closer and then at some point the strong force grips them together .
For a moment they become helium 5 , because they &apos;ve got five particles inside them .
So , that &apos;s that process there . Deuterium and tritium goes together makes helium 5 .
Helium splits out , and a neutron comes out and lots of energy comes out .
If you can get something to about 150 million degrees , things will be rattling around so fast that every time they collide in just the right configuration , this will happen , and it will release energy .
And that energy is what powers fusion .
And it &apos;s this reaction that we want to do .
There is one trickiness about this reaction .
Well , there is a trickiness that you have to make it 150 million degrees , but there is a trickiness about the reaction yet .
It &apos;s pretty hot .
The trickiness about the reaction is that tritium doesn &apos;t exist in nature .
You have to make it from something else .
And you make if from lithium . That reaction at the bottom , that &apos;s lithium 6 , plus a neutron , will give you more helium , plus tritium .
And that &apos;s the way you make your tritium .
But fortunately , if you can do this fusion reaction , you &apos;ve got a neutron , so you can make that happen .
Now , why the hell would we bother to do this ?
This is basically why we would bother to do it .
If you just plot how much fuel we &apos;ve got left , in units of present world consumption .
And as you go across there you see a few tens of years of oil — the blue line , by the way , is the lowest estimate of existing resources .
And the yellow line is the most optimistic estimate .
And as you go across there you will see that we &apos;ve got a few tens of years , and perhaps 100 years of fossil fuels left .
And god knows we don &apos;t really want to burn all of it , because it will make an awful lot of carbon in the air .
And then we get to uranium .
And with current reactor technology we really don &apos;t have very much uranium .
And we will have to extract uranium from sea water , which is the yellow line , to make conventional nuclear power stations actually do very much for us .
This is a bit shocking , because in fact our government is relying on that for us to meet Kyoto , and do all those kind of things .
To go any further you would have to have breeder technology .
And breeder technology is fast breeders . And that &apos;s pretty dangerous .
The big thing , on the right , is the lithium we have in the world .
And lithium is in sea water . That &apos;s the yellow line .
And we have 30 million years worth of fusion fuel in sea water .
Everybody can get it . That &apos;s why we want to do fusion .
Is it cost-competitive ?
We make estimates of what we think it would cost to actually make a fusion power plant .
And we get within about the same price as current electricity .
So , how would we make it ?
We have to hold something at 150 million degrees .
And , in fact , we &apos;ve done this .
We hold it with a magnetic field .
And inside it , right in the middle of this toroidal shape , doughnut shape , right in the middle is 150 million degrees .
It boils away in the middle at 150 million degrees .
And in fact we can make fusion happen .
And just down the road , this is JET .
It &apos;s the only machine in the world that &apos;s actually done fusion .
When people say fusion is 30 years away , and always will be , I say , &quot; &quot; Yeah , but we &apos;ve actually done it . &quot; &quot; Right ?
We can do fusion . In the center of this device we made 16 megawatts of fusion power in 1997 .
And in 2013 we &apos;re going to fire it up again and break all those records .
But that &apos;s not really fusion power . That &apos;s just making some fusion happen .
We &apos;ve got to take that , we &apos;ve got to make that into a fusion reactor .
Because we want 30 million years worth of fusion power for the Earth .
This is the device we &apos;re building now .
It gets very expensive to do this research .
It turns out you can &apos;t do fusion on a table top despite all that cold fusion nonsense . Right ?
You can &apos;t . You have to do it in a very big device .
More than half the world &apos;s population is involved in building this device in southern France , which is a nice place to put an experiment .
Seven nations are involved in building this .
It &apos;s going to cost us 10 billion . And we &apos;ll produce half a gigawatt of fusion power .
But that &apos;s not electricity yet .
We have to get to this .
We have to get to a power plant .
We have to start putting electricity on the grid in this very complex technology .
And I &apos;d really like it to happen a lot faster than it is .
But at the moment , all we can imagine is sometime in the 2030s .
I wish this were different . We really need it now .
We &apos;re going to have a problem with power in the next five years in this country .
So 2030 looks like an infinity away .
But we can &apos;t abandon it now ; we have to push forward , get fusion to happen .
I wish we had more money , I wish we had more resources .
But this is what we &apos;re aiming at , sometime in the 2030s — real electric power from fusion . Thank you very much .

I know what you &apos;re thinking .
You think I &apos;ve lost my way , and somebody &apos;s going to come on the stage in a minute and guide me gently back to my seat .
( Applause ) I get that all the time in Dubai .
&quot; Here on holiday are you , dear ? &quot;
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Come to visit the children ?
How long are you staying ? &quot; &quot; Well actually , I hope for a while longer yet .
I have been living and teaching in the Gulf for over 30 years .
( Applause ) And in that time , I have seen a lot of changes .
Now that statistic is quite shocking .
And I want to talk to you today about language loss and the globalization of English .
I want to tell you about my friend who was teaching English to adults in Abu Dhabi .
And one fine day , she decided to take them into the garden to teach them some nature vocabulary .
But it was she who ended up learning all the Arabic words for the local plants , as well as their uses — medicinal uses , cosmetics , cooking , herbal .
How did those students get all that knowledge ?
Of course , from their grandparents and even their great-grandparents .
It &apos;s not necessary to tell you how important it is to be able to communicate across generations .
But sadly , today , languages are dying at an unprecedented rate .
A language dies every 14 days .
Now , at the same time , English is the undisputed global language .
Could there be a connection ?
Well I don &apos;t know .
But I do know that I &apos;ve seen a lot of changes .
When I first came out to the Gulf , I came to Kuwait in the days when it was still a hardship post .
Actually , not that long ago .
That is a little bit too early .
But nevertheless , I was recruited by the British Council , along with about 25 other teachers .
And we were the first non-Muslims to teach in the state schools there in Kuwait .
We were brought to teach English because the government wanted to modernize the country and to empower the citizens through education .
And of course , the U.K. benefited from some of that lovely oil wealth .
Okay .
Now this is the major change that I &apos;ve seen — how teaching English has morphed from being a mutually beneficial practice to becoming a massive international business that it is today .
No longer just a foreign language on the school curriculum , and no longer the sole domain of mother England , it has become a bandwagon for every English-speaking nation on earth .
And why not ?
After all , the best education — according to the latest World University Rankings — is to be found in the universities of the U.K. and the U.S.
So everybody wants to have an English education , naturally .
But if you &apos;re not a native speaker , you have to pass a test .
Now can it be right to reject a student on linguistic ability alone ?
Perhaps you have a computer scientist who &apos;s a genius .
Would he need the same language as a lawyer , for example ?
Well , I don &apos;t think so .
We English teachers reject them all the time .
We put a stop sign , and we stop them in their tracks .
They can &apos;t pursue their dream any longer , &apos; til they get English .
Now let me put it this way : if I met a monolingual Dutch speaker who had the cure for cancer , would I stop him from entering my British University ?
I don &apos;t think so .
But indeed , that is exactly what we do .
We English teachers are the gatekeepers .
And you have to satisfy us first that your English is good enough .
Now it can be dangerous to give too much power to a narrow segment of society .
Maybe the barrier would be too universal .
Okay .
&quot; &quot; But , &quot; &quot; I hear you say , &quot; &quot; what about the research ?
It &apos;s all in English . &quot; &quot; So the books are in English , the journals are done in English , but that is a self-fulfilling prophecy .
It feeds the English requirement .
And so it goes on .
I ask you , what happened to translation ?
If you think about the Islamic Golden Age , there was lots of translation then .
They translated from Latin and Greek into Arabic , into Persian , and then it was translated on into the Germanic languages of Europe and the Romance languages .
And so light shone upon the Dark Ages of Europe .
Now don &apos;t get me wrong ; I am not against teaching English , all you English teachers out there .
I love it that we have a global language .
We need one today more than ever .
But I am against using it as a barrier .
Do we really want to end up with 600 languages and the main one being English , or Chinese ?
We need more than that . Where do we draw the line ?
This system equates intelligence with a knowledge of English , which is quite arbitrary .
( Applause ) And I want to remind you that the giants upon whose shoulders today &apos;s intelligentsia stand did not have to have English , they didn &apos;t have to pass an English test .
Case in point , Einstein .
He , by the way , was considered remedial at school because he was , in fact , dyslexic .
But fortunately for the world , he did not have to pass an English test .
Because they didn &apos;t start until 1964 with TOEFL , the American test of English .
Now it &apos;s exploded .
There are lots and lots of tests of English .
And millions and millions of students take these tests every year .
Now you might think , you and me , &quot; Those fees aren &apos;t bad , they &apos;re okay , &quot; but they are prohibitive to so many millions of poor people .
So immediately , we &apos;re rejecting them .
( Applause ) It brings to mind a headline I saw recently : &quot; Education : The Great Divide . &quot;
Now I get it , I understand why people would want to focus on English .
They want to give their children the best chance in life .
And to do that , they need a Western education .
Because , of course , the best jobs go to people out of the Western Universities , that I put on earlier .
It &apos;s a circular thing .
Okay .
Let me tell you a story about two scientists , two English scientists .
They were doing an experiment to do with genetics and the forelimbs and the hind limbs of animals .
But they couldn &apos;t get the results they wanted .
They really didn &apos;t know what to do , until along came a German scientist who realized that they were using two words for forelimb and hind limb , whereas genetics does not differentiate and neither does German .
So bingo , problem solved .
If you can &apos;t think a thought , you are stuck .
But if another language can think that thought , then , by cooperating , we can achieve and learn so much more .
My daughter came to England from Kuwait .
She had studied science and mathematics in Arabic .
It &apos;s an Arabic-medium school .
She had to translate it into English at her grammar school .
And she was the best in the class at those subjects .
Which tells us that when students come to us from abroad , we may not be giving them enough credit for what they know , and they know it in their own language .
When a language dies , we don &apos;t know what we lose with that language .
This is — I don &apos;t know if you saw it on CNN recently — they gave the Heroes Award to a young Kenyan shepherd boy who couldn &apos;t study at night in his village , like all the village children , because the kerosene lamp , it had smoke and it damaged his eyes .
And anyway , there was never enough kerosene , because what does a dollar a day buy for you ?
So he invented a cost-free solar lamp .
And now the children in his village get the same grades at school as the children who have electricity at home .
( Applause ) When he received his award , he said these lovely words : &quot; &quot; The children can lead Africa from what it is today , a dark continent , to a light continent . &quot; &quot; A simple idea , but it could have such far-reaching consequences .
People who have no light , whether it &apos;s physical or metaphorical , cannot pass our exams , and we can never know what they know .
Let us not keep them and ourselves in the dark .
Let us celebrate diversity .
Mind your language .
Use it to spread great ideas .
( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
Why do so many people reach success and then fail ?
One of the big reasons is , we think success is a one-way street .
So we do everything that leads up to success , but then we get there . We figure we &apos;ve made it , we sit back in our comfort zone , and we actually stop doing everything that made us successful .
And it doesn &apos;t take long to go downhill .
And I can tell you this happens , because it happened to me .
Reaching success , I worked hard , I pushed myself .
But then I stopped , because I figured , &quot; &quot; Oh , you know , I made it .
I can just sit back and relax . &quot; &quot; Reaching success , I always tried to improve and do good work .
But then I stopped because I figured , &quot; &quot; Hey , I &apos;m good enough .
I don &apos;t need to improve any more . &quot; &quot; Reaching success , I was pretty good at coming up with good ideas .
Because I did all these simple things that led to ideas .
But then I stopped , because I figured I was this hot-shot guy and I shouldn &apos;t have to work at ideas , they should just come like magic .
And the only thing that came was creative block .
I couldn &apos;t come up with any ideas .
Reaching success , I always focused on clients and projects , and ignored the money . Then all this money started pouring in .
And I got distracted by it .
And suddenly I was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent , when I should have been talking to my clients .
And reaching success , I always did what I loved .
But then I got into stuff that I didn &apos;t love , like management . I am the world &apos;s worst manager , but I figured I should be doing it , because I was , after all , the president of the company .
Well , soon a black cloud formed over my head and here I was , outwardly very successful , but inwardly very depressed .
But I &apos;m a guy ; I knew how to fix it .
I bought a fast car .
( Laughter ) It didn &apos;t help .
I was faster but just as depressed .
So I went to my doctor . I said , &quot; &quot; Doc , I can buy anything I want . But I &apos;m not happy . I &apos;m depressed .
It &apos;s true what they say , and I didn &apos;t believe it until it happened to me .
But money can &apos;t buy happiness . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No . But it can buy Prozac . &quot; &quot; And he put me on anti-depressants .
And yeah , the black cloud faded a little bit , but so did all the work , because I was just floating along . I couldn &apos;t care less if clients ever called .
( Laughter ) And clients didn &apos;t call . ( Laughter )
Because they could see I was no longer serving them , I was only serving myself .
So they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better .
Well , it didn &apos;t take long for business to drop like a rock .
My partner and I , Thom , we had to let all our employees go .
It was down to just the two of us , and we were about to go under .
And that was great .
Because with no employees , there was nobody for me to manage .
So I went back to doing the projects I loved .
I had fun again , I worked harder and , to cut a long story short , did all the things that took me back up to success .
But it wasn &apos;t a quick trip .
It took seven years .
But in the end , business grew bigger than ever .
And when I went back to following these eight principles , the black cloud over my head disappeared altogether .
And I woke up one day and I said , &quot; I don &apos;t need Prozac anymore . &quot;
And I threw it away and haven &apos;t needed it since .
I learned that success isn &apos;t a one-way street .
It doesn &apos;t look like this ; it really looks more like this .
It &apos;s a continuous journey .
And if we want to avoid &quot; &quot; success-to-failure-syndrome , &quot; &quot; we just keep following these eight principles , because that is not only how we achieve success , it &apos;s how we sustain it .
So here is to your continued success .
Thank you very much .

Can we , as adults , grow new nerve cells ?
There &apos;s still some confusion about that question , as this is a fairly new field of research .
For example , I was talking to one of my colleagues , Robert , who is an oncologist , and he was telling me , &quot; &quot; Sandrine , this is puzzling .
Some of my patients that have been told they are cured of their cancer still develop symptoms of depression . &quot; &quot; And I responded to him , &quot; &quot; Well , from my point of view that makes sense .
The drug you give to your patients that stops the cancer cells multiplying also stops the newborn neurons being generated in their brain . &quot; &quot; And then Robert looked at me like I was crazy and said , &quot; &quot; But Sandrine , these are adult patients — adults do not grow new nerve cells . &quot; &quot; And much to his surprise , I said , &quot; &quot; Well actually , we do . &quot; &quot; And this is a phenomenon that we call neurogenesis .
So Robert , you know , being the good doctor that he is , wanted to come to my lab to understand the topic a little bit better .
And I took him for a tour of one of the most exciting parts of the brain when it comes to neurogenesis — and this is the hippocampus .
So this is this gray structure in the center of the brain .
And what we &apos;ve known already for very long , is that this is important for learning , memory , mood and emotion .
However , what we have learned more recently is that this is one of the unique structures of the adult brain where new neurons can be generated .
And if we slice through the hippocampus and zoom in , what you actually see here in blue is a newborn neuron in an adult mouse brain .
So when it comes to the human brain — my colleague Jonas Frisén from the Karolinska Institutet , has estimated that we produce 700 new neurons per day in the hippocampus .
But by the time we turn 50 , we will have all exchanged the neurons we were born with in that structure with adult-born neurons .
So why are these new neurons important and what are their functions ?
First , we know that they &apos;re important for learning and memory .
And this is especially new and true for spatial recognition — so like , how you navigate your way in the city .
And they will have been helpful to add time to our memory and they will help differentiate very similar memories , like : how do you find your bike that you park at the station every day in the same area , but in a slightly different position ?
And more interesting to my colleague Robert is the research we have been doing on neurogenesis and depression .
And if we give antidepressants , then we increase the production of these newborn neurons , and we decrease the symptoms of depression , establishing a clear link between neurogenesis and depression .
But moreover , if you just block neurogenesis , then you block the efficacy of the antidepressant .
So by then , Robert had understood that very likely his patients were suffering from depression even after being cured of their cancer , because the cancer drug had stopped newborn neurons from being generated .
And it will take time to generate new neurons that reach normal functions .
So , collectively , now we think we have enough evidence to say that neurogenesis is a target of choice if we want to improve memory formation or mood , or even prevent the decline associated with aging , or associated with stress .
So the next question is : can we control neurogenesis ?
The answer is yes .
And we are now going to do a little quiz .
I &apos;m going to give you a set of behaviors and activities , and you tell me if you think they will increase neurogenesis or if they will decrease neurogenesis .
Are we ready ?
OK , let &apos;s go .
So what about learning ?
Increasing ?
Yes .
Learning will increase the production of these new neurons .
How about stress ?
Yes , stress will decrease the production of new neurons in the hippocampus .
How about sleep deprivation ?
Indeed , it will decrease neurogenesis .
How about sex ?
Oh , wow !
( Laughter ) Yes , you are right , it will increase the production of new neurons .
However , it &apos;s all about balance here .
We don &apos;t want to fall in a situation — ( Laughter ) about too much sex leading to sleep deprivation . ( Laughter )
How about getting older ?
So the neurogenesis rate will decrease as we get older , but it is still occurring .
And then finally , how about running ?
I will let you judge that one by yourself .
So this is one of the first studies that was carried out by one of my mentors , Rusty Gage from the Salk Institute , showing that the environment can have an impact on the production of new neurons .
And here you see a section of the hippocampus of a mouse that had no running wheel in its cage .
And the little black dots you see are actually newborn neurons-to-be .
And now , you see a section of the hippocampus of a mouse that had a running wheel in its cage .
So you see the massive increase of the black dots representing the new neurons-to-be .
So activity impacts neurogenesis , but that &apos;s not all .
What you eat will have an effect on the production of new neurons in the hippocampus .
So here we have a sample of diet — of nutrients that have been shown to have efficacy .
And I &apos;m just going to point a few out to you : Calorie restriction of 20 to 30 percent will increase neurogenesis .
Intermittent fasting — spacing the time between your meals — will increase neurogenesis .
Intake of flavonoids , which are contained in dark chocolate or blueberries , will increase neurogenesis .
Omega-3 fatty acids , present in fatty fish , like salmon , will increase the production of these new neurons .
Conversely , a diet rich in high saturated fat will have a negative impact on neurogenesis .
Ethanol — intake of alcohol — will decrease neurogenesis .
However , not everything is lost ; resveratrol , which is contained in red wine , has been shown to promote the survival of these new neurons .
So next time you are at a dinner party , you might want to reach for this possibly &quot; &quot; neurogenesis-neutral &quot; &quot; drink .
( Laughter ) And then finally , let me point out the last one — a quirky one .
So Japanese groups are fascinated with food textures , and they have shown that actually soft diet impairs neurogenesis , as opposed to food that requires mastication — chewing — or crunchy food .
So all of this data , where we need to look at the cellular level , has been generated using animal models .
But this diet has also been given to human participants , and what we could see is that the diet modulates memory and mood in the same direction as it modulates neurogenesis , such as : calorie restriction will improve memory capacity , whereas a high-fat diet will exacerbate symptoms of depression — as opposed to omega-3 fatty acids , which increase neurogenesis , and also help to decrease the symptoms of depression .
So we think that the effect of diet on mental health , on memory and mood , is actually mediated by the production of the new neurons in the hippocampus .
And it &apos;s not only what you eat , but it &apos;s also the texture of the food , when you eat it and how much of it you eat .
On our side — neuroscientists interested in neurogenesis — we need to understand better the function of these new neurons , and how we can control their survival and their production .
We also need to find a way to protect the neurogenesis of Robert &apos;s patients .
And on your side — I leave you in charge of your neurogenesis .
Thank you .
Sandrine Thuret : Very good .
MH : I &apos;m really interested in the running thing .
Do I have to run ?
Or is it really just about aerobic exercise , getting oxygen to the brain ?
Could it be any kind of vigorous exercise ?
ST : So for the moment , we can &apos;t really say if it &apos;s just the running itself , but we think that anything that indeed will increase the production — or moving the blood flow to the brain , should be beneficial .
MH : So I don &apos;t have to get a running wheel in my office ?
ST : No , you don &apos;t !
MH : Oh , what a relief ! That &apos;s wonderful .
Sandrine Thuret , thank you so much .
ST : Thank you , Margaret .

And it takes place in an area called the Shephelah in what is now Israel .
And the reason the story obsessed me is that I thought I understood it , and then I went back over it and I realized that I didn &apos;t understand it at all .
Ancient Palestine had a — along its eastern border , there &apos;s a mountain range .
Still same is true of Israel today .
And in the mountain range are all of the ancient cities of that region , so Jerusalem , Bethlehem , Hebron .
And then there &apos;s a coastal plain along the Mediterranean , where Tel Aviv is now .
And connecting the mountain range with the coastal plain is an area called the Shephelah , which is a series of valleys and ridges that run east to west , and you can follow the Shephelah , go through the Shephelah to get from the coastal plain to the mountains .
And the Shephelah , if you &apos;ve been to Israel , you &apos;ll know it &apos;s just about the most beautiful part of Israel .
It &apos;s gorgeous , with forests of oak and wheat fields and vineyards .
But more importantly , though , in the history of that region , it &apos;s served , it &apos;s had a real strategic function , and that is , it is the means by which hostile armies on the coastal plain find their way , get up into the mountains and threaten those living in the mountains .
And 3,000 years ago , that &apos;s exactly what happens .
They &apos;re originally from Crete . They &apos;re a seafaring people .
And they may start to make their way through one of the valleys of the Shephelah up into the mountains , because what they want to do is occupy the highland area right by Bethlehem and split the Kingdom of Israel in two .
And the Kingdom of Israel , which is headed by King Saul , obviously catches wind of this , and Saul brings his army down from the mountains and he confronts the Philistines in the Valley of Elah , one of the most beautiful of the valleys of the Shephelah .
And the Israelites dig in along the northern ridge , and the Philistines dig in along the southern ridge , and the two armies just sit there for weeks and stare at each other , because they &apos;re deadlocked .
Neither can attack the other , because to attack the other side you &apos;ve got to come down the mountain into the valley and then up the other side , and you &apos;re completely exposed .
So finally , to break the deadlock , the Philistines send their mightiest warrior down into the valley floor , and he calls out and he says to the Israelites , &quot; &quot; Send your mightiest warrior down , and we &apos;ll have this out , just the two of us . &quot; &quot; This was a tradition in ancient warfare called single combat .
It was a way of settling disputes without incurring the bloodshed of a major battle .
And the Philistine who is sent down , their mighty warrior , is a giant .
He &apos;s 6 foot 9 .
He &apos;s outfitted head to toe in this glittering bronze armor , and he &apos;s got a sword and he &apos;s got a javelin and he &apos;s got his spear . He is absolutely terrifying .
And he &apos;s so terrifying that none of the Israelite soldiers want to fight him .
It &apos;s a death wish , right ? There &apos;s no way they think they can take him .
And finally the only person who will come forward is this young shepherd boy , and he goes up to Saul and he says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll fight him . &quot; &quot; And Saul says , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t fight him . That &apos;s ridiculous .
You &apos;re this kid . This is this mighty warrior . &quot; &quot; But the shepherd is adamant . He says , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you don &apos;t understand , I have been defending my flock against lions and wolves for years . I think I can do it . &quot; &quot; And Saul has no choice . He &apos;s got no one else who &apos;s come forward .
So he says , &quot; &quot; All right . &quot; &quot; And then he turns to the kid , and he says , &quot; But you &apos;ve got to wear this armor . You can &apos;t go as you are . &quot;
So he tries to give the shepherd his armor , and the shepherd says , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t wear this stuff . &quot; &quot; The Biblical verse is , &quot; &quot; I cannot wear this for I have not proved it , &quot; &quot; meaning , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve never worn armor before . You &apos;ve got to be crazy . &quot; &quot; So he reaches down instead on the ground and picks up five stones and puts them in his shepherd &apos;s bag and starts to walk down the mountainside to meet the giant .
And the giant sees this figure approaching , and calls out , &quot; &quot; Come to me so I can feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field . &quot; &quot; He issues this kind of taunt towards this person coming to fight him .
And the shepherd draws closer and closer , and the giant sees that he &apos;s carrying a staff .
That &apos;s all he &apos;s carrying .
Instead of a weapon , just this shepherd &apos;s staff , and he says — he &apos;s insulted — &quot; Am I a dog that you would come to me with sticks ? &quot;
And the shepherd boy takes one of his stones out of his pocket , puts it in his sling and rolls it around and lets it fly and it hits the giant right between the eyes — right here , in his most vulnerable spot — and he falls down either dead or unconscious , and the shepherd boy runs up and takes his sword and cuts off his head , and the Philistines see this and they turn and they just run .
And of course , the name of the giant is Goliath and the name of the shepherd boy is David , and the reason that story has obsessed me over the course of writing my book is that everything I thought I knew about that story turned out to be wrong .
So David , in that story , is supposed to be the underdog , right ?
In fact , that term , David and Goliath , has entered our language as a metaphor for improbable victories by some weak party over someone far stronger .
Now why do we call David an underdog ?
Well , we call him an underdog because he &apos;s a kid , a little kid , and Goliath is this big , strong giant .
We also call him an underdog because Goliath is an experienced warrior , and David is just a shepherd .
Well , let &apos;s start there with the phrase &quot; All David has is this sling , &quot; because that &apos;s the first mistake that we make .
In ancient warfare , there are three kinds of warriors .
There &apos;s cavalry , men on horseback and with chariots .
There &apos;s heavy infantry , which are foot soldiers , armed foot soldiers with swords and shields and some kind of armor .
And there &apos;s artillery , and artillery are archers , but , more importantly , slingers .
And a slinger is someone who has a leather pouch with two long cords attached to it , and they put a projectile , either a rock or a lead ball , inside the pouch , and they whirl it around like this and they let one of the cords go , and the effect is to send the projectile forward towards its target .
That &apos;s what David has , and it &apos;s important to understand that that sling is not a slingshot .
It &apos;s not this , right ? It &apos;s not a child &apos;s toy .
It &apos;s in fact an incredibly devastating weapon .
When David rolls it around like this , he &apos;s turning the sling around probably at six or seven revolutions per second , and that means that when the rock is released , it &apos;s going forward really fast , probably 35 meters per second .
That &apos;s substantially faster than a baseball thrown by even the finest of baseball pitchers .
More than that , the stones in the Valley of Elah were not normal rocks . They were barium sulphate , which are rocks twice the density of normal stones .
If you do the calculations on the ballistics , on the stopping power of the rock fired from David &apos;s sling , it &apos;s roughly equal to the stopping power of a &#91; .45 caliber &#93; handgun .
This is an incredibly devastating weapon .
Accuracy , we know from historical records that slingers — experienced slingers could hit and maim or even kill a target at distances of up to 200 yards .
From medieval tapestries , we know that slingers were capable of hitting birds in flight .
They were incredibly accurate .
When David lines up — and he &apos;s not 200 yards away from Goliath , he &apos;s quite close to Goliath — when he lines up and fires that thing at Goliath , he has every intention and every expectation of being able to hit Goliath at his most vulnerable spot between his eyes .
If you go back over the history of ancient warfare , you will find time and time again that slingers were the decisive factor against infantry in one kind of battle or another .
When he says , &quot; &quot; Come to me that I might feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field , &quot; &quot; the key phrase is &quot; &quot; Come to me . &quot; &quot; Come up to me because we &apos;re going to fight , hand to hand , like this .
Saul has the same expectation .
David says , &quot; &quot; I want to fight Goliath , &quot; &quot; and Saul tries to give him his armor , because Saul is thinking , &quot; &quot; Oh , when you say &apos; fight Goliath , &apos; you mean &apos; fight him in hand-to-hand combat , &apos; infantry on infantry . &quot; &quot; But David has absolutely no expectation .
He &apos;s not going to fight him that way . Why would he ?
He &apos;s a shepherd . He &apos;s spent his entire career using a sling to defend his flock against lions and wolves .
That &apos;s where his strength lies .
So here he is , this shepherd , experienced in the use of a devastating weapon , up against this lumbering giant weighed down by a hundred pounds of armor and these incredibly heavy weapons that are useful only in short-range combat .
Goliath is a sitting duck . He doesn &apos;t have a chance .
So why do we keep calling David an underdog , and why do we keep referring to his victory as improbable ?
There &apos;s a second piece of this that &apos;s important .
It &apos;s not just that we misunderstand David and his choice of weaponry .
It &apos;s also that we profoundly misunderstand Goliath .
Goliath is not what he seems to be .
There &apos;s all kinds of hints of this in the Biblical text , things that are in retrospect quite puzzling and don &apos;t square with his image as this mighty warrior .
So to begin with , the Bible says that Goliath is led onto the valley floor by an attendant .
Now that is weird , right ?
Here is this mighty warrior challenging the Israelites to one-on-one combat .
Why is he being led by the hand by some young boy , presumably , to the point of combat ?
Secondly , the Bible story makes special note of how slowly Goliath moves , another odd thing to say when you &apos;re describing the mightiest warrior known to man at that point .
And then there &apos;s this whole weird thing about how long it takes Goliath to react to the sight of David .
So David &apos;s coming down the mountain , and he &apos;s clearly not preparing for hand-to-hand combat .
There is nothing about him that says , &quot; I am about to fight you like this . &quot;
He &apos;s not even carrying a sword .
Why does Goliath not react to that ?
It &apos;s as if he &apos;s oblivious to what &apos;s going on that day .
And then there &apos;s that strange comment he makes to David : &quot; Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks ? &quot;
Sticks ? David only has one stick .
Well , it turns out that there &apos;s been a great deal of speculation within the medical community over the years about whether there is something fundamentally wrong with Goliath , an attempt to make sense of all of those apparent anomalies .
The first one was in 1960 in the Indiana Medical Journal , and it started a chain of speculation that starts with an explanation for Goliath &apos;s height .
So Goliath is head and shoulders above all of his peers in that era , and usually when someone is that far out of the norm , there &apos;s an explanation for it .
So the most common form of giantism is a condition called acromegaly , and acromegaly is caused by a benign tumor on your pituitary gland that causes an overproduction of human growth hormone .
And throughout history , many of the most famous giants have all had acromegaly .
So the tallest person of all time was a guy named Robert Wadlow who was still growing when he died at the age of 24 and he was 8 foot 11 .
He had acromegaly .
Do you remember the wrestler André the Giant ?
Famous . He had acromegaly .
There &apos;s even speculation that Abraham Lincoln had acromegaly .
Anyone who &apos;s unusually tall , that &apos;s the first explanation we come up with .
The pituitary tumor , as it grows , often starts to compress the visual nerves in your brain , with the result that people with acromegaly have either double vision or they are profoundly nearsighted .
Why does he move so slowly and have to be escorted down into the valley floor by an attendant ?
Because he can &apos;t make his way on his own .
Why is he so strangely oblivious to David that he doesn &apos;t understand that David &apos;s not going to fight him until the very last moment ?
Because he can &apos;t see him .
When he says , &quot; &quot; Come to me that I might feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field , &quot; &quot; the phrase &quot; &quot; come to me &quot; &quot; is a hint also of his vulnerability .
Come to me because I can &apos;t see you .
And then there &apos;s , &quot; &quot; Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks ? &quot; &quot; He sees two sticks when David has only one .
So the Israelites up on the mountain ridge looking down on him thought he was this extraordinarily powerful foe .
What they didn &apos;t understand was that the very thing that was the source of his apparent strength was also the source of his greatest weakness .
And there is , I think , in that , a very important lesson for all of us .
Giants are not as strong and powerful as they seem .
And sometimes the shepherd boy has a sling in his pocket .
Thank you .

When I was first learning to meditate , the instruction was to simply pay attention to my breath , and when my mind wandered , to bring it back .
Sounded simple enough .
Yet I &apos;d sit on these silent retreats , sweating through T-shirts in the middle of winter .
I &apos;d take naps every chance I got because it was really hard work .
Actually , it was exhausting .
The instruction was simple enough but I was missing something really important .
So why is it so hard to pay attention ?
Well , studies show that even when we &apos;re really trying to pay attention to something — like maybe this talk — at some point , about half of us will drift off into a daydream , or have this urge to check our Twitter feed .
So what &apos;s going on here ?
It turns out that we &apos;re fighting one of the most evolutionarily-conserved learning processes currently known in science , one that &apos;s conserved back to the most basic nervous systems known to man .
This reward-based learning process is called positive and negative reinforcement , and basically goes like this .
We see some food that looks good , our brain says , &quot; &quot; Calories ! ... Survival ! &quot; &quot; We eat the food , we taste it — it tastes good .
And especially with sugar , our bodies send a signal to our brain that says , &quot; Remember what you &apos;re eating and where you found it . &quot;
We lay down this context-dependent memory and learn to repeat the process next time .
See food , eat food , feel good , repeat .
Trigger , behavior , reward .
Simple , right ?
Well , after a while , our creative brains say , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
You can use this for more than just remembering where food is .
You know , next time you feel bad , why don &apos;t you try eating something good so you &apos;ll feel better ? &quot; &quot; We thank our brains for the great idea , try this and quickly learn that if we eat chocolate or ice cream when we &apos;re mad or sad , we feel better .
Same process , just a different trigger .
Instead of this hunger signal coming from our stomach , this emotional signal — feeling sad — triggers that urge to eat .
Maybe in our teenage years , we were a nerd at school , and we see those rebel kids outside smoking and we think , &quot; Hey , I want to be cool . &quot;
So we start smoking .
The Marlboro Man wasn &apos;t a dork , and that was no accident .
See cool , smoke to be cool , feel good . Repeat .
Trigger , behavior , reward .
And each time we do this , we learn to repeat the process and it becomes a habit .
So later , feeling stressed out triggers that urge to smoke a cigarette or to eat something sweet .
Now , with these same brain processes , we &apos;ve gone from learning to survive to literally killing ourselves with these habits .
Obesity and smoking are among the leading preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in the world .
So back to my breath .
What if instead of fighting our brains , or trying to force ourselves to pay attention , we instead tapped into this natural , reward-based learning process ...
but added a twist ?
What if instead we just got really curious about what was happening in our momentary experience ?
I &apos;ll give you an example .
In my lab , we studied whether mindfulness training could help people quit smoking .
Now , just like trying to force myself to pay attention to my breath , they could try to force themselves to quit smoking .
And the majority of them had tried this before and failed — on average , six times .
Now , with mindfulness training , we dropped the bit about forcing and instead focused on being curious .
In fact , we even told them to smoke .
What ? Yeah , we said , &quot; &quot; Go ahead and smoke , just be really curious about what it &apos;s like when you do . &quot; &quot; And what did they notice ?
Well here &apos;s an example from one of our smokers .
She said , &quot; &quot; Mindful smoking : smells like stinky cheese and tastes like chemicals , YUCK ! &quot; &quot; Now , she knew , cognitively that smoking was bad for her , that &apos;s why she joined our program .
What she discovered just by being curiously aware when she smoked was that smoking tastes like shit .
( Laughter ) Now , she moved from knowledge to wisdom .
She moved from knowing in her head that smoking was bad for her to knowing it in her bones , and the spell of smoking was broken .
She started to become disenchanted with her behavior .
Now , the prefrontal cortex , that youngest part of our brain from an evolutionary perspective , it understands on an intellectual level that we shouldn &apos;t smoke .
And it tries its hardest to help us change our behavior , to help us stop smoking , to help us stop eating that second , that third , that fourth cookie .
We call this cognitive control .
We &apos;re using cognition to control our behavior .
Unfortunately , this is also the first part of our brain that goes offline when we get stressed out , which isn &apos;t that helpful .
Now , we can all relate to this in our own experience .
We &apos;re much more likely to do things like yell at our spouse or kids when we &apos;re stressed out or tired , even though we know it &apos;s not going to be helpful .
We just can &apos;t help ourselves .
When the prefrontal cortex goes offline , we fall back into our old habits , which is why this disenchantment is so important .
Seeing what we get from our habits helps us understand them at a deeper level — to know it in our bones so we don &apos;t have to force ourselves to hold back or restrain ourselves from behavior .
We &apos;re just less interested in doing it in the first place .
And this is what mindfulness is all about : Seeing really clearly what we get when we get caught up in our behaviors , becoming disenchanted on a visceral level and from this disenchanted stance , naturally letting go .
This isn &apos;t to say that , poof , magically we quit smoking .
But over time , as we learn to see more and more clearly the results of our actions , we let go of old habits and form new ones .
The paradox here is that mindfulness is just about being really interested in getting close and personal with what &apos;s actually happening in our bodies and minds from moment to moment .
This willingness to turn toward our experience rather than trying to make unpleasant cravings go away as quickly as possible .
And this willingness to turn toward our experience is supported by curiosity , which is naturally rewarding .
What does curiosity feel like ?
It feels good .
And what happens when we get curious ?
We start to notice that cravings are simply made up of body sensations — oh , there &apos;s tightness , there &apos;s tension , there &apos;s restlessness — and that these body sensations come and go .
These are bite-size pieces of experiences that we can manage from moment to moment rather than getting clobbered by this huge , scary craving that we choke on .
In other words , when we get curious , we step out of our old , fear-based , reactive habit patterns , and we step into being .
We become this inner scientist where we &apos;re eagerly awaiting that next data point .
Now , this might sound too simplistic to affect behavior .
But in one study , we found that mindfulness training was twice as good as gold standard therapy at helping people quit smoking .
So it actually works .
And when we studied the brains of experienced meditators , we found that parts of a neural network of self-referential processing called the default mode network were at play .
Now , one current hypothesis is that a region of this network , called the posterior cingulate cortex , is activated not necessarily by craving itself but when we get caught up in it , when we get sucked in , and it takes us for a ride .
In contrast , when we let go — step out of the process just by being curiously aware of what &apos;s happening — this same brain region quiets down .
Now we &apos;re testing app and online-based mindfulness training programs that target these core mechanisms and , ironically , use the same technology that &apos;s driving us to distraction to help us step out of our unhealthy habit patterns of smoking , of stress eating and other addictive behaviors .
Now , remember that bit about context-dependent memory ?
We can deliver these tools to peoples &apos; fingertips in the contexts that matter most .
So we can help them tap into their inherent capacity to be curiously aware right when that urge to smoke or stress eat or whatever arises .
So if you don &apos;t smoke or stress eat , maybe the next time you feel this urge to check your email when you &apos;re bored , or you &apos;re trying to distract yourself from work , or maybe to compulsively respond to that text message when you &apos;re driving , see if you can tap into this natural capacity , just be curiously aware of what &apos;s happening in your body and mind in that moment .
It will just be another chance to perpetuate one of our endless and exhaustive habit loops ...
or step out of it .
Instead of see text message , compulsively text back , feel a little bit better — notice the urge , get curious , feel the joy of letting go and repeat .
Thank you .

A few years ago , my mom developed rheumatoid arthritis .
Her wrists , knees and toes swelled up , causing crippling , chronic pain .
She had to file for disability .
She stopped attending our local mosque .
Some mornings it was too painful for her to brush her teeth .
I wanted to help .
But I didn &apos;t know how .
I &apos;m not a doctor .
So , what I am is a historian of medicine .
So I started to research the history of chronic pain .
His name was John J. Bonica .
But when our story begins , he was better known as Johnny &quot; &quot; Bull &quot; &quot; Walker .
It was a summer day in 1941 .
The circus had just arrived in the tiny town of Brookfield , New York .
Spectators flocked to see the wire-walkers , the tramp clowns — if they were lucky , the human cannonball .
You know , on that particular day , a voice rang out over the circus P.A. system .
They needed a doctor urgently , in the live animal tent .
Something had gone wrong with the lion tamer .
He was running out of air ; the crowd watched in horror as he struggled and then passed out .
When the lion finally did relax its jaws , the lion tamer just slumped to the ground , motionless .
When he came to a few minutes later , he saw a familiar figure hunched over him .
It was Bull Walker .
The strongman had given the lion tamer mouth-to-mouth , and saved his life .
He toured with the circus during summers to pay tuition , but kept it a secret to protect his persona .
He was supposed to be a brute , a villain — not a nerdy do-gooder .
His medical colleagues didn &apos;t know his secret , either .
As he put it , &quot; &quot; If you were an athlete , you were a dumb dodo . &quot; &quot; So he didn &apos;t tell them about the circus , or about how he wrestled professionally on evenings and weekends .
He used a pseudonym like Bull Walker , or later , the Masked Marvel .
He even kept it a secret that same year , when he was crowned the Light Heavyweight Champion of the world .
Over the years , John J. Bonica lived these parallel lives .
He was a wrestler ; he was a doctor .
He was a heel ; he was a hero .
He inflicted pain , and he treated it .
And he didn ’ t know it at the time , but over the next five decades , he &apos;d draw on these dueling identities to forge a whole new way to think about pain .
It &apos;d change modern medicine so much so , that decades later , Time magazine would call him pain relief &apos;s founding father .
But that all happened later .
In 1942 , Bonica graduated medical school and married Emma , his sweetheart , whom he had met at one of his matches years before .
He still wrestled in secret — he had to .
With his championship belt , he wrestled in big-ticket venues , like Madison Square Garden , against big-time opponents , like Everett &quot; &quot; The Blonde Bear &quot; &quot; Marshall , or three-time world champion , Angelo Savoldi .
The matches took a toll on his body ; he tore hip joints , fractured ribs .
One night , The Terrible Turk &apos;s big toe scratched a scar like Capone &apos;s down the side of his face .
The next morning at work , he had to wear a surgical mask to hide it .
Twice Bonica showed up to the O.R. with one eye so bruised , he couldn &apos;t see out of it .
But worst of all were his mangled cauliflower ears .
He said they felt like two baseballs on the sides of his head .
Pain just kept accumulating in his life .
Next , he watched his wife go into labor at his hospital .
She heaved and pushed , clearly in anguish .
Her obstetrician called out to the intern on duty to give her a few drops of ether to ease her pain .
But the intern was a young guy , just three weeks on the job — he was jittery , and in applying the ether , irritated Emma &apos;s throat .
She vomited and choked , and started to turn blue .
Bonica , who was watching all this , pushed the intern out of the way , cleared her airway , and saved his wife and his unborn daughter .
At that moment , he decided to devote his life to anesthesiology .
Later , he &apos;d even go on to help develop the epidural , for delivering mothers .
Right around D-Day , Bonica showed up to Madigan Army Medical Center , near Tacoma .
At 7,700 beds , it was one of the largest army hospitals in America .
Bonica was in charge of all pain control there .
He was only 27 .
Treating so many patients , Bonica started noticing cases that contradicted everything he had learned .
Pain was supposed to be a kind of alarm bell — in a good way — a body &apos;s way of signaling an injury , like a broken arm .
But in some cases , like after a patient had a leg amputated , that patient might still complain of pain in that nonexistent leg .
But if the injury had been treated , why would the alarm bell keep ringing ?
There were other cases in which there was no evidence of an injury whatsoever , and yet , still the patient hurt .
Bonica tracked down all the specialists at his hospital — surgeons , neurologists , psychiatrists , others .
And he tried to get their opinions on his patients .
It took too long , so he started organizing group meetings over lunch .
It would be like a tag team of specialists going up against the patient &apos;s pain .
No one had ever focused on pain this way before .
After that , he hit the books .
He read every medical textbook he could get his hands on , carefully noting every mention of the word &quot; &quot; pain . &quot; &quot; Out of the 14,000 pages he read , the word &quot; &quot; pain &quot; &quot; was on 17 and a half of them .
Seventeen and a half .
For the most basic , most common , most frustrating part of being a patient .
The most important thing from the patient &apos;s perspective , they don &apos;t talk about . &quot; &quot; So over the next eight years , Bonica would talk about it .
He &apos;d write about it ; he &apos;d write those missing pages .
He wrote what would later be known as the Bible of Pain .
In it he proposed new strategies , new treatments using nerve-block injections .
He proposed a new institution , the Pain Clinic , based on those lunchtime meetings .
But the most important thing about his book was that it was kind of an emotional alarm bell for medicine .
A desperate plea to doctors to take pain seriously in patients &apos; lives .
He recast the very purpose of medicine .
The goal wasn &apos;t to make patients better ; it was to make patients feel better .
He pushed his pain agenda for decades , before it finally took hold in the mid- &apos; 70s .
Hundreds of pain clinics sprung up all over the world .
But as they did — a tragic twist .
Bonica &apos;s years of wrestling caught up to him .
He had been out of the ring for over 20 years , but those 1,500 professional bouts had left a mark on his body .
Still in his mid-50s , he suffered severe osteoarthritis .
Over the next 20 years he &apos;d have 22 surgeries , including four spine operations , and hip replacement after hip replacement .
He could barely raise his arm , turn his neck .
He needed aluminum crutches to walk .
His friends and former students became his doctors .
One recalled that he probably had more nerve-block injections than anyone else on the planet .
Already a workaholic , he worked even more — 15- to 18-hour days .
Healing others became more than just his job , it was his own most effective form of relief .
&quot; &quot; If I wasn &apos;t as busy as I am , &quot; &quot; he told a reporter at the time , &quot; I would be a completely disabled guy . &quot;
On a business trip to Florida in the early 1980s , Bonica got a former student to drive him to the Hyde Park area in Tampa .
They drove past palm trees and pulled up to an old mansion , with giant silver howitzer cannons hidden in the garage .
The house belonged to the Zacchini family , who were something like American circus royalty .
Decades earlier , Bonica had watched them , clad in silver jumpsuits and goggles , doing the act they pioneered — the Human Cannonball .
But now they were like him : retired .
That generation is all dead now , including Bonica , so there &apos;s no way to know exactly what they said that day .
But still , I love imagining it .
The strongman and the human cannonballs reunited , showing off old scars , and new ones .
Maybe Bonica gave them medical advice .
Maybe he told them what he later said in an oral history , which is that his time in the circus and wrestling deeply molded his life .
Bonica saw pain close up .
He felt it . He lived it .
And it made it impossible for him to ignore in others .
That was definitely true for Bonica .
But it was also true for my mom .
It &apos;s easy for doctors to see my mom as a kind of professional patient , a woman who just spends her days in waiting rooms .
Sometimes I get stuck seeing her that same way .
But as I saw Bonica &apos;s pain — a testament to his fully lived life — I started to remember all the things that my mom &apos;s pain holds .
Before they got swollen and arthritic , my mom &apos;s fingers clacked away in the hospital H.R. department where she worked .
They folded samosas for our entire mosque .
When I was a kid , they cut my hair , wiped my nose , tied my shoes .
Thank you .

So , this is a story about how we know what we know .
It &apos;s a story about this woman , Natalia Rybczynski .
She &apos;s a paleobiologist , which means she specializes in digging up really old dead stuff .
( Audio ) Natalia Rybczynski : Yeah , I had someone call me &quot; &quot; Dr. Dead Things . &quot; &quot; Latif Nasser : And I think she &apos;s particularly interesting because of where she digs that stuff up , way above the Arctic Circle in the remote Canadian tundra .
Now , one summer day in 2006 , she was at a dig site called the Fyles Leaf Bed , which is less than 10 degrees latitude away from the magnetic north pole .
( Audio ) NR : Really , it &apos;s not going to sound very exciting , because it was a day of walking with your backpack and your GPS and notebook and just picking up anything that might be a fossil .
LN : And at some point , she noticed something .
( Audio ) NR : Rusty , kind of rust-colored , about the size of the palm of my hand .
It was just lying on the surface .
LN : And at first she thought it was just a splinter of wood , because that &apos;s the sort of thing people had found at the Fyles Leaf Bed before — prehistoric plant parts .
But that night , back at camp ...
( Audio ) NR : ... I get out the hand lens , I &apos;m looking a little bit more closely and realizing it doesn &apos;t quite look like this has tree rings .
Maybe it &apos;s a preservation thing , but it looks really like ...
bone .
LN : Huh . So over the next four years , she went to that spot over and over , and eventually collected 30 fragments of that exact same bone , most of them really tiny .
( Audio ) NR : It &apos;s not a whole lot . It fits in a small Ziploc bag .
LN : And she tried to piece them together like a jigsaw puzzle .
But it was challenging .
( Audio ) NR : It &apos;s broken up into so many little tiny pieces , I &apos;m trying to use sand and putty , and it &apos;s not looking good .
So finally , we used a 3D surface scanner .
LN : Ooh ! NR : Yeah , right ?
( Laughter ) LN : It turns out it was way easier to do it virtually .
( Audio ) NR : It &apos;s kind of magical when it all fits together .
LN : How certain were you that you had it right , that you had put it together in the right way ?
Was there a potential that you &apos;d put it together a different way and have , like , a parakeet or something ?
( Laughter ) ( Audio ) NR : ( Laughs ) Um , no . No , we got this .
LN : What she had , she discovered , was a tibia , a leg bone , and specifically , one that belonged to a cloven-hoofed mammal , so something like a cow or a sheep .
But it couldn &apos;t have been either of those .
It was just too big .
( Audio ) NR : The size of this thing , it was huge . It &apos;s a really big animal .
LN : So what animal could it be ?
Having hit a wall , she showed one of the fragments to some colleagues of hers in Colorado , and they had an idea .
( Audio ) NR : We took a saw , and we nicked just the edge of it , and there was this really interesting smell that comes from it .
LN : It smelled kind of like singed flesh .
It was a smell that Natalia recognized from cutting up skulls in her gross anatomy lab : collagen .
Collagen is what gives structure to our bones .
And usually , after so many years , it breaks down .
But in this case , the Arctic had acted like a natural freezer and preserved it .
Then a year or two later , Natalia was at a conference in Bristol , and she saw that a colleague of hers named Mike Buckley was demoing this new process that he called &quot; &quot; collagen fingerprinting . &quot; &quot; It turns out that different species have slightly different structures of collagen , so if you get a collagen profile of an unknown bone , you can compare it to those of known species , and , who knows , maybe you get a match .
So she shipped him one of the fragments , FedEx .
( Audio ) NR : Yeah , you want to track it . It &apos;s kind of important .
( Laughter ) LN : And he processed it , and compared it to 37 known and modern-day mammal species .
And he found a match .
It turns out that the 3.5 million-year-old bone that Natalia had dug out of the High Arctic belonged to ...
a camel .
( Laughter ) ( Audio ) NR : And I &apos;m thinking , what ? That &apos;s amazing — if it &apos;s true .
LN : So they tested a bunch of the fragments , and they got the same result for each one .
However , based on the size of the bone that they found , it meant that this camel was 30 percent larger than modern-day camels .
So this camel would have been about nine feet tall , weighed around a ton .
( Audience reacts ) Yeah .
Natalia had found a Giant Arctic camel .
( Laughter ) Now , when you hear the word &quot; &quot; camel , &quot; &quot; what may come to mind is one of these , the Bactrian camel of East and Central Asia .
But chances are the postcard image you have in your brain is one of these , the dromedary , quintessential desert creature — hangs out in sandy , hot places like the Middle East and the Sahara , has a big old hump on its back for storing water for those long desert treks , has big , broad feet to help it tromp over sand dunes .
So how on earth would one of these guys end up in the High Arctic ?
Well , scientists have known for a long time , turns out , even before Natalia &apos;s discovery , that camels are actually originally American .
( Music : The Star-Spangled Banner ) ( Laughter ) They started here .
For nearly 40 of the 45 million years that camels have been around , you could only find them in North America , around 20 different species , maybe more .
( Audio ) LN : If I put them all in a lineup , would they look different ?
NR : Yeah , you &apos;re going to have different body sizes .
You &apos;ll have some with really long necks , so they &apos;re actually functionally like giraffes .
LN : Some had snouts , like crocodiles .
( Audio ) NR : The really primitive , early ones would have been really small , almost like rabbits .
LN : What ? Rabbit-sized camels ?
( Audio ) NR : The earliest ones .
So those ones you probably would not recognize .
LN : Oh my God , I want a pet rabbit-camel .
( Audio ) NR : I know , wouldn &apos;t that be great ?
( Laughter ) LN : And then about three to seven million years ago , one branch of camels went down to South America , where they became llamas and alpacas , and another branch crossed over the Bering Land Bridge into Asia and Africa .
And then around the end of the last ice age , North American camels went extinct .
So , scientists knew all of that already , but it still doesn &apos;t fully explain how Natalia found one so far north .
Like , this is , temperature-wise , the polar opposite of the Sahara .
Now to be fair , three and a half million years ago , it was on average 22 degrees Celsius warmer than it is now .
So it would have been boreal forest , so more like the Yukon or Siberia today .
But still , like , they would have six-month-long winters where the ponds would freeze over .
You &apos;d have blizzards .
You &apos;d have 24 hours a day of straight darkness .
Like , how ... How ?
How is it that one of these Saharan superstars could ever have survived those arctic conditions ?
( Laughter ) Natalia and her colleagues think they have an answer .
And it &apos;s kind of brilliant .
What if the very features that we imagine make the camel so well-suited to places like the Sahara , actually evolved to help it get through the winter ?
What if those broad feet were meant to tromp not over sand , but over snow , like a pair of snowshoes ?
What if that hump — which , huge news to me , does not contain water , it contains fat — ( Laughter ) was there to help the camel get through that six-month-long winter , when food was scarce ?
And then , only later , long after it crossed over the land bridge did it retrofit those winter features for a hot desert environment ?
Like , for instance , the hump may be helpful to camels in hotter climes because having all your fat in one place , like a , you know , fat backpack , means that you don &apos;t have to have that insulation all over the rest of your body .
So it helps heat dissipate easier .
It &apos;s this crazy idea , that what seems like proof of the camel &apos;s quintessential desert nature could actually be proof of its High Arctic past .
Now , I &apos;m not the first person to tell this story .
Others have told it as a way to marvel at evolutionary biology or as a keyhole into the future of climate change .
But I love it for a totally different reason .
For me , it &apos;s a story about us , about how we see the world and about how that changes .
So I was trained as a historian .
And I &apos;ve learned that , actually , a lot of scientists are historians , too .
They make sense of the past .
They tell the history of our universe , of our planet , of life on this planet .
And as a historian , you start with an idea in your mind of how the story goes .
( Audio ) NR : We make up stories and we stick with it , like the camel in the desert , right ?
That &apos;s a great story ! It &apos;s totally adapted for that .
Clearly , it always lived there .
LN : But at any moment , you could uncover some tiny bit of evidence .
You could learn some tiny thing that forces you to reframe everything you thought you knew .
Like , in this case , this one scientist finds this one shard of what she thought was wood , and because of that , science has a totally new and totally counterintuitive theory about why this absurd Dr. Seuss-looking creature looks the way it does .
And for me , it completely upended the way I think of the camel .
It went from being this ridiculously niche creature suited only to this one specific environment , to being this world traveler that just happens to be in the Sahara , and could end up virtually anywhere .
( Applause ) This is Azuri .
Azuri , hi , how are you doing ?
OK , here , I &apos;ve got one of these for you here .
( Laughter ) So Azuri is on a break from her regular gig at the Radio City Music Hall . ( Laughter )
That &apos;s not even a joke .
Anyway — But really , Azuri is here as a living reminder that the story of our world is a dynamic one .
It requires our willingness to readjust , to reimagine .
( Laughter ) Right , Azuri ?
And , really , that we &apos;re all just one shard of bone away from seeing the world anew .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
And that &apos;s hard to do if you don &apos;t know who you are .
But I kept dreaming .
Like a boomerang , the thing I loved came back to me .
I gave myself a hall pass to get through each broken promise .
One day , before I realized fat kids are not designed to climb trees , I fell out of a tree and bruised the right side of my body .
Maybe they decided to pick you last for basketball or everything .
We are not abandoned cars stalled out and sitting empty on some highway , and if in some way we are , don &apos;t worry .
And my father smiled and said , &quot; Well , you know what that means , don &apos;t you ? &quot;
It was pretty obvious that it was really our parents giving us the presents .
( Laughter ) And this meant that I was a Libra ?
He led them to America .
I &apos;m just so used to that story .
Because I wasn &apos;t exactly sure how I felt about that question .
Fifty years ago , when I began exploring the ocean , no one — not Jacques Perrin , not Jacques Cousteau or Rachel Carson — imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it .
It seemed , at that time , to be a sea of Eden , but now we know , and now we are facing paradise lost .
I want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us , and to consider why it matters that in 50 years , we &apos;ve lost — actually , we &apos;ve taken , we &apos;ve eaten — more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea ; why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared ; why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the Pacific should concern not only the creatures that are dying , but it really should concern you .
It does concern you , as well .
I &apos;m haunted by the thought of what Ray Anderson calls &quot; &quot; tomorrow &apos;s child , &quot; &quot; asking why we didn &apos;t do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean while there still was time .
Well , now is that time .
I hope for your help to explore and protect the wild ocean in ways that will restore the health and , in so doing , secure hope for humankind .
Health to the ocean means health for us .
And I hope Jill Tarter &apos;s wish to engage Earthlings includes dolphins and whales and other sea creatures in this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe .
And I hope , Jill , that someday we will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet .
( Laughter ) Did I say that ? I guess I did .
For me , as a scientist , it all began in 1953 when I first tried scuba .
It &apos;s when I first got to know fish swimming in something other than lemon slices and butter .
I actually love diving at night ; you see a lot of fish then that you don &apos;t see in the daytime .
Diving day and night was really easy for me in 1970 , when I led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time — at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon .
In 1979 I had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor while using this personal submersible called Jim .
It was six miles offshore and 1,250 feet down .
It &apos;s one of my favorite bathing suits .
Since then , I &apos;ve used about 30 kinds of submarines and I &apos;ve started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called Deep Search to design and build systems to access the deep sea .
I led a five-year National Geographic expedition , the Sustainable Seas expeditions , using these little subs .
They &apos;re so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it .
And I &apos;m living proof .
Astronauts and aquanauts alike really appreciate the importance of air , food , water , temperature — all the things you need to stay alive in space or under the sea .
I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system and then do everything he could to take care of his life support system ; and then he pointed to this and he said , &quot; &quot; Life support system . &quot; &quot; We need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it .
The poet Auden said , &quot; &quot; Thousands have lived without love ; none without water . &quot; &quot; Ninety-seven percent of Earth &apos;s water is ocean .
No blue , no green .
If you think the ocean isn &apos;t important , imagine Earth without it .
Mars comes to mind .
No ocean , no life support system .
I gave a talk not so long ago at the World Bank and I showed this amazing image of Earth and I said , &quot; &quot; There it is ! The World Bank ! &quot; &quot; That &apos;s where all the assets are !
And we &apos;ve been trawling them down much faster than the natural systems can replenish them .
Tim Worth says the economy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the environment .
With every drop of water you drink , every breath you take , you &apos;re connected to the sea .
No matter where on Earth you live .
Most of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea .
Over time , most of the planet &apos;s organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there , mostly by microbes .
The ocean drives climate and weather , stabilizes temperature , shapes Earth &apos;s chemistry .
Water from the sea forms clouds that return to the land and the seas as rain , sleet and snow , and provides home for about 97 percent of life in the world , maybe in the universe .
No water , no life ; no blue , no green .
Yet we have this idea , we humans , that the Earth — all of it : the oceans , the skies — are so vast and so resilient it doesn &apos;t matter what we do to it .
That may have been true 10,000 years ago , and maybe even 1,000 years ago but in the last 100 , especially in the last 50 , we &apos;ve drawn down the assets , the air , the water , the wildlife that make our lives possible .
New technologies are helping us to understand the nature of nature ; the nature of what &apos;s happening , showing us our impact on the Earth .
I mean , first you have to know that you &apos;ve got a problem .
And fortunately , in our time , we &apos;ve learned more about the problems than in all preceding history .
And with knowing comes caring .
And with caring , there &apos;s hope that we can find an enduring place for ourselves within the natural systems that support us .
But first we have to know .
Three years ago , I met John Hanke , who &apos;s the head of Google Earth , and I told him how much I loved being able to hold the world in my hands and go exploring vicariously .
But I asked him : &quot; &quot; When are you going to finish it ?
You did a great job with the land , the dirt .
What about the water ? &quot; &quot; Since then , I &apos;ve had the great pleasure of working with the Googlers , with DOER Marine , with National Geographic , with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world , ones that we could enlist , to put the ocean in Google Earth .
And as of just this week , last Monday , Google Earth is now whole .
Consider this : Starting right here at the convention center , we can find the nearby aquarium , we can look at where we &apos;re sitting , and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium , the ocean , and California &apos;s four national marine sanctuaries , and the new network of state marine reserves that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets We can flit over to Hawaii and see the real Hawaiian Islands : not just the little bit that pokes through the surface , but also what &apos;s below .
To see — wait a minute , we can go kshhplash ! — right there , ha — under the ocean , see what the whales see .
We can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands .
We can go actually and swim around on Google Earth and visit with humpback whales .
These are the gentle giants that I &apos;ve had the pleasure of meeting face to face many times underwater .
There &apos;s nothing quite like being personally inspected by a whale .
We can pick up and fly to the deepest place : seven miles down , the Mariana Trench , where only two people have ever been .
Imagine that . It &apos;s only seven miles , but only two people have been there , 49 years ago .
One-way trips are easy .
We need new deep-diving submarines .
How about some X Prizes for ocean exploration ?
We need to see deep trenches , the undersea mountains , and understand life in the deep sea .
We can now go to the Arctic .
Just ten years ago I stood on the ice at the North Pole .
An ice-free Arctic Ocean may happen in this century .
That &apos;s bad news for the polar bears .
That &apos;s bad news for us too .
Excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming , it &apos;s also changing ocean chemistry , making the sea more acidic .
That &apos;s bad news for coral reefs and oxygen-producing plankton .
Also it &apos;s bad news for us .
We &apos;re putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea .
Millions of tons of discarded fishing nets , gear that continues to kill .
We &apos;re clogging the ocean , poisoning the planet &apos;s circulatory system , and we &apos;re taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife , all carbon-based units .
Barbarically , we &apos;re killing sharks for shark fin soup , undermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry and drive the carbon cycle , the nitrogen cycle , the oxygen cycle , the water cycle — our life support system .
We &apos;re still killing bluefin tuna ; truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead .
All of these parts are part of our life support system .
We kill using long lines , with baited hooks every few feet that may stretch for 50 miles or more .
Industrial trawlers and draggers are scraping the sea floor like bulldozers , taking everything in their path .
Using Google Earth you can witness trawlers — in China , the North Sea , the Gulf of Mexico — shaking the foundation of our life support system , leaving plumes of death in their path .
The next time you dine on sushi — or sashimi , or swordfish steak , or shrimp cocktail , whatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean — think of the real cost .
For every pound that goes to market , more than 10 pounds , even 100 pounds , may be thrown away as bycatch .
This is the consequence of not knowing that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea .
This chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife from 1900 to 2000 .
The highest concentrations are in red .
In my lifetime , imagine , 90 percent of the big fish have been killed .
Most of the turtles , sharks , tunas and whales are way down in numbers .
But , there is good news .
Ten percent of the big fish still remain .
There are still some blue whales .
There are still some krill in Antarctica .
There are a few oysters in Chesapeake Bay .
Half the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape , a jeweled belt around the middle of the planet .
There &apos;s still time , but not a lot , to turn things around .
But business as usual means that in 50 years , there may be no coral reefs — and no commercial fishing , because the fish will simply be gone .
Imagine the ocean without fish .
Imagine what that means to our life support system .
Natural systems on the land are in big trouble too , but the problems are more obvious , and some actions are being taken to protect trees , watersheds and wildlife .
And in 1872 , with Yellowstone National Park , the United States began establishing a system of parks that some say was the best idea America ever had .
About 12 percent of the land around the world is now protected : safeguarding biodiversity , providing a carbon sink , generating oxygen , protecting watersheds .
And , in 1972 , this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea , National Marine Sanctuaries .
That &apos;s another great idea .
The good news is that there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea , around the world , that have some kind of protection .
And you can find them on Google Earth .
The bad news is that you have to look hard to find them .
In the last three years , for example , the U.S. protected 340,000 square miles of ocean as national monuments .
But it only increased from 0.6 of one percent to 0.8 of one percent of the ocean protected , globally .
Protected areas do rebound , but it takes a long time to restore 50-year-old rockfish or monkfish , sharks or sea bass , or 200-year-old orange roughy .
We don &apos;t consume 200-year-old cows or chickens .
Protected areas provide hope that the creatures of Ed Wilson &apos;s dream of an encyclopedia of life , or the census of marine life , will live not just as a list , a photograph , or a paragraph .
With scientists around the world , I &apos;ve been looking at the 99 percent of the ocean that is open to fishing — and mining , and drilling , and dumping , and whatever — to search out hope spots , and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future .
Such as the Arctic — we have one chance , right now , to get it right .
Or the Antarctic , where the continent is protected , but the surrounding ocean is being stripped of its krill , whales and fish .
Sargasso Sea &apos;s three million square miles of floating forest is being gathered up to feed cows .
97 percent of the land in the Galapagos Islands is protected , but the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing .
It &apos;s true too in Argentina on the Patagonian shelf , which is now in serious trouble .
The high seas , where whales , tuna and dolphins travel — the largest , least protected , ecosystem on Earth , filled with luminous creatures , living in dark waters that average two miles deep .
They flash , and sparkle , and glow with their own living light .
There are still places in the sea as pristine as I knew as a child .
The next 10 years may be the most important , and the next 10,000 years the best chance our species will have to protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life .
To cope with climate change , we need new ways to generate power .
We need new ways , better ways , to cope with poverty , wars and disease .
We need many things to keep and maintain the world as a better place .
But , nothing else will matter if we fail to protect the ocean .
Our fate and the ocean &apos;s are one .
We need to do for the ocean what Al Gore did for the skies above .
A global plan of action with a world conservation union , the IUCN , is underway to protect biodiversity , to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change , on the high seas and in coastal areas , wherever we can identify critical places .
New technologies are needed to map , photograph and explore the 95 percent of the ocean that we have yet to see .
The goal is to protect biodiversity , to provide stability and resilience .
We need deep-diving subs , new technologies to explore the ocean .
We need , maybe , an expedition — a TED at sea — that could help figure out the next steps .
And so , I suppose you want to know what my wish is .
I wish you would use all means at your disposal — films , expeditions , the web , new submarines — and campaign to ignite public support for a global network of marine protected areas — hope spots large enough to save and restore the ocean , the blue heart of the planet .
How much ?
Some say 10 percent , some say 30 percent .
You decide : how much of your heart do you want to protect ?
Whatever it is , a fraction of one percent is not enough .
My wish is a big wish , but if we can make it happen , it can truly change the world , and help ensure the survival of what actually — as it turns out — is my favorite species ; that would be us .
For the children of today , for tomorrow &apos;s child : as never again , now is the time .
Thank you .

I was only four years old when I saw my mother load a washing machine for the very first time in her life .
That was a great day for my mother .
My mother and father had been saving money for years to be able to buy that machine , and the first day it was going to be used , even Grandma was invited to see the machine .
And Grandma was even more excited .
Throughout her life she had been heating water with firewood , and she had hand washed laundry for seven children .
And now she was going to watch electricity do that work .
And then , when she closed the door , Grandma said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , no .
Let me , let me push the button . &quot; &quot; And Grandma pushed the button , and she said , &quot; &quot; Oh , fantastic !
She was mesmerized .
Today , in Sweden and other rich countries , people are using so many different machines .
Look , the homes are full of machines .
I can &apos;t even name them all .
And they also , when they want to travel , they use flying machines that can take them to remote destinations .
I &apos;ve done the scrutiny of market data , and I &apos;ve found that , indeed , the washing machine has penetrated below the air line , and today there &apos;s an additional one billion people out there who live above the &quot; &quot; wash line . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And they consume more than $ 40 per day .
So two billion have access to washing machines .
And the remaining five billion , how do they wash ?
Or , to be more precise , how do most of the women in the world wash ?
They wash like this : by hand .
And they want the washing machine .
They want the washing machine in exactly the same way .
But when I lecture to environmentally-concerned students , they tell me , &quot; &quot; No , everybody in the world cannot have cars and washing machines . &quot; &quot; How can we tell this woman that she ain &apos;t going to have a washing machine ?
Look here , you see the seven billion people up there : the air people , the wash people , the bulb people and the fire people .
One unit like this is an energy unit of fossil fuel — oil , coal or gas .
That &apos;s what most of electricity and the energy in the world is .
And it &apos;s 12 units used in the entire world , and the richest one billion , they use six of them .
Half of the energy is used by one seventh of the world &apos;s population .
And these ones who have washing machines , but not a house full of other machines , they use two .
This group uses three , one each .
And they also have electricity .
And over there they don &apos;t even use one each .
That makes 12 of them .
But the main concern for the environmentally-interested students — and they are right — is about the future .
What are the trends ? If we just prolong the trends , without any real advanced analysis , to 2050 , there are two things that can increase the energy use .
First , population growth .
Second , economic growth .
Population growth will mainly occur among the poorest people here because they have high child mortality and they have many children per woman .
And &#91; with &#93; that you will get two extra , but that won &apos;t change the energy use very much .
What will happen is economic growth .
&quot; &quot; Wopp ! &quot; &quot; they will say .
And they will start to use as much as the Old West are doing already .
And these people , they want the washing machine .
I told you . They &apos;ll go there .
And they will double their energy use .
And we hope that the poor people will get into the electric light .
And these 22 units — still the richest people use most of it .
So what needs to be done ?
Because the risk , the high probability of climate change is real .
It &apos;s real .
Of course they must be more energy-efficient .
But I can assure you that this woman in the favela in Rio , she wants a washing machine .
And what &apos;s the magic with them ?
My mother explained the magic with this machine the very , very first day .
And mother got time to read for me .
And she also got books for herself .
She managed to study English and learn that as a foreign language .
And she read so many novels , so many different novels here .
And we really , we really loved this machine .
And what we said , my mother and me , &quot; &quot; Thank you industrialization .
Thank you steel mill .
Thank you power station .
And thank you chemical processing industry that gave us time to read books . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
( Applause )
What is going to be the future of learning ?
I do have a plan , but in order for me to tell you what that plan is , I need to tell you a little story , which kind of sets the stage .
I tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools , where did it come from ?
And you can look far back into the past , but if you look at present-day schooling the way it is , it &apos;s quite easy to figure out where it came from .
It came from about 300 years ago , and it came from the last and the biggest of the empires on this planet . &#91; &quot; &quot; The British Empire &quot; &quot; &#93; Imagine trying to run the show , trying to run the entire planet , without computers , without telephones , with data handwritten on pieces of paper , and traveling by ships .
But the Victorians actually did it .
What they did was amazing .
They created a global computer made up of people .
It &apos;s still with us today .
It &apos;s called the bureaucratic administrative machine .
In order to have that machine running , you need lots and lots of people .
They made another machine to produce those people : the school .
The schools would produce the people who would then become parts of the bureaucratic administrative machine .
They must be identical to each other .
They must know three things : They must have good handwriting , because the data is handwritten ; they must be able to read ; and they must be able to do multiplication , division , addition and subtraction in their head .
They must be so identical that you could pick one up from New Zealand and ship them to Canada and he would be instantly functional .
The Victorians were great engineers .
They engineered a system that was so robust that it &apos;s still with us today , continuously producing identical people for a machine that no longer exists .
The empire is gone , so what are we doing with that design that produces these identical people , and what are we going to do next if we ever are going to do anything else with it ?
&#91; &quot; &quot; Schools as we know them are obsolete &quot; &quot; &#93; So that &apos;s a pretty strong comment there .
I said schools as we know them now , they &apos;re obsolete .
I &apos;m not saying they &apos;re broken .
It &apos;s quite fashionable to say that the education system &apos;s broken .
It &apos;s not broken . It &apos;s wonderfully constructed .
It &apos;s just that we don &apos;t need it anymore . It &apos;s outdated .
What are the kind of jobs that we have today ?
Well , the clerks are the computers .
They &apos;re there in thousands in every office .
And you have people who guide those computers to do their clerical jobs .
Those people don &apos;t need to be able to write beautifully by hand .
They don &apos;t need to be able to multiply numbers in their heads .
They do need to be able to read .
In fact , they need to be able to read discerningly .
Well , that &apos;s today , but we don &apos;t even know what the jobs of the future are going to look like .
We know that people will work from wherever they want , whenever they want , in whatever way they want .
How is present-day schooling going to prepare them for that world ?
I used to teach people how to write computer programs in New Delhi , 14 years ago .
And right next to where I used to work , there was a slum .
And I used to think , how on Earth are those kids ever going to learn to write computer programs ?
Or should they not ?
At the same time , we also had lots of parents , rich people , who had computers , and who used to tell me , &quot; &quot; You know , my son , I think he &apos;s gifted , because he does wonderful things with computers .
And my daughter — oh , surely she is extra-intelligent . &quot; &quot; And so on . So I suddenly figured that , how come all the rich people are having these extraordinarily gifted children ?
( Laughter ) What did the poor do wrong ?
I made a hole in the boundary wall of the slum next to my office , and stuck a computer inside it just to see what would happen if I gave a computer to children who never would have one , didn &apos;t know any English , didn &apos;t know what the Internet was .
The children came running in .
It was three feet off the ground , and they said , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Why have you put it there ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Just like that . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Can we touch it ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; If you wish to . &quot; &quot; And I went away .
About eight hours later , we found them browsing and teaching each other how to browse .
So I said , &quot; &quot; Well that &apos;s impossible , because — How is it possible ? They don &apos;t know anything . &quot; &quot; My colleagues said , &quot; &quot; No , it &apos;s a simple solution .
One of your students must have been passing by , showed them how to use the mouse . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , that &apos;s possible . &quot; &quot; So I repeated the experiment . I went 300 miles out of Delhi into a really remote village where the chances of a passing software development engineer was very little . ( Laughter ) I repeated the experiment there .
There was no place to stay , so I stuck my computer in , I went away , came back after a couple of months , found kids playing games on it .
When they saw me , they said , &quot; We want a faster processor and a better mouse . &quot;
( Laughter ) So I said , &quot; &quot; How on Earth do you know all this ? &quot; &quot; And they said something very interesting to me .
In an irritated voice , they said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve given us a machine that works only in English , so we had to teach ourselves English in order to use it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) That &apos;s the first time , as a teacher , that I had heard the word &quot; &quot; teach ourselves &quot; &quot; said so casually .
Here &apos;s a short glimpse from those years .
That &apos;s the first day at the Hole in the Wall .
On your right is an eight-year-old .
To his left is his student . She &apos;s six .
And he &apos;s teaching her how to browse .
Then onto other parts of the country , I repeated this over and over again , getting exactly the same results that we were .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Hole in the wall film - 1999 &quot; &quot; &#93; An eight-year-old telling his elder sister what to do .
And finally a girl explaining in Marathi what it is , and said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a processor inside . &quot; &quot; So I started publishing .
I published everywhere . I wrote down and measured everything , and I said , in nine months , a group of children left alone with a computer in any language will reach the same standard as an office secretary in the West .
I &apos;d seen it happen over and over and over again .
But I was curious to know , what else would they do if they could do this much ?
I started experimenting with other subjects , among them , for example , pronunciation .
There &apos;s one community of children in southern India whose English pronunciation is really bad , and they needed good pronunciation because that would improve their jobs .
I gave them a speech-to-text engine in a computer , and I said , &quot; &quot; Keep talking into it until it types what you say . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They did that , and watch a little bit of this .
Computer : Nice to meet you.Child : Nice to meet you .
Sugata Mitra : The reason I ended with the face of this young lady over there is because I suspect many of you know her .
She has now joined a call center in Hyderabad and may have tortured you about your credit card bills in a very clear English accent .
So then people said , well , how far will it go ?
Where does it stop ?
I decided I would destroy my own argument by creating an absurd proposition .
I made a hypothesis , a ridiculous hypothesis .
Tamil is a south Indian language , and I said , can Tamil-speaking children in a south Indian village learn the biotechnology of DNA replication in English from a streetside computer ?
And I said , I &apos;ll measure them . They &apos;ll get a zero .
I &apos;ll spend a couple of months , I &apos;ll leave it for a couple of months , I &apos;ll go back , they &apos;ll get another zero .
I &apos;ll go back to the lab and say , we need teachers .
I found a village . It was called Kallikuppam in southern India .
I put in Hole in the Wall computers there , downloaded all kinds of stuff from the Internet about DNA replication , most of which I didn &apos;t understand .
The children came rushing , said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s all this ? &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s very topical , very important . But it &apos;s all in English . &quot; &quot; So they said , &quot; &quot; How can we understand such big English words and diagrams and chemistry ? &quot; &quot; So by now , I had developed a new pedagogical method , so I applied that . I said , &quot; &quot; I haven &apos;t the foggiest idea . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; And anyway , I am going away . &quot; ( Laughter )
So I left them for a couple of months .
They &apos;d got a zero . I gave them a test .
I came back after two months and the children trooped in and said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve understood nothing . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what did I expect ? &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , but how long did it take you before you decided that you can &apos;t understand anything ? &quot; &quot; So they said , &quot; &quot; We haven &apos;t given up .
We look at it every single day . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; What ? You don &apos;t understand these screens and you keep staring at it for two months ? What for ? &quot; &quot; So a little girl who you see just now , she raised her hand , and she says to me in broken Tamil and English , she said , &quot; &quot; Well , apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule causes disease , we haven &apos;t understood anything else . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So I tested them .
I got an educational impossibility , zero to 30 percent in two months in the tropical heat with a computer under the tree in a language they didn &apos;t know doing something that &apos;s a decade ahead of their time .
Absurd . But I had to follow the Victorian norm .
Thirty percent is a fail .
How do I get them to pass ? I have to get them 20 more marks .
I couldn &apos;t find a teacher . What I did find was a friend that they had , a 22-year-old girl who was an accountant and she played with them all the time .
So I asked this girl , &quot; &quot; Can you help them ? &quot; &quot; So she says , &quot; &quot; Absolutely not .
I didn &apos;t have science in school . I have no idea what they &apos;re doing under that tree all day long . I can &apos;t help you . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll tell you what . Use the method of the grandmother . &quot; &quot; So she says , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s that ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Stand behind them .
Whenever they do anything , you just say , &apos; Well , wow , I mean , how did you do that ?
What &apos;s the next page ? Gosh , when I was your age , I could have never done that . &apos; You know what grannies do . &quot; &quot; So she did that for two more months .
The scores jumped to 50 percent .
Kallikuppam had caught up with my control school in New Delhi , a rich private school with a trained biotechnology teacher .
When I saw that graph I knew there is a way to level the playing field .
Here &apos;s Kallikuppam .
( Children speaking ) Neurons ... communication .
I got the camera angle wrong . That one is just amateur stuff , but what she was saying , as you could make out , was about neurons , with her hands were like that , and she was saying neurons communicate .
At 12 .
So what are jobs going to be like ?
Well , we know what they &apos;re like today .
What &apos;s learning going to be like ? We know what it &apos;s like today , children pouring over with their mobile phones on the one hand and then reluctantly going to school to pick up their books with their other hand .
What will it be tomorrow ?
Could it be that we don &apos;t need to go to school at all ?
Could it be that , at the point in time when you need to know something , you can find out in two minutes ?
Could it be — a devastating question , a question that was framed for me by Nicholas Negroponte — could it be that we are heading towards or maybe in a future where knowing is obsolete ?
But that &apos;s terrible . We are homo sapiens .
Knowing , that &apos;s what distinguishes us from the apes .
But look at it this way .
It took nature 100 million years to make the ape stand up and become Homo sapiens .
It took us only 10,000 to make knowing obsolete .
What an achievement that is .
But we have to integrate that into our own future .
Encouragement seems to be the key .
If you look at Kuppam , if you look at all of the experiments that I did , it was simply saying , &quot; &quot; Wow , &quot; &quot; saluting learning .
There is evidence from neuroscience .
The reptilian part of our brain , which sits in the center of our brain , when it &apos;s threatened , it shuts down everything else , it shuts down the prefrontal cortex , the parts which learn , it shuts all of that down .
Punishment and examinations are seen as threats .
We take our children , we make them shut their brains down , and then we say , &quot; &quot; Perform . &quot; &quot; Why did they create a system like that ?
Because it was needed .
There was an age in the Age of Empires when you needed those people who can survive under threat .
When you &apos;re standing in a trench all alone , if you could have survived , you &apos;re okay , you &apos;ve passed .
If you didn &apos;t , you failed .
But the Age of Empires is gone .
What happens to creativity in our age ?
We need to shift that balance back from threat to pleasure .
I came back to England looking for British grandmothers .
I put out notices in papers saying , if you are a British grandmother , if you have broadband and a web camera , can you give me one hour of your time per week for free ?
I got 200 in the first two weeks .
I know more British grandmothers than anyone in the universe . ( Laughter ) They &apos;re called the Granny Cloud .
The Granny Cloud sits on the Internet .
If there &apos;s a child in trouble , we beam a Gran .
She goes on over Skype and she sorts things out .
I &apos;ve seen them do it from a village called Diggles in northwestern England , deep inside a village in Tamil Nadu , India , 6,000 miles away .
She does it with only one age-old gesture .
&quot; Shhh . &quot;
Okay ?
Watch this .
Grandmother : You can &apos;t catch me . You say it . You can &apos;t catch me .
Children : You can &apos;t catch me . Grandmother : I &apos;m the Gingerbread Man.Children : I &apos;m the Gingerbread Man . Grandmother : Well done ! Very good . SM : So what &apos;s happening here ? I think what we need to look at is
we need to look at learning as the product of educational self-organization .
If you allow the educational process to self-organize , then learning emerges .
It &apos;s not about making learning happen .
It &apos;s about letting it happen .
The teacher sets the process in motion and then she stands back in awe and watches as learning happens .
I think that &apos;s what all this is pointing at .
But how will we know ? How will we come to know ?
Well , I intend to build these Self-Organized Learning Environments .
They are basically broadband , collaboration and encouragement put together .
I &apos;ve tried this in many , many schools .
It &apos;s been tried all over the world , and teachers sort of stand back and say , &quot; &quot; It just happens by itself ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , it happens by itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How did you know that ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You won &apos;t believe the children who told me and where they &apos;re from . &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s a SOLE in action .
( Children talking ) This one is in England .
He maintains law and order , because remember , there &apos;s no teacher around .
Girl : The total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons — SM : Australia Girl : — giving it a net positive or negative electrical charge .
The net charge on an ion is equal to the number of protons in the ion minus the number of electrons .
SM : A decade ahead of her time .
So SOLEs , I think we need a curriculum of big questions .
You already heard about that . You know what that means .
There was a time when Stone Age men and women used to sit and look up at the sky and say , &quot; What are those twinkling lights ? &quot;
They built the first curriculum , but we &apos;ve lost sight of those wondrous questions .
We &apos;ve brought it down to the tangent of an angle .
But that &apos;s not sexy enough .
The way you would put it to a nine-year-old is to say , &quot; &quot; If a meteorite was coming to hit the Earth , how would you figure out if it was going to or not ? &quot; &quot; And if he says , &quot; &quot; Well , what ? how ? &quot; &quot; you say , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a magic word . It &apos;s called the tangent of an angle , &quot; &quot; and leave him alone . He &apos;ll figure it out .
So here are a couple of images from SOLEs .
I &apos;ve tried incredible , incredible questions — &quot; &quot; When did the world begin ? How will it end ? &quot; &quot; — to nine-year-olds .
This one is about what happens to the air we breathe .
This is done by children without the help of any teacher .
The teacher only raises the question , and then stands back and admires the answer .
So what &apos;s my wish ?
My wish is that we design the future of learning .
We don &apos;t want to be spare parts for a great human computer , do we ?
So we need to design a future for learning .
And I &apos;ve got to — hang on , I &apos;ve got to get this wording exactly right , because , you know , it &apos;s very important .
My wish is to help design a future of learning by supporting children all over the world to tap into their wonder and their ability to work together .
Help me build this school .
It will be called the School in the Cloud .
It will be a school where children go on these intellectual adventures driven by the big questions which their mediators put in .
The way I want to do this is to build a facility where I can study this .
It &apos;s a facility which is practically unmanned .
There &apos;s only one granny who manages health and safety .
The rest of it &apos;s from the cloud .
The lights are turned on and off by the cloud , etc . , etc . , everything &apos;s done from the cloud .
But I want you for another purpose .
You can do Self-Organized Learning Environments at home , in the school , outside of school , in clubs .
It &apos;s very easy to do . There &apos;s a great document produced by TED which tells you how to do it .
If you would please , please do it across all five continents and send me the data , then I &apos;ll put it all together , move it into the School of Clouds , and create the future of learning .
That &apos;s my wish .
And just one last thing .
I &apos;ll take you to the top of the Himalayas .
At 12,000 feet , where the air is thin , I once built two Hole in the Wall computers , and the children flocked there .
And there was this little girl who was following me around .
And I said to her , &quot; &quot; You know , I want to give a computer to everybody , every child .
I don &apos;t know , what should I do ? &quot; &quot; And I was trying to take a picture of her quietly .
She suddenly raised her hand like this , and said to me , &quot; Get on with it . &quot;
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I think it was good advice .
I &apos;ll follow her advice . I &apos;ll stop talking .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . Wow . ( Applause )
Everything I do , and everything I do professionally — my life — has been shaped by seven years of work as a young man in Africa .
From 1971 to 1977 — I look young , but I &apos;m not — ( Laughter ) — I worked in Zambia , Kenya , Ivory Coast , Algeria , Somalia , in projects of technical cooperation with African countries .
I worked for an Italian NGO , and every single project that we set up in Africa failed .
And I was distraught .
I thought , age 21 , that we Italians were good people and we were doing good work in Africa .
Instead , everything we touched we killed .
Our first project , the one that has inspired my first book , &quot; Ripples from the Zambezi , &quot; was a project where we Italians decided to teach Zambian people how to grow food .
So we arrived there with Italian seeds in southern Zambia in this absolutely magnificent valley going down to the Zambezi River , and we taught the local people how to grow Italian tomatoes and zucchini and ...
And of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that , so we paid them to come and work , and sometimes they would show up . ( Laughter ) And we were amazed that the local people , in such a fertile valley , would not have any agriculture .
But instead of asking them how come they were not growing anything , we simply said , &quot; &quot; Thank God we &apos;re here . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; Just in the nick of time to save the Zambian people from starvation . &quot;
And of course , everything in Africa grew beautifully .
We had these magnificent tomatoes . In Italy , a tomato would grow to this size . In Zambia , to this size .
And we could not believe , and we were telling the Zambians , &quot; Look how easy agriculture is . &quot;
When the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red , overnight , some 200 hippos came out from the river and they ate everything . ( Laughter ) And we said to the Zambians , &quot; &quot; My God , the hippos ! &quot; &quot; And the Zambians said , &quot; &quot; Yes , that &apos;s why we have no agriculture here . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; Why didn &apos;t you tell us ? &quot; &quot; You never asked . &quot;
I thought it was only us Italians blundering around Africa , but then I saw what the Americans were doing , what the English were doing , what the French were doing , and after seeing what they were doing , I became quite proud of our project in Zambia .
Because , you see , at least we fed the hippos .
You should see the rubbish — ( Applause ) — You should see the rubbish that we have bestowed on unsuspecting African people .
You want to read the book , read &quot; &quot; Dead Aid , &quot; &quot; by Dambisa Moyo , Zambian woman economist .
The book was published in 2009 .
We Western donor countries have given the African continent two trillion American dollars in the last 50 years .
I &apos;m not going to tell you the damage that that money has done .
Just go and read her book .
Read it from an African woman , the damage that we have done .
We Western people are imperialist , colonialist missionaries , and there are only two ways we deal with people : We either patronize them , or we are paternalistic .
The two words come from the Latin root &quot; &quot; pater , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; father . &quot; &quot; But they mean two different things .
Paternalistic , I treat anybody from a different culture as if they were my children . &quot; &quot; I love you so much . &quot; &quot; Patronizing , I treat everybody from another culture as if they were my servants .
That &apos;s why the white people in Africa are called &quot; &quot; bwana , &quot; &quot; boss .
I was given a slap in the face reading a book , &quot; &quot; Small is Beautiful , &quot; &quot; written by Schumacher , who said , above all in economic development , if people do not wish to be helped , leave them alone .
This should be the first principle of aid .
The first principle of aid is respect .
This morning , the gentleman who opened this conference lay a stick on the floor , and said , &quot; &quot; Can we — can you imagine a city that is not neocolonial ? &quot; &quot; I decided when I was 27 years old to only respond to people , and I invented a system called Enterprise Facilitation , where you never initiate anything , you never motivate anybody , but you become a servant of the local passion , the servant of local people who have a dream to become a better person .
So what you do — you shut up .
You never arrive in a community with any ideas , and you sit with the local people .
We don &apos;t work from offices .
We meet at the cafe . We meet at the pub .
We have zero infrastructure .
And what we do , we become friends , and we find out what that person wants to do .
The most important thing is passion .
You can give somebody an idea .
If that person doesn &apos;t want to do it , what are you going to do ?
The passion that the person has for her own growth is the most important thing .
The passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing .
And then we help them to go and find the knowledge , because nobody in the world can succeed alone .
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge , but the knowledge is available .
So years and years ago , I had this idea : Why don &apos;t we , for once , instead of arriving in the community to tell people what to do , why don &apos;t , for once , listen to them ? But not in community meetings .
Let me tell you a secret .
There is a problem with community meetings .
Entrepreneurs never come , and they never tell you , in a public meeting , what they want to do with their own money , what opportunity they have identified .
So planning has this blind spot .
The smartest people in your community you don &apos;t even know , because they don &apos;t come to your public meetings .
What we do , we work one-on-one , and to work one-on-one , you have to create a social infrastructure that doesn &apos;t exist .
You have to create a new profession .
The profession is the family doctor of enterprise , the family doctor of business , who sits with you in your house , at your kitchen table , at the cafe , and helps you find the resources to transform your passion into a way to make a living .
I started this as a tryout in Esperance , in Western Australia .
I was a doing a Ph.D. at the time , trying to go away from this patronizing bullshit that we arrive and tell you what to do .
And so what I did in Esperance that first year was to just walk the streets , and in three days I had my first client , and I helped this first guy who was smoking fish from a garage , was a Maori guy , and I helped him to sell to the restaurant in Perth , to get organized , and then the fishermen came to me to say , &quot; You the guy who helped Maori ? Can you help us ? &quot;
And I helped these five fishermen to work together and get this beautiful tuna not to the cannery in Albany for 60 cents a kilo , but we found a way to take the fish for sushi to Japan for 15 dollars a kilo , and the farmers came to talk to me , said , &quot; Hey , you helped them . Can you help us ? &quot;
In a year , I had 27 projects going on , and the government came to see me to say , &quot; &quot; How can you do that ?
How can you do — ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I do something very , very , very difficult .
I shut up , and listen to them . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So — ( Applause ) — So the government says , &quot; &quot; Do it again . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We &apos;ve done it in 300 communities around the world .
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses .
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of solitude .
Peter Drucker , one of the greatest management consultants in history , died age 96 , a few years ago .
Peter Drucker was a professor of philosophy before becoming involved in business , and this is what Peter Drucker says : &quot; &quot; Planning is actually incompatible with an entrepreneurial society and economy . &quot; &quot; Planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship .
So now you &apos;re rebuilding Christchurch without knowing what the smartest people in Christchurch want to do with their own money and their own energy .
You have to learn how to get these people to come and talk to you .
You have to offer them confidentiality , privacy , you have to be fantastic at helping them , and then they will come , and they will come in droves .
In a community of 10,000 people , we get 200 clients .
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people , the intelligence and the passion ?
Which presentation have you applauded the most this morning ?
Local , passionate people . That &apos;s who you have applauded .
So what I &apos;m saying is that entrepreneurship is where it &apos;s at .
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution — nonrenewable fossil fuels , manufacturing — and all of a sudden , we have systems which are not sustainable .
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable .
Freon way of maintaining things is not sustainable .
What we have to look at is at how we feed , cure , educate , transport , communicate for seven billion people in a sustainable way .
The technologies do not exist to do that .
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution ? Universities ? Forget about it !
Government ? Forget about it !
It will be entrepreneurs , and they &apos;re doing it now .
There &apos;s a lovely story that I read in a futurist magazine many , many years ago .
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of the city of New York in 1860 .
And in 1860 , this group of people came together , and they all speculated about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years , and the conclusion was unanimous : The city of New York would not exist in 100 years .
Why ? Because they looked at the curve and said , if the population keeps growing at this rate , to move the population of New York around , they would have needed six million horses , and the manure created by six million horses would be impossible to deal with .
They were already drowning in manure . ( Laughter ) So 1860 , they are seeing this dirty technology that is going to choke the life out of New York .
So what happens ? In 40 years &apos; time , in the year 1900 , in the United States of America , there were 1,001 car manufacturing companies — 1,001 .
The idea of finding a different technology had absolutely taken over , and there were tiny , tiny little factories in backwaters .
Dearborn , Michigan . Henry Ford .
However , there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs .
First , you have to offer them confidentiality .
Otherwise they don &apos;t come and talk to you .
Then you have to offer them absolute , dedicated , passionate service to them .
And then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship .
The smallest company , the biggest company , has to be capable of doing three things beautifully : The product that you want to sell has to be fantastic , you have to have fantastic marketing , and you have to have tremendous financial management .
Guess what ?
We have never met a single human being in the world who can make it , sell it and look after the money .
It doesn &apos;t exist .
This person has never been born .
We &apos;ve done the research , and we have looked at the 100 iconic companies of the world — Carnegie , Westinghouse , Edison , Ford , all the new companies , Google , Yahoo .
There &apos;s only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common , only one : None were started by one person .
Now we teach entrepreneurship to 16-year-olds in Northumberland , and we start the class by giving them the first two pages of Richard Branson &apos;s autobiography , and the task of the 16-year-olds is to underline , in the first two pages of Richard Branson &apos;s autobiography how many times Richard uses the word &quot; &quot; I &quot; &quot; and how many times he uses the word &quot; &quot; we . &quot; &quot; Never the word &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; and the word &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; 32 times .
He wasn &apos;t alone when he started .
Nobody started a company alone . No one .
So we can create the community where we have facilitators who come from a small business background sitting in cafes , in bars , and your dedicated buddies who will do to you , what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this epic , somebody who will say to you , &quot; &quot; What do you need ?
What can you do ? Can you make it ?
Okay , can you sell it ? Can you look after the money ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , no , I cannot do this . &quot; &quot; Would you like me to find you somebody ? &quot;
We activate communities .
We have groups of volunteers supporting the Enterprise Facilitator to help you to find resources and people and we have discovered that the miracle of the intelligence of local people is such that you can change the culture and the economy of this community just by capturing the passion , the energy and imagination of your own people .
Thank you . ( Applause )
Do you think the world is going to be a better place next year ?
In the next decade ?
Can we end hunger , achieve gender equality , halt climate change , all in the next 15 years ?
Well , according to the governments of the world , yes we can .
In the last few days , the leaders of the world , meeting at the UN in New York , agreed a new set of Global Goals for the development of the world to 2030 .
And here they are : these goals are the product of a massive consultation exercise .
The Global Goals are who we , humanity , want to be .
Now that &apos;s the plan , but can we get there ?
Can this vision for a better world really be achieved ?
Well , I &apos;m here today because we &apos;ve run the numbers , and the answer , shockingly , is that maybe we actually can .
But not with business as usual .
Now , the idea that the world is going to get a better place may seem a little fanciful .
Watch the news every day and the world seems to be going backwards , not forwards .
And let &apos;s be frank : it &apos;s pretty easy to be skeptical about grand announcements coming out of the UN .
But please , I invite you to suspend your disbelief for just a moment .
The target was to take from a baseline of 1990 , when 36 percent of the world &apos;s population lived in poverty , to get to 18 percent poverty this year .
Did we hit this target ?
Well , no , we didn &apos;t .
We exceeded it .
This year , global poverty is going to fall to 12 percent .
Now , that &apos;s still not good enough , and the world does still have plenty of problems .
So how did we achieve this success ?
Well , a lot of it was because of economic growth .
Some of the biggest reductions in poverty were in countries such as China and India , which have seen rapid economic growth in recent years .
So can we pull off the same trick again ?
Can economic growth get us to the Global Goals ?
Well , to answer that question , we need to benchmark where the world is today against the Global Goals and figure out how far we have to travel .
Over 17 goals , there are then 169 targets and literally hundreds of indicators .
Also , while some of the goals are pretty specific — end hunger — others are a lot vaguer — promote peaceful and tolerant societies .
So to help us with this benchmarking , I &apos;m going to use a tool called the Social Progress Index .
What this does is measures all the stuff the Global Goals are trying to achieve , but sums it up into a single number that we can use as our benchmark and track progress over time .
First of all , does everyone have the basic needs of survival : food , water , shelter , safety ?
Secondly , does everyone have the building blocks of a better life : education , information , health and a sustainable environment ?
And does everyone have the opportunity to improve their lives , through rights , freedom of choice , freedom from discrimination , and access to the world &apos;s most advanced knowledge ?
The Social Progress Index sums all this together using 52 indicators to create an aggregate score on a scale of 0 to 100 .
And what we find is that there &apos;s a wide diversity of performance in the world today .
The highest performing country , Norway , scores 88 .
The lowest performing country , Central African Republic , scores 31 .
And we can add up all the countries together , weighting for the different population sizes , and that global score is 61 .
In concrete terms , that means that the average human being is living on a level of social progress about the same of Cuba or Kazakhstan today .
That &apos;s where we are today : 61 out of 100 .
What do we have to get to to achieve the Global Goals ?
Now , the Global Goals are certainly ambitious , but they &apos;re not about turning the world into Norway in just 15 years .
So having looked at the numbers , my estimate is that a score of 75 would not only be a giant leap forward in human well-being , it would also count as hitting the Global Goals target .
So there &apos;s our target , 75 out of 100 .
Can we get there ?
Well , the Social Progress Index can help us calculate this , because as you might have noticed , there are no economic indicators in there ; there &apos;s no GDP or economic growth in the Social Progress Index model .
And what that lets us do is understand the relationship between economic growth and social progress .
Let me show you on this chart .
So here on the vertical axis , I &apos;ve put social progress , the stuff the Global Goals are trying to achieve .
Higher is better .
And then on the horizontal axis , is GDP per capita .
Further to the right means richer .
And in there , I &apos;m now going to put all the countries of the world , each one represented by a dot , and on top of that I &apos;m going to put the regression line that shows the average relationship .
And what this tells us is that as we get richer , social progress does tend to improve .
However , as we get richer , each extra dollar of GDP is buying us less and less social progress .
And now we can use this information to start building our forecast .
So here is the world in 2015 .
We have a social progress score of 61 and a GDP per capita of $ 14,000 .
And the place we &apos;re trying to get to , remember , is 75 , that Global Goals target .
So here we are today , $ 14,000 per capita GDP .
How rich are we going to be in 2030 ?
That &apos;s what we need to know next .
Well , the best forecast we can find comes from the US Department of Agriculture , which forecasts 3.1 percent average global economic growth over the next 15 years , which means that in 2030 , if they &apos;re right , per capita GDP will be about $ 23,000 .
So now the question is : if we get that much richer , how much social progress are we going to get ?
Well , we asked a team of economists at Deloitte who checked and crunched the numbers , and they came back and said , well , look : if the world &apos;s average wealth goes from $ 14,000 a year to $ 23,000 a year , social progress is going to increase from 61 to 62.4 .
( Laughter ) Just 62.4 . Just a tiny increase .
So what &apos;s going on ?
Well , I think there are two things .
The first is that in a way , we &apos;re the victims of our own success .
We &apos;ve used up the easy wins from economic growth , and now we &apos;re moving on to harder problems .
And also , we know that economic growth comes with costs as well as benefits .
There are costs to the environment , costs from new health problems like obesity .
So that &apos;s the bad news .
We &apos;re not going to get to the Global Goals just by getting richer .
So are the pessimists right ?
Well , maybe not .
Because the Social Progress Index also has some very good news .
Let me take you back to that regression line .
So this is the average relationship between GDP and social progress , and this is what our last forecast was based on .
But as you saw already , there is actually lots of noise around this trend line .
What that tells us , quite simply , is that GDP is not destiny .
We have countries that are underperforming on social progress , relative to their wealth .
Russia has lots of natural resource wealth , but lots of social problems .
China has boomed economically , but hasn &apos;t made much headway on human rights or environmental issues .
India has a space program and millions of people without toilets .
Now , on the other hand , we have countries that are overperforming on social progress relative to their GDP .
Costa Rica has prioritized education , health and environmental sustainability , and as a result , it &apos;s achieving a very high level of social progress , despite only having a rather modest GDP .
And Costa Rica &apos;s not alone .
From poor countries like Rwanda to richer countries like New Zealand , we see that it &apos;s possible to get lots of social progress , even if your GDP is not so great .
And that &apos;s really important , because it tells us two things .
First of all , it tells us that we already in the world have the solutions to many of the problems that the Global Goals are trying to solve .
It also tells us that we &apos;re not slaves to GDP .
Our choices matter : if we prioritize the well-being of people , then we can make a lot more progress than our GDP might expect .
How much ? Enough to get us to the Global Goals ?
Well , let &apos;s look at some numbers .
What we know already : the world today is scoring 61 on social progress , and the place we want to get to is 75 .
If we rely on economic growth alone , we &apos;re going to get to 62.4 .
So let &apos;s assume now that we can get the countries that are currently underperforming on social progress — the Russia , China , Indias — just up to the average .
How much social progress does that get us ?
So let &apos;s get a little bit more optimistic and say , what if every country gets a little bit better at turning its wealth into well-being ?
Well then , we get to 67 .
And now let &apos;s be even bolder still .
What if every country in the world chose to be like Costa Rica in prioritizing human well-being , using its wealth for the well-being of its citizens ?
Well then , we get to nearly 73 , very close to the Global Goals .
Can we achieve the Global Goals ?
Certainly not with business as usual .
Even a flood tide of economic growth is not going to get us there , if it just raises the mega-yachts and the super-wealthy and leaves the rest behind .
If we &apos;re going to achieve the Global Goals we have to do things differently .
We have to prioritize social progress , and really scale solutions around the world .
I believe the Global Goals are a historic opportunity , because the world &apos;s leaders have promised to deliver them .
Let &apos;s not dismiss the goals or slide into pessimism ; let &apos;s hold them to that promise .
And we need to hold them to that promise by holding them accountable , tracking their progress all the way through the next 15 years .
And I want to finish by showing you a way to do that , called the People &apos;s Report Card .
The People &apos;s Report Card brings together all this data into a simple framework that we &apos;ll all be familiar with from our school days , to hold them to account .
It grades our performance on the Global Goals on a scale from F to A , where F is humanity at its worst , and A is humanity at its best .
Our world today is scoring a C- .
The Global Goals are all about getting to an A , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re going to be updating the People &apos;s Report Card annually , for the world and for all the countries of the world , so we can hold our leaders to account to achieve this target and fulfill this promise .
Because getting to the Global Goals will only happen if we do things differently , if our leaders do things differently , and for that to happen , that needs us to demand it .
So let &apos;s reject business as usual .
Let &apos;s demand a different path .
Let &apos;s choose the world that we want .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Bruno Giussani : Thank you , Michael .
Michael , just one question : the Millennium Development Goals established 15 years ago , they were kind of applying to every country but it turned out to be really a scorecard for emerging countries .
Now the new Global Goals are explicitly universal .
They ask for every country to show action and to show progress .
How can I , as a private citizen , use the report card to create pressure for action ?
Michael Green : This is a really important point ; it &apos;s a big shift in priorities — it &apos;s no longer about poor countries and just poverty .
It &apos;s about every country .
And every country is going to have challenges in getting to the Global Goals .
Even , I &apos;m sorry to say , Bruno , Switzerland has got to work to do .
And so that &apos;s why we &apos;re going to produce these report cards in 2016 for every country in the world .
Then we can really see , how are we doing ?
And it &apos;s not going to be rich countries scoring straight A &apos;s .
And that , then , I think , is to provide a point of focus for people to start demanding action and start demanding progress .
BG : Thank you very much .

Unless we do something to prevent it , over the next 40 years we ’ re facing an epidemic of neurologic diseases on a global scale .
A cheery thought .
On this map , every country that ’ s colored blue has more than 20 percent of its population over the age of 65 .
This is the world we live in .
And this is the world your children will live in .
For 12,000 years , the distribution of ages in the human population has looked like a pyramid , with the oldest on top .
It ’ s already flattening out .
By 2050 , it ’ s going to be a column and will start to invert .
This is why it ’ s happening .
The average lifespan ’ s more than doubled since 1840 , and it ’ s increasing currently at the rate of about five hours every day .
And this is why that ’ s not entirely a good thing : because over the age of 65 , your risk of getting Alzheimer ’ s or Parkinson ’ s disease will increase exponentially .
By 2050 , there ’ ll be about 32 million people in the United States over the age of 80 , and unless we do something about it , half of them will have Alzheimer ’ s disease and three million more will have Parkinson ’ s disease .
Right now , those and other neurologic diseases — for which we have no cure or prevention — cost about a third of a trillion dollars a year .
It will be well over a trillion dollars by 2050 .
Alzheimer ’ s disease starts when a protein that should be folded up properly misfolds into a kind of demented origami .
So one approach we ’ re taking is to try to design drugs that function like molecular Scotch tape , to hold the protein into its proper shape .
That would keep it from forming the tangles that seem to kill large sections of the brain when they do .
Interestingly enough , other neurologic diseases which affect very different parts of the brain also show tangles of misfolded protein , which suggests that the approach might be a general one , and might be used to cure many neurologic diseases , not just Alzheimer ’ s disease .
There ’ s also a fascinating connection to cancer here , because people with neurologic diseases have a very low incidence of most cancers .
And this is a connection that most people aren ’ t pursuing right now , but which we ’ re fascinated by .
Most of the important and all of the creative work in this area is being funded by private philanthropies .
And there ’ s tremendous scope for additional private help here , because the government has dropped the ball on much of this , I ’ m afraid .
In the meantime , while we ’ re waiting for all these things to happen , here ’ s what you can do for yourself .
If you want to lower your risk of Parkinson ’ s disease , caffeine is protective to some extent ; nobody knows why .
Head injuries are bad for you . They lead to Parkinson ’ s disease .
And the Avian Flu is also not a good idea .
As far as protecting yourself against Alzheimer ’ s disease , well , it turns out that fish oil has the effect of reducing your risk for Alzheimer ’ s disease .
You should also keep your blood pressure down , because chronic high blood pressure is the biggest single risk factor for Alzheimer ’ s disease .
It ’ s also the biggest risk factor for glaucoma , which is just Alzheimer ’ s disease of the eye .
And of course , when it comes to cognitive effects , &quot; &quot; use it or lose it &quot; &quot; applies , so you want to stay mentally stimulated .
But hey , you ’ re listening to me .
So you ’ ve got that covered .
And one final thing . Wish people like me luck , okay ?
Because the clock is ticking for all of us .
Thank you .
You know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before — about the human genome and what that might mean , and discovering new sets of genes .
We &apos;re actually starting at a new point : we &apos;ve been digitizing biology , and now we &apos;re trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life .
So , we &apos;ve always been trying to ask big questions .
&quot; &quot; What is life ? &quot; &quot; is something that I think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels .
We &apos;ve tried various approaches , paring it down to minimal components .
We &apos;ve been digitizing it now for almost 20 years ; when we sequenced the human genome , it was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer .
Now we &apos;re trying to ask , &quot; &quot; Can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? &quot; &quot; This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , that has the smallest genome for a species that can self-replicate in the laboratory , and we &apos;ve been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome .
We &apos;re able to knock out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here .
When we look at its metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple compared to ours — trust me , this is simple — but when we look at all the genes that we can knock out one at a time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would yield a living cell .
So we decided the only way forward was to actually synthesize this chromosome so we could vary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions .
And so we started down the road of : can we synthesize a chromosome ?
Can chemistry permit making these really large molecules where we &apos;ve never been before ?
And if we do , can we boot up a chromosome ?
A chromosome , by the way , is just a piece of inert chemical material .
So , our pace of digitizing life has been increasing at an exponential pace .
Our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing , and our latest point would put it on , now , an exponential curve .
We started this over 15 years ago .
It took several stages , in fact , starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
But it turns out synthesizing DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of DNA — 30 to 50 letters in length — and it &apos;s a degenerate process , so the longer you make the piece , the more errors there are .
So we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors .
And this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information of the genome of phi X174 .
It &apos;s a small virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the pieces , went through our error correction and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical and put it in the bacteria , and the bacteria started to read this genetic code , made the viral particles .
The viral particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the E. coli .
I was talking to the oil industry recently and I said they clearly understood that model .
( Laughter ) They laughed more than you guys are . ( Laughter ) And so , we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to go much larger : we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome — it &apos;s over 580,000 letters of genetic code — so we thought we &apos;d build them in cassettes the size of the viruses so we could actually vary the cassettes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are .
Design is critical , and if you &apos;re starting with digital information in the computer , that digital information has to be really accurate .
When we first sequenced this genome in 1995 , the standard of accuracy was one error per 10,000 base pairs .
We actually found , on resequencing it , 30 errors ; had we used that original sequence , it never would have been able to be booted up .
Part of the design is designing pieces that are 50 letters long that have to overlap with all the other 50-letter pieces to build smaller subunits we have to design so they can go together .
We design unique elements into this .
You may have read that we put watermarks in .
Think of this : we have a four-letter genetic code — A , C , G and T.
Triplets of those letters code for roughly 20 amino acids , such that there &apos;s a single letter designation for each of the amino acids .
So we can use the genetic code to write out words , sentences , thoughts .
Initially , all we did was autograph it .
Some people were disappointed there was not poetry .
We designed these pieces so we can just chew back with enzymes ; there are enzymes that repair them and put them together .
And we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters , put those together to make 24,000-letter pieces , then put sets of those going up to 72,000 .
At each stage , we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we &apos;re trying to create a process that &apos;s extremely robust that you can see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to get to the point of automation .
So , this looks like a basketball playoff .
When we get into these really large pieces over 100,000 base pairs , they won &apos;t any longer grow readily in E. coli — it exhausts all the modern tools of molecular biology — and so we turned to other mechanisms .
We knew there &apos;s a mechanism called homologous recombination that biology uses to repair DNA that can put pieces together .
Here &apos;s an example of it : there &apos;s an organism called Deinococcus radiodurans that can take three millions rads of radiation .
You can see in the top panel , its chromosome just gets blown apart .
Twelve to 24 hours later , it put it back together exactly as it was before .
We have thousands of organisms that can do this .
These organisms can be totally desiccated ; they can live in a vacuum .
I am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space , move around , find a new aqueous environment .
In fact , NASA has shown a lot of this is out there .
Here &apos;s an actual micrograph of the molecule we built using these processes , actually just using yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we put them in ; yeast puts them together automatically .
This is not an electron micrograph ; this is just a regular photomicrograph .
It &apos;s such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscope .
These are pictures over about a six-second period .
So , this is the publication we had just a short while ago .
This is over 580,000 letters of genetic code ; it &apos;s the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure .
It &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight .
If we printed it out at a 10 font with no spacing , it takes 142 pages just to print this genetic code .
Well , how do we boot up a chromosome ? How do we activate this ?
Obviously , with a virus it &apos;s pretty simple ; it &apos;s much more complicated dealing with bacteria .
It &apos;s also simpler when you go into eukaryotes like ourselves : you can just pop out the nucleus and pop in another one , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all heard about with cloning .
With bacteria and Archaea , the chromosome is integrated into the cell , but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it .
We purified a chromosome from one microbial species — roughly , these two are as distant as human and mice — we added a few extra genes so we could select for this chromosome , we digested it with enzymes to kill all the proteins , and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell — and you &apos;ll appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here .
The new chromosome went into the cell .
In fact , we thought this might be as far as it went , but we tried to design the process a little bit further .
This is a major mechanism of evolution right here .
We find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromosome or a third one from somewhere , adding thousands of new traits in a second to that species .
So , people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have missed much of biology .
There are enzymes called restriction enzymes that actually digest DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell doesn &apos;t have one ; the chromosome we put in does .
It got expressed and it recognized the other chromosome as foreign material , chewed it up , and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromosome .
It turned blue because of the genes we put in it .
And with a very short period of time , all the characteristics of one species were lost and it converted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All the proteins changed , the membranes changed ; when we read the genetic code , it &apos;s exactly what we had transferred in .
So , this may sound like genomic alchemy , but we can , by moving the software of DNA around , change things quite dramatically .
Now I &apos;ve argued , this is not genesis ; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution .
And I &apos;ve argued that we &apos;re about to perhaps create a new version of the Cambrian explosion , where there &apos;s massive new speciation based on this digital design .
Why do this ?
I think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs .
We &apos;re about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years .
To put it in context for myself : I was born in 1946 .
There are now three people on the planet for every one of us that existed in 1946 ; within 40 years , there &apos;ll be four .
We have trouble feeding , providing fresh , clean water , medicines , fuel for the six and a half billion .
It &apos;s going to be a stretch to do it for nine .
We use over five billion tons of coal , 30 billion-plus barrels of oil — that &apos;s a hundred million barrels a day .
When we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
Then of course , there &apos;s all that CO2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere .
We now , from our discovery around the world , have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think of these as the design components of the future .
The electronics industry only had a dozen or so components , and look at the diversity that came out of that .
We &apos;re limited here primarily by a biological reality and our imagination .
We now have techniques , because of these rapid methods of synthesis , to do what we &apos;re calling combinatorial genomics .
We have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromosomes a day .
When you think of processing these 20 million different genes or trying to optimize processes to produce octane or to produce pharmaceuticals , new vaccines , we can just with a small team , do more molecular biology than the last 20 years of all science .
And it &apos;s just standard selection : we can select for viability , chemical or fuel production , vaccine production , etc .
This is a screen snapshot of some true design software that we &apos;re working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer .
You know , we don &apos;t know necessarily what it &apos;ll look like : we know exactly what their genetic code looks like .
We &apos;re focusing on now fourth-generation fuels .
You &apos;ve seen recently , corn to ethanol is just a bad experiment .
We have second- and third-generation fuels that will be coming out relatively soon that are sugar , to much higher-value fuels like octane or different types of butanol .
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and limiting its availability is if we start with CO2 as its feedstock , and so we &apos;re working with designing cells to go down this road .
And we think we &apos;ll have the first fourth-generation fuels in about 18 months .
Sunlight and CO2 is one method ...
( Applause ) but in our discovery around the world , we have all kinds of other methods .
This is an organism we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about a mile and a half deep , almost at boiling-water temperatures .
It takes CO2 to methane using molecular hydrogen as its energy source .
We &apos;re looking to see if we can take captured CO2 , which can easily be piped to sites , convert that CO2 back into fuel to drive this process .
So , in a short period of time , we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of &quot; &quot; What is life ? &quot; &quot; We truly , you know , have modest goals of replacing the whole petrol-chemical industry — ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Yeah . If you can &apos;t do that at TED , where can you ? — ( Laughter ) become a major source of energy ...
But also , we &apos;re now working on using these same tools to come up with instant sets of vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with flu ; we &apos;re always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vaccine .
I think that can be changed by building combinatorial vaccines in advance .
Here &apos;s what the future may begin to look like with changing , now , the evolutionary tree , speeding up evolution with synthetic bacteria , Archaea and , eventually , eukaryotes .
We &apos;re a ways away from improving people : our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that . Thank you very much .

I write about food . I write about cooking .
I take it quite seriously , but I &apos;m here to talk about something that &apos;s become very important to me in the last year or two .
I &apos;m going to start with this picture of a beautiful cow .
I &apos;m not a vegetarian — this is the old Nixon line , right ?
Now , that is only a little bit hyperbolic .
And why do I say it ?
And where we go from here is going to determine not only the quality and the length of our individual lives , but whether , if we could see the Earth a century from now , we &apos;d recognize it .
It &apos;s a holocaust of a different kind , and hiding under our desks isn &apos;t going to help .
Start with the notion that global warming is not only real , but dangerous .
Since every scientist in the world now believes this , and even President Bush has seen the light , or pretends to , we can take this is a given .
Then hear this , please .
After energy production , livestock is the second-highest contributor to atmosphere-altering gases .
Nearly one-fifth of all greenhouse gas is generated by livestock production — more than transportation .
Livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation , air and water pollution , water shortages and loss of biodiversity .
There &apos;s more .
Like half the antibiotics in this country are not administered to people , but to animals .
But lists like this become kind of numbing , so let me just say this : if you &apos;re a progressive , if you &apos;re driving a Prius , or you &apos;re shopping green , or you &apos;re looking for organic , you should probably be a semi-vegetarian .
Now , I &apos;m no more anti-cattle than I am anti-atom , but it &apos;s all in the way we use these things .
There &apos;s no question , none , that so-called lifestyle diseases — diabetes , heart disease , stroke , some cancers — are diseases that are far more prevalent here than anywhere in the rest of the world .
And that &apos;s the direct result of eating a Western diet .
Our demand for meat , dairy and refined carbohydrates — the world consumes one billion cans or bottles of Coke a day — our demand for these things , not our need , our want , drives us to consume way more calories than are good for us .
And those calories are in foods that cause , not prevent , disease .
Now global warming was unforeseen .
Maybe a few lung diseases here and there , but , you know , that &apos;s not such a big deal .
The current health crisis , however , is a little more the work of the evil empire .
We were told , we were assured , that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate , the healthier we &apos;d be .
No . Overconsumption of animals , and of course , junk food , is the problem , along with our paltry consumption of plants .
Now , there &apos;s no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here , but the evidence is that plants — and I want to make this clear — it &apos;s not the ingredients in plants , it &apos;s the plants .
It &apos;s not the beta-carotene , it &apos;s the carrot .
The evidence is very clear that plants promote health .
This evidence is overwhelming at this point .
You eat more plants , you eat less other stuff , you live longer .
Not bad .
But back to animals and junk food .
We don &apos;t need animal products , and we certainly don &apos;t need white bread or Coke .
Two : both have been marketed heavily , creating unnatural demand .
We &apos;re not born craving Whoppers or Skittles .
Three : their production has been supported by government agencies at the expense of a more health- and Earth-friendly diet .
Now , let &apos;s imagine a parallel .
Let &apos;s pretend that our government supported an oil-based economy , while discouraging more sustainable forms of energy , knowing all the while that the result would be pollution , war and rising costs .
Incredible , isn &apos;t it ?
Yet they do that .
And they do this here . It &apos;s the same deal .
The sad thing is , when it comes to diet , is that even when well-intentioned Feds try to do right by us , they fail .
Either they &apos;re outvoted by puppets of agribusiness , or they are puppets of agribusiness .
So , when the USDA finally acknowledged that it was plants , rather than animals , that made people healthy , they encouraged us , via their overly simplistic food pyramid , to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day , along with more carbs .
What they didn &apos;t tell us is that some carbs are better than others , and that plants and whole grains should be supplanting eating junk food .
But industry lobbyists would never let that happen .
And guess what ?
Half the people who developed the food pyramid have ties to agribusiness .
So , instead of substituting plants for animals , our swollen appetites simply became larger , and the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged .
So-called low-fat diets , so-called low-carb diets — these are not solutions .
But with lots of intelligent people focusing on whether food is organic or local , or whether we &apos;re being nice to animals , the most important issues just aren &apos;t being addressed .
Now , don &apos;t get me wrong .
I like animals , and I don &apos;t think it &apos;s just fine to industrialize their production and to churn them out like they were wrenches .
But there &apos;s no way to treat animals well , when you &apos;re killing 10 billion of them a year .
That &apos;s our number . 10 billion .
If you strung all of them — chickens , cows , pigs and lambs — to the moon , they &apos;d go there and back five times , there and back .
Now , my math &apos;s a little shaky , but this is pretty good , and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long , but you get the idea .
That &apos;s just the United States .
And with our hyper-consumption of those animals producing greenhouse gases and heart disease , kindness might just be a bit of a red herring .
Let &apos;s get the numbers of the animals we &apos;re killing for eating down , and then we &apos;ll worry about being nice to the ones that are left .
Another red herring might be exemplified by the word &quot; &quot; locavore , &quot; &quot; which was just named word of the year by the New Oxford American Dictionary .
Between the official story — the food pyramid — and the hip locavore vision , you have two versions of how to improve our eating .
They both get it wrong , though .
The first at least is populist , and the second is elitist .
How we got to this place is the history of food in the United States .
And I &apos;m going to go through that , at least the last hundred years or so , very quickly right now .
A hundred years ago , guess what ?
Everyone was a locavore : even New York had pig farms nearby , and shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion .
Every family had a cook , usually a mom .
And those moms bought and prepared food .
It was like your romantic vision of Europe .
There was no snack food , and until the &apos; 20s , until Clarence Birdseye came along , there was no frozen food .
There were no restaurant chains .
There were neighborhood restaurants run by local people , but none of them would think to open another one .
Eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic .
And fancy food was entirely French .
As an aside , those of you who remember Dan Aykroyd in the 1970s doing Julia Child imitations can see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide .
( Laughter ) Back in those days , before even Julia , back in those days , there was no philosophy of food .
You didn &apos;t claim to be anything .
There was no marketing . There were no national brands .
Vitamins had not been invented .
There were no health claims , at least not federally sanctioned ones .
Fats , carbs , proteins — they weren &apos;t bad or good , they were food .
You ate food .
Hardly anything contained more than one ingredient , because it was an ingredient .
The cornflake hadn &apos;t been invented .
From the &apos; 30s on , road systems expanded , trucks took the place of railroads , fresh food began to travel more .
Oranges became common in New York .
The South and West became agricultural hubs , and in other parts of the country , suburbs took over farmland .
Eventually , California produced too much food to ship fresh , so it became critical to market canned and frozen foods .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) If we had a slide of Salisbury steak , even more so , right ? ( Laughter )
But this may have cut down on housework , but it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well .
Many of us grew up never eating a fresh vegetable except the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad .
I , for one — and I &apos;m not kidding — didn &apos;t eat real spinach or broccoli till I was 19 .
Who needed it though ? Meat was everywhere .
What could be easier , more filling or healthier for your family than broiling a steak ?
But by then cattle were already raised unnaturally .
Rather than spending their lives eating grass , for which their stomachs were designed , they were forced to eat soy and corn .
New drugs kept them healthy .
Well , they kept them alive .
Healthy was another story .
Thanks to farm subsidies , the fine collaboration between agribusiness and Congress , soy , corn and cattle became king .
It was during this period that the cycle of dietary and planetary destruction began , the thing we &apos;re only realizing just now .
Meat consumption increased five-fold .
Now , someone had to eat all that stuff , so we got fast food .
And this took care of the situation resoundingly .
Home cooking remained the norm , but its quality was down the tubes .
There were fewer meals with home-cooked breads , desserts and soups , because all of them could be bought at any store .
Not that they were any good , but they were there .
Most moms cooked like mine : a piece of broiled meat , a quickly made salad with bottled dressing , canned soup , canned fruit salad .
Maybe baked or mashed potatoes , or perhaps the stupidest food ever , Minute Rice .
For dessert , store-bought ice cream or cookies .
My mom is not here , so I can say this now .
This kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself .
( Laughter ) It wasn &apos;t all bad .
By the &apos; 70s , forward-thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients .
We tended gardens , we became interested in organic food , we knew or we were vegetarians .
We weren &apos;t all hippies , either .
Some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well .
Meanwhile , food production had become industrial . Industrial .
Perhaps because it was being produced rationally , as if it were plastic , food gained magical or poisonous powers , or both .
Many people became fat-phobic .
Others worshiped broccoli , as if it were God-like .
But mostly they didn &apos;t eat broccoli .
Instead they were sold on yogurt , yogurt being almost as good as broccoli .
Except , in reality , the way the industry sold yogurt was to convert it to something much more akin to ice cream .
Similarly , let &apos;s look at a granola bar .
Sadly , it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma , if not actually killed — the beginning of the heyday of value-added food , which contained as many soy and corn products as could be crammed into it .
Think of the frozen chicken nugget .
The chicken is fed corn , and then its meat is ground up , and mixed with more corn products to add bulk and binder , and then it &apos;s fried in corn oil .
All you do is nuke it . What could be better ?
And zapped horribly , pathetically .
By the &apos; 70s , home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like McNuggets and Hot Pockets — and we all have our favorites , actually — made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home .
At the same time , masses of women were entering the workforce , and cooking simply wasn &apos;t important enough for men to share the burden .
So now , you &apos;ve got your pizza nights , you &apos;ve got your microwave nights , you &apos;ve got your grazing nights , you &apos;ve got your fend-for-yourself nights and so on .
Leading the way — what &apos;s leading the way ?
Meat , junk food , cheese : the very stuff that will kill you .
So , now we clamor for organic food .
That &apos;s good .
And as evidence that things can actually change , you can now find organic food in supermarkets , and even in fast-food outlets .
But organic food isn &apos;t the answer either , at least not the way it &apos;s currently defined .
Let me pose you a question .
Can farm-raised salmon be organic , when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet , even if the feed itself is supposedly organic , and the fish themselves are packed tightly in pens , swimming in their own filth ?
And if that salmon &apos;s from Chile , and it &apos;s killed down there and then flown 5,000 miles , whatever , dumping how much carbon into the atmosphere ?
I don &apos;t know .
Packed in Styrofoam , of course , before landing somewhere in the United States , and then being trucked a few hundred more miles .
This may be organic in letter , but it &apos;s surely not organic in spirit .
Now here is where we all meet .
The locavores , the organivores , the vegetarians , the vegans , the gourmets and those of us who are just plain interested in good food .
We need to start acting .
And this is not only an issue of social justice , as Ann Cooper said — and , of course , she &apos;s completely right — but it &apos;s also one of global survival .
Which bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue , the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food .
As I said , 18 percent of greenhouse gases are attributed to livestock production .
How much livestock do you need to produce this ?
70 percent of the agricultural land on Earth , 30 percent of the Earth &apos;s land surface is directly or indirectly devoted to raising the animals we &apos;ll eat .
And this amount is predicted to double in the next 40 years or so .
And if the numbers coming in from China are anything like what they look like now , it &apos;s not going to be 40 years .
There is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do .
And I say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life .
But listen : experts who are serious about disease reduction recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week .
What do you think we eat per day ? Half a pound .
But don &apos;t we need meat to be big and strong ?
Isn &apos;t meat eating essential to health ?
Won &apos;t a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables turn us into godless , sissy , liberals ?
( Laughter ) Some of us might think that would be a good thing .
But , no , even if we were all steroid-filled football players , the answer is no .
In fact , there &apos;s no diet on Earth that meets basic nutritional needs that won &apos;t promote growth , and many will make you much healthier than ours does .
To suggest that in the interests of personal and human health Americans eat 50 percent less meat — it &apos;s not enough of a cut , but it &apos;s a start .
It would seem absurd , but that &apos;s exactly what should happen , and what progressive people , forward-thinking people should be doing and advocating , along with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants .
I &apos;ve been writing about food more or less omnivorously — one might say indiscriminately — for about 30 years .
I &apos;ll never stop eating animals , I &apos;m sure , but I do think that for the benefit of everyone , the time has come to stop raising them industrially and stop eating them thoughtlessly .
Ann Cooper &apos;s right .
The USDA is not our ally here .
And that happens to be quite easy .
Less meat , less junk , more plants .
It &apos;s a simple formula : eat food .
Eat real food .
We can continue to enjoy our food , and we continue to eat well , and we can eat even better .
We can continue the search for the ingredients we love , and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals .
We &apos;ll reduce not only calories , but our carbon footprint .
We can make food more important , not less , and save ourselves by doing so .
Hello .
It was consistent .
So I would need a piano to practice on , and an hour later I would be at a fan &apos;s house .
This is a library in Auckland .
We sign with a major label .
I become the hat after my own gigs , but I have to physically stand there and take the help from people , and unlike the guy in the opening band , I &apos;ve actually had a lot of practice standing there .
So I fought my way off my label , and for my next project with my new band , the Grand Theft Orchestra , I turned to crowdfunding .
And I fell into those thousands of connections that I &apos;d made , and I asked my crowd to catch me .
( Applause ) And you can see how many people it is .
And a lot of artists have a problem with this .
It &apos;s about a few people loving you up close and about those people being enough .
In the northwest corner of the United States , right up near the Canadian border , there &apos;s a little town called Libby , Montana , and it &apos;s surrounded by pine trees and lakes and just amazing wildlife and these enormous trees that scream up into the sky .
And in there is a little town called Libby , which I visited , which feels kind of lonely , a little isolated .
And in Libby , Montana , there &apos;s a rather unusual woman named Gayla Benefield .
She always felt a little bit of an outsider , although she &apos;s been there almost all her life , a woman of Russian extraction .
Later in life , she got a job going house to house reading utility meters — gas meters , electricity meters .
And she was doing the work in the middle of the day , and one thing particularly caught her notice , which was , in the middle of the day she met a lot of men who were at home , middle aged , late middle aged , and a lot of them seemed to be on oxygen tanks .
It struck her as strange .
Then , a few years later , her father died at the age of 59 , five days before he was due to receive his pension .
He &apos;d been a miner .
She thought he must just have been worn out by the work .
But then a few years later , her mother died , and that seemed stranger still , because her mother came from a long line of people who just seemed to live forever .
In fact , Gayla &apos;s uncle is still alive to this day , and learning how to waltz .
It didn &apos;t make sense that Gayla &apos;s mother should die so young .
It was an anomaly , and she kept puzzling over anomalies .
And as she did , other ones came to mind .
She remembered , for example , when her mother had broken a leg and went into the hospital , and she had a lot of x-rays , and two of them were leg x-rays , which made sense , but six of them were chest x-rays , which didn &apos;t .
She puzzled and puzzled over every piece of her life and her parents &apos; life , trying to understand what she was seeing .
She thought about her town .
The town had a vermiculite mine in it .
Vermiculite was used for soil conditioners , to make plants grow faster and better .
Vermiculite was used to insulate lofts , huge amounts of it put under the roof to keep houses warm during the long Montana winters .
Vermiculite was in the playground .
It was in the football ground .
What she didn &apos;t learn until she started working this problem is vermiculite is a very toxic form of asbestos .
When she figured out the puzzle , she started telling everyone she could what had happened , what had been done to her parents and to the people that she saw on oxygen tanks at home in the afternoons .
But she was really amazed .
The advent of the Internet definitely helped her .
She talked to anybody she could .
So now she had an ally .
Nevertheless , people still didn &apos;t want to know .
They said things like , &quot; &quot; Well , if it were really dangerous , someone would have told us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If that &apos;s really why everyone was dying , the doctors would have told us . &quot; &quot; Some of the guys used to very heavy jobs said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be a victim .
I can &apos;t possibly be a victim , and anyway , every industry has its accidents . &quot; &quot; But still Gayla went on , and finally she succeeded in getting a federal agency to come to town and to screen the inhabitants of the town — 15,000 people — and what they discovered was that the town had a mortality rate 80 times higher than anywhere in the United States .
That was in 2002 , and even at that moment , no one raised their hand to say , &quot; &quot; Gayla , look in the playground where your grandchildren are playing .
It &apos;s lined with vermiculite . &quot; &quot; This wasn &apos;t ignorance .
It was willful blindness .
You have chosen not to know .
There &apos;s a lot of willful blindness around these days .
You can see willful blindness in banks , when thousands of people sold mortgages to people who couldn &apos;t afford them .
You could see them in banks when interest rates were manipulated and everyone around knew what was going on , but everyone studiously ignored it .
You can see willful blindness in the Catholic Church , where decades of child abuse went ignored .
You could see willful blindness in the run-up to the Iraq War .
Willful blindness exists on epic scales like those , and it also exists on very small scales , in people &apos;s families , in people &apos;s homes and communities , and particularly in organizations and institutions .
Eighty-five percent of people know there &apos;s a problem , but they won &apos;t say anything .
And when I duplicated the research in Europe , asking all the same questions , I found exactly the same number .
Eighty-five percent . That &apos;s a lot of silence .
It &apos;s a lot of blindness .
And the truth is , this is a human problem .
We &apos;re all , under certain circumstances , willfully blind .
And some people are blind because they think , well , seeing anything is just futile .
Nothing &apos;s ever going to change .
If we make a protest , if we protest against the Iraq War , nothing changes , so why bother ?
Better not to see this stuff at all .
But what I &apos;ve found going around the world and talking to whistleblowers is , actually , they &apos;re very loyal and quite often very conservative people .
They &apos;re hugely dedicated to the institutions that they work for , and the reason that they speak up , the reason they insist on seeing , is because they care so much about the institution and want to keep it healthy .
And the other thing that people often say about whistleblowers is , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s no point , because you see what happens to them .
They are crushed .
Nobody would want to go through something like that . &quot; &quot; And yet , when I talk to whistleblowers , the recurrent tone that I hear is pride .
I think of Joe Darby .
We all remember the photographs of Abu Ghraib , which so shocked the world and showed the kind of war that was being fought in Iraq .
But I wonder who remembers Joe Darby , the very obedient , good soldier who found those photographs and handed them in .
And he said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not the kind of guy to rat people out , but some things just cross the line .
Ignorance is bliss , they say , but you can &apos;t put up with things like this . &quot; &quot; I talked to Steve Bolsin , a British doctor , who fought for five years to draw attention to a dangerous surgeon who was killing babies .
She came up to me one night , and she just said , &apos; Dad , you can &apos;t let the kids die . &apos; &quot; &quot; Or I think of Cynthia Thomas , a really loyal army daughter and army wife , who , as she saw her friends and relations coming back from the Iraq War , was so shocked by their mental condition and the refusal of the military to recognize and acknowledge post-traumatic stress syndrome that she set up a cafe in the middle of a military town to give them legal , psychological and medical assistance .
And she said to me , she said , &quot; &quot; You know , Margaret , I always used to say I didn &apos;t know what I wanted to be when I grow up .
But freedom doesn &apos;t exist if you don &apos;t use it , and what whistleblowers do , and what people like Gayla Benefield do is they use the freedom that they have .
And what they &apos;re very prepared to do is recognize that yes , this is going to be an argument , and yes I &apos;m going to have a lot of rows with my neighbors and my colleagues and my friends , but I &apos;m going to become very good at this conflict .
I &apos;m going to take on the naysayers , because they &apos;ll make my argument better and stronger .
I can collaborate with my opponents to become better at what I do .
These are people of immense persistence , incredible patience , and an absolute determination not to be blind and not to be silent .
When I went to Libby , Montana , I visited the asbestosis clinic that Gayla Benefield brought into being , a place where at first some of the people who wanted help and needed medical attention went in the back door because they didn &apos;t want to acknowledge that she &apos;d been right .
I sat in a diner , and I watched as trucks drove up and down the highway , carting away the earth out of gardens and replacing it with fresh , uncontaminated soil .
I took my 12-year-old daughter with me , because I really wanted her to meet Gayla .
And she said , &quot; &quot; Why ? What &apos;s the big deal ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; She &apos;s not a movie star , and she &apos;s not a celebrity , and she &apos;s not an expert , and Gayla &apos;s the first person who &apos;d say she &apos;s not a saint .
The really important thing about Gayla is she is ordinary .
She &apos;s like you , and she &apos;s like me .
She had freedom , and she was ready to use it . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
( Applause )
All right , so let &apos;s take four subjects that obviously go together : big data , tattoos , immortality and the Greeks .
Right ?
Now , the issue about tattoos is that , without a word , tattoos really do shout .
&#91; Beautiful &#93; &#91; Intriguing &#93; So you don &apos;t have to say a lot .
&#91; Allegiance &#93; &#91; Very intimate &#93; &#91; Serious mistakes &#93; ( Laughter ) And tattoos tell you a lot of stories .
If I can ask an indiscreet question , how many of you have tattoos ?
A few , but not most .
What happens if Facebook , Google , Twitter , LinkedIn , cell phones , GPS , Foursquare , Yelp , Travel Advisor , all these things you deal with every day turn out to be electronic tattoos ?
And what if they provide as much information about who and what you are as any tattoo ever would ?
What &apos;s ended up happening over the past few decades is the kind of coverage that you had as a head of state or as a great celebrity is now being applied to you every day by all these people who are Tweeting , blogging , following you , watching your credit scores and what you do to yourself .
And electronic tattoos also shout .
And as you &apos;re thinking of the consequences of that , it &apos;s getting really hard to hide from this stuff , among other things , because it &apos;s not just the electronic tattoos , it &apos;s facial recognition that &apos;s getting really good .
So you can take a picture with an iPhone and get all the names , although , again , sometimes it does make mistakes . ( Laughter ) But that means you can take a typical bar scene like this , take a picture , say , of this guy right here , get the name , and download all the records before you utter a word or speak to somebody , because everybody turns out to be absolutely plastered by electronic tattoos .
And so there &apos;s companies like face.com that now have about 18 billion faces online .
Here &apos;s what happened to this company .
&#91; Company sold to Facebook , June 18 , 2012 ... &#93; There are other companies that will place a camera like this — this has nothing to do with Facebook — they take your picture , they tie it to the social media , they figure out you really like to wear black dresses , so maybe the person in the store comes up and says , &quot; &quot; Hey , we &apos;ve got five black dresses that would just look great on you . &quot; &quot; So what if Andy was wrong ?
Here &apos;s Andy &apos;s theory .
&#91; In the future , everybody will be world famous for 15 minutes . &#93; What if we flip this ?
What if you &apos;re only going to be anonymous for 15 minutes ? ( Laughter ) Well , then , because of electronic tattoos , maybe all of you and all of us are very close to immortality , because these tattoos will live far longer than our bodies will .
And if that &apos;s true , then what we want to do is we want to go through four lessons from the Greeks and one lesson from a Latin American .
Why the Greeks ?
Well , the Greeks thought about what happens when gods and humans and immortality mix for a long time .
So lesson number one : Sisyphus .
Remember ? He did a horrible thing , condemned for all time to roll this rock up , it would roll back down , roll back up , roll back down .
It &apos;s a little like your reputation .
Once you get that electronic tattoo , you &apos;re going to be rolling up and down for a long time , so as you go through this stuff , just be careful what you post .
Myth number two : Orpheus , wonderful guy , charming to be around , great partier , great singer , loses his beloved , charms his way into the underworld , only person to charm his way into the underworld , charms the gods of the underworld , they release his beauty on the condition he never look at her until they &apos;re out .
So he &apos;s walking out and walking out and walking out and he just can &apos;t resist . He looks at her , loses her forever .
With all this data out here , it might be a good idea not to look too far into the past of those you love .
Lesson number three : Atalanta .
Greatest runner . She would challenge anybody .
If you won , she would marry you .
If you lost , you died .
How did Hippomenes beat her ?
Well , he had all these wonderful little golden apples , and she &apos;d run ahead , and he &apos;d roll a little golden apple .
She &apos;d run ahead , and he &apos;d roll a little golden apple .
She kept getting distracted . He eventually won the race .
Just remember the purpose as all these little golden apples come and reach you and you want to post about them or tweet about them or send a late-night message .
And then , of course , there &apos;s Narcissus .
Nobody here would ever be accused or be familiar with Narcissus .
( Laughter ) But as you &apos;re thinking about Narcissus , just don &apos;t fall in love with your own reflection .
Last lesson , from a Latin American : This is the great poet Jorge Luis Borges .
When he was threatened by the thugs of the Argentine military junta , he came back and said , &quot; &quot; Oh , come on , how else can you threaten , other than with death ? &quot; &quot; The interesting thing , the original thing , would be to threaten somebody with immortality .
And that , of course , is what we are all now threatened with today because of electronic tattoos .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Well , as Alexander Graham Bell famously said on his first successful telephone call , &quot; Hello , is that Domino &apos;s Pizza ? &quot;
( Laughter ) I just really want to thank you very much .
As another famous man , Jerry Garcia , said , &quot; What a strange , long trip . &quot;
And he should have said , &quot; What a strange , long trip it &apos;s about to become . &quot;
At this very moment , you are viewing my upper half .
My lower half is appearing at a different conference ( Laughter ) in a different country .
You can , it turns out , be in two places at once .
But still , I &apos;m sorry I can &apos;t be with you in person .
I &apos;ll explain at another time .
And though I &apos;m a rock star , I just want to assure you that none of my wishes will include a hot tub .
But what really turns me on about technology is not just the ability to get more songs on MP3 players .
The revolution — this revolution — is much bigger than that .
I hope , I believe .
What turns me on about the digital age , what excites me personally , is that you have closed the gap between dreaming and doing .
You see , it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song , you needed a studio and a producer .
Now , you need a laptop .
If you wanted to make a film , you needed a mass of equipment and a Hollywood budget .
Now , you need a camera that fits in your palm , and a couple of bucks for a blank DVD .
Imagination has been decoupled from the old constraints .
And that really , really excites me .
I &apos;m excited when I glimpse that kind of thinking writ large .
What I would like to see is idealism decoupled from all constraints .
Political , economic , psychological , whatever .
The geopolitical world has got a lot to learn from the digital world .
From the ease with which you swept away obstacles that no one knew could even be budged .
And that &apos;s actually what I &apos;d like to talk about today .
First , though , I should probably explain why , and how , I got to this place .
It &apos;s a journey that started 20 years ago .
You may remember that song , &quot; &quot; We Are the World , &quot; &quot; or , &quot; &quot; Do They Know It &apos;s Christmas ? &quot; &quot; Band Aid , Live Aid .
Another very tall , grizzled rock star , my friend Sir Bob Geldof , issued a challenge to &quot; &quot; feed the world . &quot; &quot; It was a great moment , and it utterly changed my life .
That summer , my wife , Ali , and myself went to Ethiopia .
We went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on .
We lived in Ethiopia for a month , working at an orphanage .
The children had a name for me .
They called me , &quot; &quot; The girl with the beard . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Don &apos;t ask .
Anyway , we found Africa to be a magical place .
Big skies , big hearts , big , shining continent .
Beautiful , royal people .
Anybody who ever gave anything to Africa got a lot more back .
Ethiopia didn &apos;t just blow my mind ; it opened my mind .
Anyway , on our last day at this orphanage a man handed me his baby and said , &quot; Would you take my son with you ? &quot;
He knew , in Ireland , that his son would live , and that in Ethiopia , his son would die .
It was the middle of that awful famine .
Well , I turned him down .
And it was a funny kind of sick feeling , but I turned him down .
And it &apos;s a feeling I can &apos;t ever quite forget .
And in that moment , I started this journey .
In that moment , I became the worst thing of all : I became a rock star with a cause . ( Laughter ) Except this isn &apos;t the cause , is it ?
Six-and-a-half thousand Africans dying every single day from AIDS — a preventable , treatable disease — for lack of drugs we can get in any pharmacy .
That &apos;s not a cause . That &apos;s an emergency .
11 million AIDS orphans in Africa , 20 million by the end of the decade .
That &apos;s not a cause . That &apos;s an emergency .
Today , every day , 9,000 more Africans will catch HIV because of stigmatization and lack of education .
That &apos;s not a cause . That &apos;s an emergency .
So what we &apos;re talking about here is human rights .
The right to live like a human .
The right to live , period .
And what we &apos;re facing in Africa is an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality .
The next thing I &apos;d like to be clear about is what this problem is , and what this problem isn &apos;t .
Because this is not all about charity .
This is about justice . Really .
This is not about charity . This is about justice .
That &apos;s right .
And that &apos;s too bad , because we &apos;re very good at charity .
Americans , like Irish people , are good at it .
Even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford .
We like to give , and we give a lot .
Look at the response to the tsunami — it &apos;s inspiring .
But justice is a tougher standard than charity .
You see , Africa makes a fool of our idea of justice .
It makes a farce of our idea of equality .
It mocks our pieties . It doubts our concern .
It questions our commitment .
Because there is no way we can look at what &apos;s happening in Africa , and if we &apos;re honest , conclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else .
As you heard in the film , anywhere else , not here .
Not here , not in America , not in Europe .
In fact , a head of state that you &apos;re all familiar with admitted this to me . And it &apos;s really true .
There is no chance this kind of hemorrhaging of human life would be accepted anywhere else other than Africa .
Africa is a continent in flames .
And deep down , if we really accepted that Africans were equal to us , we would all do more to put the fire out .
We &apos;re standing around with watering cans , when what we really need is the fire brigade .
You see , it &apos;s not as dramatic as the tsunami .
It &apos;s crazy , really , when you think about it .
Does stuff have to look like an action movie these days to exist in the front of our brain ?
The slow extinguishing of countless lives is just not dramatic enough , it would appear .
Catastrophes that we can avert are not as interesting as ones we could avert .
Funny , that .
Anyway , I believe that that kind of thinking offends the intellectual rigor in this room .
Six-and-a-half thousand people dying a day in Africa may be Africa &apos;s crisis , but the fact that it &apos;s not on the nightly news , that we in Europe , or you in America , are not treating it like an emergency — I want to argue with you tonight that that &apos;s our crisis .
I want to argue that though Africa is not the front line in the war against terror , it could be soon .
Every week , religious extremists take another African village .
They &apos;re attempting to bring order to chaos .
Well , why aren &apos;t we ?
Poverty breeds despair . We know this .
Despair breeds violence . We know this .
In turbulent times , isn &apos;t it cheaper , and smarter , to make friends out of potential enemies than to defend yourself against them later ?
&quot; The war against terror is bound up in the war against poverty . &quot;
And I didn &apos;t say that . Colin Powell said that .
Now when the military are telling us that this is a war that cannot be won by military might alone , maybe we should listen .
There &apos;s an opportunity here , and it &apos;s real .
It &apos;s not spin . It &apos;s not wishful thinking .
The problems facing the developing world afford us in the developed world a chance to re-describe ourselves to the world .
We will not only transform other people &apos;s lives , but we will also transform the way those other lives see us .
And that might be smart in these nervous , dangerous times .
Don &apos;t you think that on a purely commercial level , that anti-retroviral drugs are great advertisements for Western ingenuity and technology ?
Doesn &apos;t compassion look well on us ?
And let &apos;s cut the crap for a second .
In certain quarters of the world , brand EU , brand USA , is not at its shiniest .
The neon sign is fizzing and cracking .
Someone &apos;s put a brick through the window .
The regional branch managers are getting nervous .
Never before have we in the west been so scrutinized .
Our values : do we have any ?
Our credibility ?
These things are under attack around the world .
Brand USA could use some polishing .
And I say that as a fan , you know ?
As a person who buys the products .
But think about it .
More anti-retrovirals make sense .
But that &apos;s just the easy part , or ought to be .
But equality for Africa — that &apos;s a big , expensive idea .
You see , the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference .
What on earth can we all do about this ?
Well , much more than we think .
We can &apos;t fix every problem , but the ones we can , I want to argue , we must .
And because we can , we must .
This is the straight truth , the righteous truth .
It is not a theory .
The fact is that ours is the first generation that can look disease and extreme poverty in the eye , look across the ocean to Africa , and say this , and mean it : we do not have to stand for this .
A whole continent written off — we do not have to stand for this .
( Applause ) And let me say this without a trace of irony — before I back it up to a bunch of ex-hippies .
Forget the &apos; 60s . We can change the world .
I can &apos;t ; you can &apos;t , as individuals ; but we can change the world .
I really believe that , the people in this room .
Look at the Gates Foundation .
They &apos;ve done incredible stuff , unbelievable stuff .
But working together , we can actually change the world .
We can turn the inevitable outcomes , and transform the quality of life for millions of lives who look and feel rather like us , when you &apos;re up close .
I &apos;m sorry to laugh here , but you do look so different than you did in Haight-Ashbury in the &apos; 60s .
( Laughter ) But I want to argue that this is the moment that you are designed for .
It is the flowering of the seeds you planted in earlier , headier days .
Ideas that you gestated in your youth .
This is what excites me .
This room was born for this moment , is really what I want to say to you tonight .
Most of you started out wanting to change the world , didn &apos;t you ?
Most of you did , the digital world .
Well , now , actually because of you , it is possible to change the physical world .
It &apos;s a fact .
Economists confirm it , and they know much more than I do .
So why , then , are we not pumping our fists into the air ?
Probably because when we admit we can do something about it , we &apos;ve got to do something about it .
It is a pain in the arse .
This equality business is actually a pain in the arse .
But for the first time in history , we have the technology ; we have the know-how ; we have the cash ; we have the life-saving drugs .
Do we have the will ?
I hope this is obvious , but I &apos;m not a hippie .
And I &apos;m not really one for the warm , fuzzy feeling .
I do not have flowers in my hair .
Actually , I come from punk rock .
The Clash wore big army boots , not sandals .
But I know toughness when I see it .
And for all the talk of peace and love on the West Coast , there was muscle to the movement that started out here .
You see , idealism detached from action is just a dream .
But idealism allied with pragmatism , with rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit , is very exciting . It &apos;s very real . It &apos;s very strong .
And it &apos;s very present in a crowd like you .
Last year at DATA , this organization I helped set up , we launched a campaign to summon this spirit in the fight against AIDS and extreme poverty .
We &apos;re calling it the ONE Campaign .
It &apos;s based on our belief that the action of one person can change a lot , but the actions of many coming together as one can change the world .
Well , we feel that now is the time to prove we &apos;re right .
There are moments in history when civilization redefines itself .
We believe this is one .
We believe that this could be the time when the world finally decides that the wanton loss of life in Africa is just no longer acceptable .
This could be the time that we finally get serious about changing the future for most people who live on planet Earth .
Momentum has been building .
Lurching a little , but it &apos;s building .
This year is a test for us all , especially the leaders of the G8 nations , who really are on the line here , with all the world in history watching .
I have been , of late , disappointed with the Bush Administration .
They started out with such promise on Africa .
They made some really great promises , and actually have fulfilled a lot of them .
But some of them they haven &apos;t .
They don &apos;t feel the push from the ground , is the truth .
But my disappointment has much more perspective when I talk to American people , and I hear their worries about the deficit , and the fiscal well being of their country .
I understand that .
But there &apos;s much more push from the ground than you &apos;d think , if we got organized .
What I try to communicate , and you can help me if you agree , is that aid for Africa is just great value for money at a time when America really needs it .
Putting it in the crassest possible terms , the investment reaps huge returns .
Not only in lives saved , but in goodwill , stability and security that we &apos;ll gain .
So this is what I hope that you will do , if I could be so bold , and not have it deducted from my number of wishes .
( Laughter ) What I hope is that beyond individual merciful acts , that you will tell the politicians to do right by Africa , by America and by the world .
Give them permission , if you like , to spend their political capital and your financial capital , your national purse on saving the lives of millions of people .
That &apos;s really what I would like you to do .
Because we also need your intellectual capital : your ideas , your skills , your ingenuity .
And you , at this conference , are in a unique position .
Some of the technologies we &apos;ve been talking about , you invented them , or at least revolutionized the way that they &apos;re used .
Together you have changed the zeitgeist from analog to digital , and pushed the boundaries .
And we &apos;d like you to give us that energy .
Give us that kind of dreaming , that kind of doing .
As I say , there &apos;re two things on the line here .
There &apos;s the continent Africa .
But there &apos;s also our sense of ourselves .
People are starting to figure this out .
Movements are springing up .
Artists , politicians , pop stars , priests , CEOs , NGOs , mothers &apos; unions , student unions .
A lot of people are getting together , and working under this umbrella I told you about earlier , the ONE Campaign .
I think they just have one idea in their mind , which is , where you live in the world should not determine whether you live in the world .
( Applause ) History , like God , is watching what we do .
When the history books get written , I think our age will be remembered for three things .
Really , it &apos;s just three things this whole age will be remembered for .
The digital revolution , yes .
The war against terror , yes .
And what we did or did not do to put out the fires in Africa .
Some say we can &apos;t afford to . I say we can &apos;t afford not to .
Thank you , thank you very much .
( Applause ) Okay , my three wishes .
The ones that TED has offered to grant .
You see , if this is true , and I believe it is , that the digital world you all created has uncoupled the creative imagination from the physical constraints of matter , this should be a piece of piss .
( Laughter ) I should add that this started out as a much longer list of wishes .
Most of them impossible , some of them impractical and one or two of them certainly immoral .
( Laughter ) This business , it gets to be addictive , you know what I mean , when somebody else is picking up the tab .
Anyway , here &apos;s number one .
I wish for you to help build a social movement of more than one million American activists for Africa .
That is my first wish .
I believe it &apos;s possible .
A few minutes ago , I talked about all the citizens &apos; campaigns that are springing up .
You know , there &apos;s lots out there .
And with this one campaign as our umbrella , my organization , DATA , and other groups , have been tapping into the energy and the enthusiasm that &apos;s out there from Hollywood into the heartland of America .
We know there &apos;s more than enough energy to power this movement .
We just need your help in making it happen .
We want all of you here , church America , corporate America , Microsoft America , Apple America , Coke America , Pepsi America , nerd America , noisy America .
We can &apos;t afford to be cool and sit this one out .
I do believe if we build a movement that &apos;s one million Americans strong , we &apos;re not going to be denied .
We will have the ear of Congress .
We &apos;ll be the first page in Condi Rice &apos;s briefing book , and right into the Oval Office .
If there &apos;s one million Americans — and I really know this — who are ready to make phone calls , who are ready to be on email , I am absolutely sure that we can actually change the course of history , literally , for the continent of Africa .
Anyway , so I &apos;d like your help in getting that signed up .
I know John Gage and Sun Microsystems are already on board for this , but there &apos;s lots of you we &apos;d like to talk to .
Right , my second wish , number two .
I would like one media hit for every person on the planet who is living on less than one dollar a day .
That &apos;s one billion media hits .
Could be on Google , could be on AOL .
Steve Case , Larry , Sergey — they &apos;ve done a lot already .
It could be NBC . It could be ABC .
Actually we &apos;re talking to ABC today about the Oscars .
We have a film , produced by Jon Kamen at Radical Media .
But you know , we want , we need some airtime for our ideas .
We need to get the math ; we need to get the statistics out to the American people .
I really believe that old Truman line , that if you give the American people the facts , they &apos;ll do the right thing .
And , the other thing that &apos;s important is that this is not Sally Struthers .
This has to be described as an adventure , not a burden .
( Video ) : One by one they step forward , a nurse , a teacher , a homemaker , and lives are saved .
The problem is enormous .
Every three seconds one person dies .
Another three seconds , one more .
The situation is so desperate in parts of Africa , Asia , even America , that aid groups , just as they did for the tsunami , are uniting as one , acting as one .
We can beat extreme poverty , starvation , AIDS .
But we need your help .
One more person , letter , voice will mean the difference between life and death for millions of people .
Please join us by working together .
Americans have an unprecedented opportunity .
We can make history .
We can start to make poverty history .
One , by one , by one .
Please visit ONE at this address .
We &apos;re not asking for your money . We &apos;re asking for your voice .
Bono : All right . I wish for TED to truly show the power of information , its power to rewrite the rules and transform lives , by connecting every hospital , health clinic and school in one African country .
And I would like it to be Ethiopia .
I believe we can connect every school in Ethiopia , every health clinic , every hospital — we can connect to the Internet .
That is my wish , my third wish .
I think it &apos;s possible .
I think we have the money and brains in the room to do that .
And that would be a mind-blowing wish to come true .
I &apos;ve been to Ethiopia , as I said earlier .
It &apos;s actually where it all started for me .
The idea that the Internet , which changed all of our lives , can transform a country — and a continent that has hardly made it to analog , let alone digital — blows my mind .
But it didn &apos;t start out that way .
The first long-distance line from Boston to New York was used in 1885 on the phone .
It was just nine years later that Addis Ababa was connected by phone to Harare , which is 500 kilometers away .
Since then , not that much has changed .
The average waiting time to get a landline in Ethiopia is actually about seven or eight years .
But wireless technology wasn &apos;t dreamt up then .
Anyway , I &apos;m Irish , and as you can see , I know how important talking is .
Communication is very important for Ethiopia — will transform the country .
Nurses getting better training , pharmacists being able to order supplies , doctors sharing their expertise in all aspects of medicine .
It &apos;s a very , very good idea to get them wired .
And that is my third and final wish for you at the TED conference .
Thank you very much once again .
( Applause )
Where do you come from ?
It &apos;s such a simple question , but these days , of course , simple questions bring ever more complicated answers .
People are always asking me where I come from , and they &apos;re expecting me to say India , and they &apos;re absolutely right insofar as 100 percent of my blood and ancestry does come from India .
Except , I &apos;ve never lived one day of my life there .
I can &apos;t speak even one word of its more than 22,000 dialects .
So I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve really earned the right to call myself an Indian .
means &quot; &quot; Where do you pay your taxes ?
I do actually feel more alien the longer I live there .
( Laughter ) And if &quot; &quot; Where do you come from ? &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; Which place goes deepest inside you and where do you try to spend most of your time ? &quot; &quot; then I &apos;m Japanese , because I &apos;ve been living as much as I can for the last 25 years in Japan .
Except , all of those years I &apos;ve been there on a tourist visa , and I &apos;m fairly sure not many Japanese would want to consider me one of them .
And I say all this just to stress how very old-fashioned and straightforward my background is , because when I go to Hong Kong or Sydney or Vancouver , most of the kids I meet are much more international and multi-cultured than I am .
And they have one home associated with their parents , but another associated with their partners , a third connected maybe with the place where they happen to be , a fourth connected with the place they dream of being , and many more besides .
And their whole life will be spent taking pieces of many different places and putting them together into a stained glass whole .
Home for them is really a work in progress .
And for more and more of us , home has really less to do with a piece of soil than , you could say , with a piece of soul .
And I &apos;d always felt this way , but it really came home to me , as it were , some years ago when I was climbing up the stairs in my parents &apos; house in California , and I looked through the living room windows and I saw that we were encircled by 70-foot flames , one of those wildfires that regularly tear through the hills of California and many other such places .
And three hours later , that fire had reduced my home and every last thing in it except for me to ash .
Of course , if anybody asked me then , &quot; Where is your home ? &quot;
I literally couldn &apos;t point to any physical construction .
My home would have to be whatever I carried around inside me .
And in so many ways , I think this is a terrific liberation .
Because when my grandparents were born , they pretty much had their sense of home , their sense of community , even their sense of enmity , assigned to them at birth , and didn &apos;t have much chance of stepping outside of that .
No coincidence that the president of the strongest nation on Earth is half-Kenyan , partly raised in Indonesia , has a Chinese-Canadian brother-in-law .
Already , we represent the fifth-largest nation on Earth .
And in fact , in Canada &apos;s largest city , Toronto , the average resident today is what used to be called a foreigner , somebody born in a very different country .
And I &apos;ve always felt that the beauty of being surrounded by the foreign is that it slaps you awake .
You can &apos;t take anything for granted .
Travel , for me , is a little bit like being in love , because suddenly all your senses are at the setting marked &quot; &quot; on . &quot; &quot; Suddenly you &apos;re alert to the secret patterns of the world .
The real voyage of discovery , as Marcel Proust famously said , consists not in seeing new sights , but in looking with new eyes .
And of course , once you have new eyes , even the old sights , even your home become something different .
Many of the people living in countries not their own are refugees who never wanted to leave home and ache to go back home .
But for the fortunate among us , I think the age of movement brings exhilarating new possibilities .
Certainly when I &apos;m traveling , especially to the major cities of the world , the typical person I meet today will be , let &apos;s say , a half-Korean , half-German young woman living in Paris .
And as soon as she meets a half-Thai , half-Canadian young guy from Edinburgh , she recognizes him as kin .
She realizes that she probably has much more in common with him than with anybody entirely of Korea or entirely of Germany .
So they become friends . They fall in love .
They move to New York City .
( Laughter ) Or Edinburgh .
And the little girl who arises out of their union will of course be not Korean or German or French or Thai or Scotch or Canadian or even American , but a wonderful and constantly evolving mix of all those places .
And potentially , everything about the way that young woman dreams about the world , writes about the world , thinks about the world , could be something different , because it comes out of this almost unprecedented blend of cultures .
Where you come from now is much less important than where you &apos;re going .
More and more of us are rooted in the future or the present tense as much as in the past .
And home , we know , is not just the place where you happen to be born .
It &apos;s the place where you become yourself .
And yet , there is one great problem with movement , and that is that it &apos;s really hard to get your bearings when you &apos;re in midair .
Some years ago , I noticed that I had accumulated one million miles on United Airlines alone .
You all know that crazy system , six days in hell , you get the seventh day free .
( Laughter ) And I began to think that really , movement was only as good as the sense of stillness that you could bring to it to put it into perspective .
And eight months after my house burned down , I ran into a friend who taught at a local high school , and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got the perfect place for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Really ? &quot; &quot; I said . I &apos;m always a bit skeptical when people say things like that .
&quot; &quot; Well — &quot; &quot; Here my friend hemmed and hawed — &quot; Well , actually it &apos;s a Catholic hermitage . &quot;
This was the wrong answer .
I had spent 15 years in Anglican schools , so I had had enough hymnals and crosses to last me a lifetime .
Several lifetimes , actually .
And as he had it , even the most restless , distractible , testosterone-addled 15-year-old Californian boy only had to spend three days in silence and something in him cooled down and cleared out .
He found himself .
And when I got out of my car , the air was pulsing .
The whole place was absolutely silent , but the silence wasn &apos;t an absence of noise .
It was really a presence of a kind of energy or quickening .
And at my feet was the great , still blue plate of the Pacific Ocean .
All around me were 800 acres of wild dry brush .
And I went down to the room in which I was to be sleeping .
And I sat down , and I began to write , and write , and write , even though I &apos;d gone there really to get away from my desk .
And by the time I got up , four hours had passed .
Night had fallen , and I went out under this great overturned saltshaker of stars , and I could see the tail lights of cars disappearing around the headlands 12 miles to the south .
And it really seemed like my concerns of the previous day vanishing .
And the next day , when I woke up in the absence of telephones and TVs and laptops , the days seemed to stretch for a thousand hours .
It was really all the freedom I know when I &apos;m traveling , but it also profoundly felt like coming home .
And I &apos;m not a religious person , so I didn &apos;t go to the services .
I just took walks along the monastery road and sent postcards to loved ones .
I looked at the clouds , and I did what is hardest of all for me to do usually , which is nothing at all .
And I started to go back to this place , and I noticed that I was doing my most important work there invisibly just by sitting still , and certainly coming to my most critical decisions the way I never could when I was racing from the last email to the next appointment .
And I thought back to that wonderful phrase I had learned as a boy from Seneca , in which he says , &quot; &quot; That man is poor not who has little but who hankers after more . &quot; &quot; And , of course , I &apos;m not suggesting that anybody here go into a monastery .
But I do think it &apos;s only by stopping movement that you can see where to go .
And it &apos;s only by stepping out of your life and the world that you can see what you most deeply care about and find a home .
And I &apos;ve noticed so many people now take conscious measures to sit quietly for 30 minutes every morning just collecting themselves in one corner of the room without their devices , or go running every evening , or leave their cell phones behind when they go to have a long conversation with a friend .
Movement is a fantastic privilege , and it allows us to do so much that our grandparents could never have dreamed of doing .
But movement , ultimately , only has a meaning if you have a home to go back to .
And home , in the end , is of course not just the place where you sleep .
It &apos;s the place where you stand .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Good morning .
Happy to see so many fine folks out here and so many smiling faces .
I have a very peculiar background , attitude and approach to the real world because I am a conjurer .
Now , I prefer that term over magician , because if I were a magician , that would mean that I use spells and incantations and weird gestures in order to accomplish real magic .
No , I don &apos;t do that ; I &apos;m a conjurer , who is someone who pretends to be a real magician . ( Laughter ) Now , how do we go about that sort of thing ?
We depend on the fact that audiences , such as yourselves , will make assumptions .
For example , when I walked up here and I took the microphone from the stand and switched it on , you assumed this was a microphone , which it is not .
( Laughter ) As a matter of fact , this is something that about half of you , more than half of you will not be familiar with .
It &apos;s a beard trimmer , you see ?
And it makes a very bad microphone ; I &apos;ve tried it many times . ( Laughter ) The other assumption that you made — and this little lesson is to show you that you will make assumptions .
Not only that you can , but that you will when they are properly suggested to you .
You believe I &apos;m looking at you .
Wrong . I &apos;m not looking at you . I can &apos;t see you .
I know you &apos;re out there , they told me backstage , it &apos;s a full house and such .
I know you &apos;re there because I can hear you , but I can &apos;t see you because I normally wear glasses .
These are not glasses , these are empty frames . ( Laughter ) Quite empty frames .
Now why would a grown man appear before you wearing empty frames on his face ?
To fool you , ladies and gentlemen , to deceive you , to show that you , too , can make assumptions .
Don &apos;t you ever forget that .
Now , I have to do something — first of all , switch to real glasses so I can actually see you , which would probably be a convenience . I don &apos;t know .
I haven &apos;t had a good look . Well , it &apos;s not that great a convenience .
( Laughter ) I have to do something now , which seems a little bit strange for a magician .
But I &apos;m going to take some medication .
This is a full bottle of Calms Forte .
I &apos;ll explain that in just a moment .
Ignore the instructions , that &apos;s what the government has to put in there to confuse you , I &apos;m sure .
I will take enough of these . Mm .
Indeed , the whole container .
Thirty-two tablets of Calms Forte .
Now that I &apos;ve done that — I &apos;ll explain it in a moment — I must tell you that I am an actor .
I &apos;m an actor who plays a specific part .
I play the part of a magician , a wizard , if you will , a real wizard .
If someone were to appear on this stage in front of me and actually claim to be an ancient prince of Denmark named Hamlet , you would be insulted and rightly so .
Why would a man assume that you would believe something bizarre like this ?
But there exists out there a very large population of people who will tell you that they have psychic , magical powers that they can predict the future , that they can make contact with the deceased .
Oh , they also say they will sell you astrology or other fortunetelling methods .
Oh , they gladly sell you that , yes .
And they also say that they can give you perpetual motion machines and free energy systems .
They claim to be psychics , or sensitives , whatever they can .
But the one thing that has made a big comeback just recently is this business of speaking with the dead .
Now , to my innocent mind , dead implies incapable of communicating . ( Laughter ) You might agree with me on that .
But these people , they tend to tell you that not only can they communicate with the dead — &quot; &quot; Hi , there &quot; &quot; — but they can hear the dead as well , and they can relay this information back to the living .
I wonder if that &apos;s true .
I don &apos;t think so , because this subculture of people use exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do , exactly the same — the same physical methods , the same psychological methods — and they effectively and profoundly deceive millions of people around the earth , to their detriment .
They deceive these people , costs them a lot of money , cost them a lot of emotional anguish .
Billions of dollars are spent every year , all over the globe , on these charlatans .
Now , I have two questions I would like to ask these people if I had the opportunity to do so .
First question : If I want to ask them to call up — because they do hear them through the ear .
They listen to the spirits like this — I &apos;m going to ask you to call up the ghost of my grandmother because , when she died , she had the family will , and she secreted it someplace . We don &apos;t know where it is , so we ask Granny , &quot; &quot; Where is the will , Granny ? &quot; &quot; What does Granny say ? She says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m in heaven and it &apos;s wonderful .
I &apos;m here with all my old friends , my deceased friends , and my family and all the puppy dogs and the kittens that I used to have when I was a little girl .
And I love you , and I &apos;ll always be with you .
Good bye . &quot; &quot; And she didn &apos;t answer the damn question !
Where is the will ?
Now , she could easily have said , &quot; Oh , it &apos;s in the library on the second shelf , behind the encyclopedia , &quot; but she doesn &apos;t say that . No , she doesn &apos;t .
She doesn &apos;t bring any useful information to us .
We paid a lot of money for that information , be we didn &apos;t get it .
The second question that I &apos;d like to ask , rather simple : Suppose I ask them to contact the spirit of my deceased father-in-law , as an example .
Why do they insist on saying — remember , they speak into this ear — why do they say , &quot; &quot; My name starts with J or M ? &quot; &quot; Is this a hunting game ?
Hunting and fishing ? What is it ?
Is it 20 questions ? No , it &apos;s more like 120 questions .
But it is a cruel , vicious , absolutely conscienceless — I &apos;ll be all right , keep your seats ( Laughter ) — game that these people play .
And they take advantage of the innocent , the naive , the grieving , the needy people out there .
Now , this is a process that is called cold reading .
There &apos;s one fellow out there , Van Praagh is his name , James Van Praagh .
He &apos;s one of the big practitioners of this sort of thing .
John Edward , Sylvia Browne and Rosemary Altea , they are other operators .
There are hundreds of them all over the earth , but in this country , James Van Praagh is very big .
And what does he do ? He likes to tell you how the deceased got deceased , the people he &apos;s talking to through his ear , you see ?
So what he says is , very often , is like this : he says , &quot; &quot; He tells me , he tells me , before he passed , that he had trouble breathing . &quot; &quot; Folks , that &apos;s what dying is all about !
( Laughter ) You stop breathing , and then you &apos;re dead .
It &apos;s that simple .
And that &apos;s the kind of information they &apos;re going to bring back to you ?
I don &apos;t think so .
Now , these people will make guesses , they &apos;ll say things like , &quot; &quot; Why am I getting electricity ?
He &apos;s saying to me , &apos; Electricity . &apos; Was he an electrician ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; &quot; Did he ever have an electric razor ? &quot; &quot; No . &quot;
It was a game of hunting questions like this .
This is what they go through .
Now , folks often ask us at the James Randi Educational Foundation , they call me , they say , &quot; &quot; Why are you so concerned about this , Mr. Randi ?
Isn &apos;t it just a lot of fun ? &quot; &quot; No , it is not fun . It is a cruel farce .
Now , it may bring a certain amount of comfort , but that comfort lasts only about 20 minutes or so .
And then the people look in the mirror , and they say , I just paid a lot of money for that reading .
And what did she say to me ? &apos; I love you ! &apos; &quot; &quot; They always say that .
They don &apos;t get any information , they don &apos;t get any value for what they spend .
Now , Sylvia Browne is the big operator .
We call her &quot; &quot; The Talons . &quot; &quot; Sylvia Browne — thank you — Sylvia Browne is the big operator in this field at this very moment .
Now , Sylvia Browne — just to show you — she actually gets 700 dollars for a 20 minute reading over the telephone , she doesn &apos;t even go there in person , and you have to wait up to two years because she &apos;s booked ahead that amount of time .
You pay by credit card or whatever , and then she will call you sometime in the next two years .
You can tell it &apos;s her . &quot; &quot; Hello , this is Sylvia Browne . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s her , you can tell right away .
Now , Montel Williams is an intelligent man .
We all know who he is on television .
He &apos;s well educated , he &apos;s smart , he knows what Sylvia Browne is doing but he doesn &apos;t give a damn .
He just doesn &apos;t care .
Because , the bottom line is , the sponsors love it , and he will expose her to television publicity all the time .
Now , what does Sylvia Browne give you for that 700 dollars ?
She gives you the names of your guardian angels , that &apos;s first .
Now , without that , how could we possibly function ? ( Laughter ) She gives you the names of previous lives , who you were in previous lives .
Duh .
It turns out that the women that she gives readings for were all Babylonian princesses , or something like that .
And the men were all Grecian warriors fighting with Agamemnon .
Nothing is ever said about a 14 year-old bootblack in the streets of London who died of consumption .
He isn &apos;t worth bringing back , obviously .
And the strange thing — folks , you may have noticed this too .
You see these folks on television — they never call anybody back from hell . ( Laughter ) Everyone comes back from heaven , but never from hell .
If they call back any of my friends , they &apos;re not going to ... Well , you see the story .
( Laughter ) Now , Sylvia Browne is an exception , an exception in one way , because the James Randi Educational Foundation , my foundation , offers a one million dollar prize in negotiable bonds .
Very simply won .
All you have to do is prove any paranormal , occult or supernatural event or power of any kind under proper observing conditions .
It &apos;s very easy , win the million dollars .
Sylvia Browne is an exception in that she &apos;s the only professional psychic in the whole world that has accepted our challenge .
She did this on the &quot; &quot; Larry King Live &quot; &quot; show on CNN six and a half years ago .
And we haven &apos;t heard from her since . Strange .
She said that , first of all , that she didn &apos;t know how to contact me .
Duh .
A professional psychic who speaks to dead people , she can &apos;t reach me ?
( Laughter ) I &apos;m alive , you may have noticed .
Well , pretty well anyway .
She couldn &apos;t reach me . Now she says she doesn &apos;t want to reach me because I &apos;m a godless person .
All the more reason to take the million dollars , wouldn &apos;t you think , Sylvia ?
Now these people need to be stopped , seriously now .
They need to be stopped because this is a cruel farce .
We get people coming to the foundation all the time .
They &apos;re ruined financially and emotionally because they &apos;ve given their money and their faith to these people .
Now , I popped some pills earlier .
I have to explain that to you .
Homeopathy , let &apos;s find out what that &apos;s all about .
Hmm . You &apos;ve heard of it .
It &apos;s an alternative form of healing , right ?
Homeopathy actually consists — and that &apos;s what this is .
This is Calms Forte , 32 caplets of sleeping pills ! I forgot to tell you that .
I just ingested six and a half days worth of sleeping pills .
( Laughter ) Six and a half days , that certainly is a fatal dose .
It says right on the back here , &quot; &quot; In case of overdose , contact your poison control center immediately , &quot; &quot; and it gives an 800 number .
Keep your seats — it &apos;s going to be okay .
I don &apos;t really need it because I &apos;ve been doing this stunt for audiences all over the world for the last eight or 10 years , taking fatal doses of homeopathic sleeping pills .
Why don &apos;t they affect me ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The answer may surprise you .
What is homeopathy ?
It &apos;s taking a medicine that really works and diluting it down well beyond Avogadro &apos;s limit .
Diluting it down to the point where there &apos;s none of it left . ( Laughter ) Now folks , this is not just a metaphor I &apos;m going to give you now , it &apos;s true .
It &apos;s exactly equivalent to taking one 325 milligram aspirin tablet , throwing it into the middle of Lake Tahoe , and then stirring it up , obviously with a very big stick , and waiting two years or so until the solution is homogeneous .
Then , when you get a headache , you take a sip of this water , and — voila ! — it is gone .
( Laughter ) Now that is true . That is what homeopathy is all about .
And another claim that they make — you &apos;ll love this one — the more dilute the medicine is , they say , the more powerful it is .
Now wait a minute , we heard about a guy in Florida .
The poor man , he was on homeopathic medicine .
He died of an overdose .
He forgot to take his pill .
( Laughter ) Work on it . Work on it .
It &apos;s a ridiculous thing . It is absolutely ridiculous .
I don &apos;t know what we &apos;re doing , believing in all this nonsense over all these years .
Now , let me tell you , The James Randi Educational Foundation is waving this very big carrot , but I must say , the fact that nobody has taken us up on this offer doesn &apos;t mean that the powers don &apos;t exist .
They might , some place out there .
Maybe these people are just independently wealthy .
Well , with Sylvia Browne I would think so .
You know , 700 dollars for a 20 minute reading over the telephone — that &apos;s more than lawyers make !
I mean that &apos;s a fabulous amount of money .
These people don &apos;t need the million dollars perhaps , but wouldn &apos;t you think they &apos;d like to take it just to make me look silly ?
Just to get rid of this godless person out there that Sylvia Browne talks about all the time ?
I think that something needs to be done about this .
We really would love to have suggestions from you folks on how to contact federal , state and local authorities to get them to do something .
If you find out — now I understand .
We &apos;ve seen people , even today , speaking to us about AIDS epidemics and starving kids around the world and impure water supplies that people have to suffer with .
Those are very important , critically important to us .
And we must do something about those problems .
But at the same time , as Arthur C. Clarke said , The rotting of the human mind , the business of believing in the paranormal and the occult and the supernatural — all of this total nonsense , this medieval thinking — I think something should be done about that , and it all lies in education .
Largely , it &apos;s the media who are to blame for this sort of thing .
They shamelessly promote all kinds of nonsense of this sort because it pleases the sponsors .
It &apos;s the bottom line , the dollar line .
That &apos;s what they &apos;re looking at .
We really must do something about this .
I &apos;m willing to take your suggestions , and I &apos;m willing to have you tune in to our webpage .
It &apos;s www.randi.org.
Go in there and look at the archives , and you will begin to understand much more of what I &apos;ve been talking about today .
You will see the records that we have .
There &apos;s nothing like sitting in that library and having a family appear there and say that Mum gave away all the family fortune .
She cashed in the CDs , she gave away the stocks and the certificates .
That &apos;s really sad to hear , and it hasn &apos;t helped them one bit , hasn &apos;t solved any of their problems .
Yes , there could be a rotting of the American mind , and of the minds all the way around the earth , if we don &apos;t start to think sensibly about these things .
Now , we &apos;ve offered this carrot , as I say , we &apos;ve dangled the carrot .
We &apos;re waiting for the psychics to come forth and snap at it .
Oh , we get lots of them , hundreds of them every year come by .
These are dowsers and people who think that they can talk to the dead as well , but they &apos;re amateurs ; they don &apos;t know how to evaluate their own so-called powers .
The professionals never come near us , except in that case of Sylvia Browne that I told you about a moment ago .
She did accept and then backed away .
Ladies and gentlemen , I &apos;m James Randi , and I &apos;m waiting .
Thank you .

My dad has Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
He started showing the symptoms about 12 years ago , and he was officially diagnosed in 2005 .
My dad was my hero and my mentor for most of my life , and I &apos;ve spent the last decade watching him disappear .
And because of that fear , we tend to do one of two things : We go into denial : &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not me , it has nothing to do with me , it &apos;s never going to happen to me . &quot; &quot; Or , we decide that we &apos;re going to prevent dementia , and it will never happen to us because we &apos;re going to do everything right and it won &apos;t come and get us .
But the research also shows that there &apos;s nothing that will 100 percent protect you .
My dad was a bilingual college professor . His hobbies were chess , bridge and writing op-eds .
( Laughter ) He got dementia anyway .
Especially if you &apos;re me , &apos; cause Alzheimer &apos;s tends to run in families .
You can &apos;t sit and have long talks with your old friends , because you don &apos;t know who they are .
It &apos;s confusing to watch television , and often very frightening .
And reading is just about impossible .
With my dad , that turned out to be letting him fill out forms .
He was a college professor at a state school ; he knows what paperwork looks like .
He &apos;ll sign his name on every line , he &apos;ll check all the boxes , he &apos;ll put numbers in where he thinks there should be numbers .
But , you know , it doesn &apos;t matter if I &apos;m actually good at it . What matters is that my hands know how to do it .
Because the more things that are familiar , the more things my hands know how to do , the more things that I can be happy and busy doing when my brain &apos;s not running the show anymore .
I want to be as happy as I can for as long as I can .
They get scared to walk around . They get scared to move .
So I &apos;m doing activities that will build my sense of balance .
I &apos;m doing yoga and tai chi to improve my balance , so that when I start to lose it , I &apos;ll still be able to be mobile .
I &apos;m doing weight-bearing exercise , so that I have the muscle strength so that when I start to wither , I have more time that I can still move around .
Finally , the third thing . I &apos;m trying to become a better person .
even when it &apos;s so hard .
When you take away everything that he ever learned in this world , his naked heart still shines .
And what I need now is to learn to be like that .
I need a heart so pure that if it &apos;s stripped bare by dementia , it will survive .
What I want is a cure in the next 20 years , soon enough to protect me .
But if it comes for me , I &apos;m going to be ready .
Thank you .

Wetlands , globally , are one of the most endangered ecosystems .
And then think of how large that very small section of one mine is .
That &apos;s like from Wall Street at the southern edge of Manhattan up to maybe 120th Street .
This might be , what ? I don &apos;t know , half the size of Manhattan .
This is the infrastructure as we see it about now .
And we can do that .
Last year at TED I gave an introduction to the LHC .
And I promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine worked .
So this is it . And for those of you that weren &apos;t there , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted — 27 kilometers in circumference .
Its job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began , up to 600 million times a second .
It &apos;s nothing if not ambitious .
This is the machine below Geneva .
We take the pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors .
This is the one I work on . It &apos;s called the ATLAS detector — 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter .
Spectacular picture here of ATLAS under construction so you can see the scale .
On the 10th of September last year we turned the machine on for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It caused immense celebration in the control room .
It &apos;s a picture of the first beam particle going all the way around the LHC , colliding with a piece of the LHC deliberately , and showering particles into the detector .
In other words , when we saw that picture on September 10th we knew the machine worked , which is a great triumph .
I don &apos;t know whether this got the biggest cheer , or this , when someone went onto Google and saw the front page was like that .
It means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact .
About a week later we had a problem with the machine , related actually to these bits of wire here — these gold wires .
Those wires carry 13 thousand amps when the machine is working in full power .
Now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say , &quot; No they don &apos;t . They &apos;re small wires . &quot;
They can do that because when they are very cold they are what &apos;s called superconducting wire .
So at minus 271 degrees , colder than the space between the stars , those wires can take that current .
In one of the joints between over 9,000 magnets in LHC , there was a manufacturing defect .
So the wire heated up slightly , and its 13,000 amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now that &apos;s more impressive when you consider those magnets weigh over 20 tons , and they moved about a foot .
So we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
We had to take them out , which we did .
We reconditioned them all , fixed them .
They &apos;re all on their way back underground now .
By the end of March the LHC will be intact again .
We will switch it on , and we expect to take data in June or July , and continue with our quest to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
Now of course , in a way those accidents reignite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge . It &apos;s easy to refute .
I think that the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that we &apos;re overreaching , is the value of things like the LHC .
I will leave the final word to an English scientist , Humphrey Davy , who , I suspect , when defending his protege &apos;s useless experiments — his protege was Michael Faraday — said this , &quot; &quot; Nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate , that there are no mysteries in nature , that our triumphs are complete , and that there are no new worlds to conquer . &quot; &quot; Thank you .

Now , if President Obama invited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics , then I would have a suggestion for him that I think would vastly improve the mathematics education in this country .
And it would be easy to implement and inexpensive .
The mathematics curriculum that we have is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra .
And everything we learn after that is building up towards one subject .
And at top of that pyramid , it &apos;s calculus .
And I &apos;m here to say that I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid ...
that the correct summit — that all of our students , every high school graduate should know — should be statistics : probability and statistics .
( Applause ) I mean , don &apos;t get me wrong . Calculus is an important subject .
It &apos;s one of the great products of the human mind .
The laws of nature are written in the language of calculus .
And every student who studies math , science , engineering , economics , they should definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college .
But I &apos;m here to say , as a professor of mathematics , that very few people actually use calculus in a conscious , meaningful way , in their day-to-day lives .
On the other hand , statistics — that &apos;s a subject that you could , and should , use on daily basis . Right ?
It &apos;s risk . It &apos;s reward . It &apos;s randomness .
It &apos;s understanding data .
I think if our students , if our high school students — if all of the American citizens — knew about probability and statistics , we wouldn &apos;t be in the economic mess that we &apos;re in today . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Not only — thank you — not only that ...
but if it &apos;s taught properly , it can be a lot of fun .
I mean , probability and statistics , it &apos;s the mathematics of games and gambling .
It &apos;s analyzing trends . It &apos;s predicting the future .
Look , the world has changed from analog to digital .
And it &apos;s time for our mathematics curriculum to change from analog to digital , from the more classical , continuous mathematics , to the more modern , discrete mathematics — the mathematics of uncertainty , of randomness , of data — that being probability and statistics .
In summary , instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus , I think it would be far more significant if all of them knew what two standard deviations from the mean means . And I mean it .
Thank you very much .

Seventy-thousand years ago , our ancestors were insignificant animals .
The most important thing to know about prehistoric humans is that they were unimportant .
Their impact on the world was not much greater than that of jellyfish or fireflies or woodpeckers .
Today , in contrast , we control this planet .
And the question is : How did we come from there to here ?
How did we turn ourselves from insignificant apes , minding their own business in a corner of Africa , into the rulers of planet Earth ?
Usually , we look for the difference between us and all the other animals on the individual level .
We want to believe — I want to believe — that there is something special about me , about my body , about my brain , that makes me so superior to a dog or a pig , or a chimpanzee .
But the truth is that , on the individual level , I &apos;m embarrassingly similar to a chimpanzee .
And if you take me and a chimpanzee and put us together on some lonely island , and we had to struggle for survival to see who survives better , I would definitely place my bet on the chimpanzee , not on myself .
And this is not something wrong with me personally .
I guess if they took almost any one of you , and placed you alone with a chimpanzee on some island , the chimpanzee would do much better .
The real difference between humans and all other animals is not on the individual level ; it &apos;s on the collective level .
Humans control the planet because they are the only animals that can cooperate both flexibly and in very large numbers .
Now , there are other animals — like the social insects , the bees , the ants — that can cooperate in large numbers , but they don &apos;t do so flexibly .
Their cooperation is very rigid .
There is basically just one way in which a beehive can function .
And if there &apos;s a new opportunity or a new danger , the bees cannot reinvent the social system overnight .
They cannot , for example , execute the queen and establish a republic of bees , or a communist dictatorship of worker bees .
Other animals , like the social mammals — the wolves , the elephants , the dolphins , the chimpanzees — they can cooperate much more flexibly , but they do so only in small numbers , because cooperation among chimpanzees is based on intimate knowledge , one of the other .
I &apos;m a chimpanzee and you &apos;re a chimpanzee , and I want to cooperate with you .
I need to know you personally .
What kind of chimpanzee are you ?
Are you a nice chimpanzee ?
Are you an evil chimpanzee ?
Are you trustworthy ?
If I don &apos;t know you , how can I cooperate with you ?
The only animal that can combine the two abilities together and cooperate both flexibly and still do so in very large numbers is us , Homo sapiens .
One versus one , or even 10 versus 10 , chimpanzees might be better than us .
But , if you pit 1,000 humans against 1,000 chimpanzees , the humans will win easily , for the simple reason that a thousand chimpanzees cannot cooperate at all .
And if you now try to cram 100,000 chimpanzees into Oxford Street , or into Wembley Stadium , or Tienanmen Square or the Vatican , you will get chaos , complete chaos .
Just imagine Wembley Stadium with 100,000 chimpanzees .
Complete madness .
In contrast , humans normally gather there in tens of thousands , and what we get is not chaos , usually .
What we get is extremely sophisticated and effective networks of cooperation .
All the huge achievements of humankind throughout history , whether it &apos;s building the pyramids or flying to the moon , have been based not on individual abilities , but on this ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers .
Think even about this very talk that I &apos;m giving now : I &apos;m standing here in front of an audience of about 300 or 400 people , most of you are complete strangers to me .
Similarly , I don &apos;t really know all the people who have organized and worked on this event .
I don &apos;t know the pilot and the crew members of the plane that brought me over here , yesterday , to London .
I don &apos;t know the people who invented and manufactured this microphone and these cameras , which are recording what I &apos;m saying .
I don &apos;t know the people who wrote all the books and articles that I read in preparation for this talk .
And I certainly don &apos;t know all the people who might be watching this talk over the Internet , somewhere in Buenos Aires or in New Delhi .
Nevertheless , even though we don &apos;t know each other , we can work together to create this global exchange of ideas .
This is something chimpanzees cannot do .
They communicate , of course , but you will never catch a chimpanzee traveling to some distant chimpanzee band to give them a talk about bananas or about elephants , or anything else that might interest chimpanzees .
Now cooperation is , of course , not always nice ; all the horrible things humans have been doing throughout history — and we have been doing some very horrible things — all those things are also based on large-scale cooperation .
Prisons are a system of cooperation ; slaughterhouses are a system of cooperation ; concentration camps are a system of cooperation .
Chimpanzees don &apos;t have slaughterhouses and prisons and concentration camps .
Now suppose I &apos;ve managed to convince you perhaps that yes , we control the world because we can cooperate flexibly in large numbers .
The next question that immediately arises in the mind of an inquisitive listener is : How , exactly , do we do it ?
What enables us alone , of all the animals , to cooperate in such a way ?
The answer is our imagination .
We can cooperate flexibly with countless numbers of strangers , because we alone , of all the animals on the planet , can create and believe fictions , fictional stories .
And as long as everybody believes in the same fiction , everybody obeys and follows the same rules , the same norms , the same values .
All other animals use their communication system only to describe reality .
A chimpanzee may say , &quot; &quot; Look ! There &apos;s a lion , let &apos;s run away ! &quot; &quot; Or , &quot; &quot; Look ! There &apos;s a banana tree over there ! Let &apos;s go and get bananas ! &quot; &quot; Humans , in contrast , use their language not merely to describe reality , but also to create new realities , fictional realities .
A human can say , &quot; &quot; Look , there is a god above the clouds !
And if you don &apos;t do what I tell you to do , when you die , God will punish you and send you to hell . &quot; &quot; And if you all believe this story that I &apos;ve invented , then you will follow the same norms and laws and values , and you can cooperate .
This is something only humans can do .
You can never convince a chimpanzee to give you a banana by promising him , &quot; &quot; ... after you die , you &apos;ll go to chimpanzee heaven ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; ... and you &apos;ll receive lots and lots of bananas for your good deeds .
So now give me this banana . &quot; &quot; No chimpanzee will ever believe such a story .
Only humans believe such stories , which is why we control the world , whereas the chimpanzees are locked up in zoos and research laboratories .
Now you may find it acceptable that yes , in the religious field , humans cooperate by believing in the same fictions .
Millions of people come together to build a cathedral or a mosque or fight in a crusade or a jihad , because they all believe in the same stories about God and heaven and hell .
But what I want to emphasize is that exactly the same mechanism underlies all other forms of mass-scale human cooperation , not only in the religious field .
Take , for example , the legal field .
Most legal systems today in the world are based on a belief in human rights .
But what are human rights ?
Human rights , just like God and heaven , are just a story that we &apos;ve invented .
They are not an objective reality ; they are not some biological effect about homo sapiens .
Take a human being , cut him open , look inside , you will find the heart , the kidneys , neurons , hormones , DNA , but you won &apos;t find any rights .
The only place you find rights are in the stories that we have invented and spread around over the last few centuries .
They may be very positive stories , very good stories , but they &apos;re still just fictional stories that we &apos;ve invented .
The same is true of the political field .
The most important factors in modern politics are states and nations .
But what are states and nations ?
They are not an objective reality .
A mountain is an objective reality .
You can see it , you can touch it , you can even smell it .
But a nation or a state , like Israel or Iran or France or Germany , this is just a story that we &apos;ve invented and became extremely attached to .
The same is true of the economic field .
The most important actors today in the global economy are companies and corporations .
Many of you today , perhaps , work for a corporation , like Google or Toyota or McDonald &apos;s .
What exactly are these things ?
They are what lawyers call legal fictions .
They are stories invented and maintained by the powerful wizards we call lawyers .
( Laughter ) And what do corporations do all day ?
Mostly , they try to make money .
Yet , what is money ?
Again , money is not an objective reality ; it has no objective value .
Take this green piece of paper , the dollar bill .
Look at it — it has no value .
You cannot eat it , you cannot drink it , you cannot wear it .
But then came along these master storytellers — the big bankers , the finance ministers , the prime ministers — and they tell us a very convincing story : &quot; &quot; Look , you see this green piece of paper ?
It is actually worth 10 bananas . &quot; &quot; And if I believe it , and you believe it , and everybody believes it , it actually works .
I can take this worthless piece of paper , go to the supermarket , give it to a complete stranger whom I &apos;ve never met before , and get , in exchange , real bananas which I can actually eat .
This is something amazing .
You could never do it with chimpanzees .
Chimpanzees trade , of course : &quot; Yes , you give me a coconut , I &apos;ll give you a banana . &quot;
That can work .
But , you give me a worthless piece of paper and you except me to give you a banana ?
No way !
What do you think I am , a human ?
( Laughter ) Money , in fact , is the most successful story ever invented and told by humans , because it is the only story everybody believes .
Not everybody believes in God , not everybody believes in human rights , not everybody believes in nationalism , but everybody believes in money , and in the dollar bill .
Take , even , Osama Bin Laden .
He hated American politics and American religion and American culture , but he had no objection to American dollars .
He was quite fond of them , actually .
( Laughter ) To conclude , then : We humans control the world because we live in a dual reality .
All other animals live in an objective reality .
Their reality consists of objective entities , like rivers and trees and lions and elephants .
We humans , we also live in an objective reality .
In our world , too , there are rivers and trees and lions and elephants .
But over the centuries , we have constructed on top of this objective reality a second layer of fictional reality , a reality made of fictional entities , like nations , like gods , like money , like corporations .
And what is amazing is that as history unfolded , this fictional reality became more and more powerful so that today , the most powerful forces in the world are these fictional entities .
Today , the very survival of rivers and trees and lions and elephants depends on the decisions and wishes of fictional entities , like the United States , like Google , like the World Bank — entities that exist only in our own imagination .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Bruno Giussani : Yuval , you have a new book out .
After Sapiens , you wrote another one , and it &apos;s out in Hebrew , but not yet translated into ...
Yuval Noah Harari : I &apos;m working on the translation as we speak .
BG : In the book , if I understand it correctly , you argue that the amazing breakthroughs that we are experiencing right now not only will potentially make our lives better , but they will create — and I quote you — &quot; ... new classes and new class struggles , just as the industrial revolution did . &quot;
Can you elaborate for us ?
YNH : Yes . In the industrial revolution , we saw the creation of a new class of the urban proletariat .
And much of the political and social history of the last 200 years involved what to do with this class , and the new problems and opportunities .
Now , we see the creation of a new massive class of useless people .
( Laughter ) As computers become better and better in more and more fields , there is a distinct possibility that computers will out-perform us in most tasks and will make humans redundant .
And then the big political and economic question of the 21st century will be , &quot; &quot; What do we need humans for ? &quot; &quot; , or at least , &quot; &quot; What do we need so many humans for ? &quot; &quot; BG : Do you have an answer in the book ?
YNH : At present , the best guess we have is to keep them happy with drugs and computer games ...
( Laughter ) but this doesn &apos;t sound like a very appealing future .
BG : Ok , so you &apos;re basically saying in the book and now , that for all the discussion about the growing evidence of significant economic inequality , we are just kind of at the beginning of the process ?
YNH : Again , it &apos;s not a prophecy ; it &apos;s seeing all kinds of possibilities before us .
One possibility is this creation of a new massive class of useless people .
Another possibility is the division of humankind into different biological castes , with the rich being upgraded into virtual gods , and the poor being degraded to this level of useless people .
BG : I feel there is another TED talk coming up in a year or two .
Thank you , Yuval , for making the trip .
YNH : Thanks !

Four years ago , on the TED stage , I announced a company I was working with at the time called Odeo .
And because of that announcement , we got a big article in The New York Times , which led to more press , which led to more attention , and me deciding to become CEO of that company — whereas I was just an adviser — and raising a round of venture capital and ramping up hiring .
One of the guys I hired was an engineer named Jack Dorsey , and a year later , when we were trying to decide which way to go with Odeo , Jack presented an idea he &apos;d been tinkering around with for a number of years that was based around sending simple status updates to friends .
We were also playing with SMS at the time at Odeo , so we kind of put two and two together , and in early 2006 we launched Twitter as a side project at Odeo .
Now , it &apos;s hard to justify doing a side project at a startup , where focus is so critical , but I had actually launched Blogger as a side project to my previous company , thinking it was just a little thing we &apos;d do on the side , and it ended up taking over not only the company , but my life for the next five or six years .
So I learned to follow hunches even though you can &apos;t necessarily justify them or know where they &apos;re going to go .
And that &apos;s kind of what &apos;s happened with Twitter , time after time .
So , for those of you unfamiliar , Twitter is based around a very simple , seemingly trivial concept .
You say what you &apos;re doing in 140 characters or less , and people who are interested in you get those updates .
If they &apos;re really interested , they get the update as a text message on their cell phone .
So , for instance , I may Twitter right now that I &apos;m giving a talk at TED .
And in my case , when I hit send , up to 60,000 people will receive that message in a matter of seconds .
Now , the fundamental idea is that Twitter lets people share moments of their lives whenever they want , be they momentous occasions or mundane ones .
It is by sharing these moments as they &apos;re happening that lets people feel more connected and in touch , despite distance , and in real time .
This is the primary use we saw of Twitter from the beginning , and what got us excited .
What we didn &apos;t anticipate was the many , many other uses that would evolve from this very simple system .
One of the things we realized was how important Twitter could be during real-time events .
When the wildfires broke out in San Diego , in October of 2007 , people turned to Twitter to report what was happening and to find information from neighbors about what was happening around them .
But it wasn &apos;t just individuals .
The L.A. Times actually turned to Twitter to dispense information as well , and put a Twitter feed on the front page , and the L.A. Fire Department and Red Cross used it to dispense news and updates as well .
At this event , dozens of people here are Twittering and thousands of people around the world are following along because they want to know what it feels like to be here and what &apos;s happening .
Among the other interesting things that have cropped up are many things from businesses , from marketing and communications and predictable things , to an insanely popular Korean-barbecue taco truck that drives around L.A. and Twitters where it stops , causing a line to form around the block .
Politicians have recently begun Twittering .
In fact , there are 47 members of Congress who currently have Twitter accounts .
And they &apos;re tweeting , in some cases , from behind closed-door sessions with the President .
In this case , this guy &apos;s not liking what he &apos;s hearing .
The President himself is our most popular Twitter user , although his tweets have dropped off as of late , while Senator McCain &apos;s have picked up .
As have this guy &apos;s .
Twitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium : you send one message and it goes out to everybody , and you receive the messages you &apos;re interested in .
One of the many ways that users shaped the evolution of Twitter was by inventing a way to reply to a specific person or a specific message .
So , this syntax , the &quot; &quot; @ username &quot; &quot; that Shaquille O &apos;Neal &apos;s using here to reply to one of his fans , was completely invented by users , and we didn &apos;t build it into the system until it already became popular and then we made it easier .
This is one of the many ways that users have shaped the system .
Another is via the API .
We built an application-programming interface , which basically means that programmers can write software that interacts with Twitter .
We currently know about over 2,000 pieces of software that can send Twitter updates — interfaces for Mac , Windows , your iPhone , your BlackBerry — as well as things like a device that lets an unborn baby Twitter when it kicks or a plant Twitter when it needs water .
Probably the most important third-party development came from a little company in Virginia called Summize .
Summize built a Twitter search engine .
And they tapped into the fact that , if you have millions of people around the world talking about what they &apos;re doing and what &apos;s around them , you have an incredible resource to find out about any topic or event while it &apos;s going on .
This really changed how we perceived Twitter .
For instance , here &apos;s what people are saying about TED .
This is another way that our mind was shifted , and Twitter wasn &apos;t what we thought it was .
We liked this so much we actually bought the company and are folding it into the main product .
This not only lets you view Twitters in different ways , but it introduces new use cases as well .
One of my favorites is what happened a few months ago when there was a gas shortage in Atlanta .
Some users figured out that they would Twitter when they found gas — where it was , and how much it cost — and then appended the keyword &quot; &quot; # atlgas &quot; &quot; which let other people search for that and find gas themselves .
And this trend of people using this communication network to help each other out goes far beyond the original idea of just keeping up with family and friends .
It &apos;s happened more and more lately , whether it &apos;s raising money for homeless people or to dig wells in Africa or for a family in crisis .
People have raised tens of thousands of dollars over Twitter in a matter of days on several occasions .
It seems like when you give people easier ways to share information , more good things happen .
I have no idea what will happen next with Twitter .
I &apos;ve learned to follow the hunch , but never assume where it will go .
Thanks .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : We &apos;re not quite done yet .
So , look , if we could have this screen live .
This is actually the most terrifying thing that any speaker can do after they &apos;ve been to an event .
It &apos;s totally intimidating .
So , this would be the Twitter search screen .
So we &apos;re going to just type a couple of random words into Twitter .
For example : &quot; &quot; Evan Williams . &quot; &quot; &quot; Evan Williams , give people more good ways to share information and follow your hunch at TED . &quot;
&quot; Currently listening to Evan Williams . &quot; &quot; Currently listening to Evan Williams . &quot; &quot; Evan Williams — &quot; Oh .
&quot; &quot; Evan Williams is just dying on stage here at TED .
Worst talk ever ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Evan Williams : Nice . Thanks .
CA : Just kidding .
But , literally in the eight minutes he was talking , there are about fifty tweets that already came on the talk .
So he &apos;ll see every aspect of the reaction : the fact that Barack Obama is the biggest Twitterer , the fact that it came out of TED .
I don &apos;t think there &apos;s any other way of getting instant feedback that way .
You have build something very fascinating , and it looks like its best times are still ahead of it .
So , thank you very much , Evan . EW : Thank you .
CA : That was very interesting .
My journey to become a polar specialist , photographing , specializing in the polar regions , began when I was four years old , when my family moved from southern Canada to Northern Baffin Island , up by Greenland .
There we lived with the Inuit in the tiny Inuit community of 200 Inuit people , where &#91; we &#93; were one of three non-Inuit families .
And in this community , we didn &apos;t have a television ; we didn &apos;t have computers , obviously , radio .
We didn &apos;t even have a telephone .
All of my time was spent outside with the Inuit , playing .
The snow and the ice were my sandbox , and the Inuit were my teachers .
And that &apos;s where I became truly obsessed with this polar realm .
And I knew someday that I was going to do something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protect it .
I &apos;d like to share with you , for just two minutes only , some images , a cross-section of my work , to the beautiful music by Brandi Carlile , &quot; &quot; Have You Ever . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know why National Geographic has done this , they &apos;ve never done this before , but they &apos;re allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that I &apos;ve just completed that is not published yet .
National Geographic doesn &apos;t do this , so I &apos;m very excited to be able to share this with you .
And what these images are — you &apos;ll see them at the start of the slide show — there &apos;s only about four images — but it &apos;s of a little bear that lives in the Great Bear Rainforest .
It &apos;s pure white , but it &apos;s not a polar bear .
It &apos;s a spirit bear , or a Kermode bear .
There are only 200 of these bears left .
They &apos;re more rare than the panda bear .
I sat there on the river for two months without seeing one .
I thought , my career &apos;s over .
I proposed this stupid story to National Geographic .
What in the heck was I thinking ?
So I had two months to sit there and figure out different ways of what I was going to do in my next life , after I was a photographer , because they were going to fire me .
Because National Geographic is a magazine ; they remind us all the time : they publish pictures , not excuses .
( Laughter ) And after two months of sitting there — one day , thinking that it was all over , this incredible big white male came down , right beside me , three feet away from me , and he went down and grabbed a fish and went off in the forest and ate it .
And then I spent the entire day living my childhood dream of walking around with this bear through the forest .
He went through this old-growth forest and sat up beside this 400-year-old culturally modified tree and went to sleep .
And I actually got to sleep within three feet of him , just in the forest , and photograph him .
So I &apos;m very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross-section of my work that I &apos;ve done on the polar regions .
Please enjoy .

Thank you very much . I appreciate it .
We &apos;re inundated with news all the time that the sea ice is disappearing and it &apos;s at its lowest level .
And in fact , scientists were originally saying sea ice is going to disappear in the next hundred years , then they said 50 years .
Now they &apos;re saying the sea ice in the Arctic , the summertime extent is going to be gone in the next four to 10 years .
And what does that mean ?
After a while of reading this in the news , it just becomes news .
You glaze over with it .
And what I &apos;m trying to do with my work is put faces to this .
And I want people to understand and get the concept that , if we lose ice , we stand to lose an entire ecosystem .
Projections are that we could lose polar bears , they could become extinct in the next 50 to 100 years .
And there &apos;s no better , sexier , more beautiful , charismatic megafauna species for me to hang my campaign on .
Polar bears are amazing hunters .
This was a bear I sat with for a while on the shores .
There was no ice around .
But this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it .
And this bear swam out to that seal — 800 lb. bearded seal — grabbed it , swam back and ate it .
And he was so full , he was so happy and so fat eating this seal , that , as I approached him — about 20 feet away — to get this picture , his only defense was to keep eating more seal .
And as he ate , he was so full — he probably had about 200 lbs of meat in his belly — and as he ate inside one side of his mouth , he was regurgitating out the other side of his mouth .
So as long as these bears have any bit of ice they will survive , but it &apos;s the ice that &apos;s disappearing .
We &apos;re finding more and more dead bears in the Arctic .
When I worked on polar bears as a biologist 20 years ago , we never found dead bears .
And in the last four or five years , we &apos;re finding dead bears popping up all over the place .
We &apos;re seeing them in the Beaufort Sea , floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out .
I found a couple in Norway last year . We &apos;re seeing them on the ice .
These bears are already showing signs of the stress of disappearing ice .
Here &apos;s a mother and her two year-old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere , and they &apos;re riding on this big piece of glacier ice , which is great for them ; they &apos;re safe at this point .
They &apos;re not going to die of hypothermia .
They &apos;re going to get to land .
But unfortunately , 95 percent of the glaciers in the Arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem .
These ringed seals , these are the &quot; &quot; fatsicles &quot; &quot; of the Arctic .
These little , fat dumplings , 150-pound bundles of blubber are the mainstay of the polar bear .
And they &apos;re not like the harbor seals that you have here .
These ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice .
They give birth inside the ice , and they feed on the Arctic cod that live under the ice .
And here &apos;s a picture of sick ice .
This is a piece of multi-year ice that &apos;s 12 years old .
And what scientists didn &apos;t predict is that , as this ice melts , these big pockets of black water are forming and they &apos;re grabbing the sun &apos;s energy and accelerating the melting process .
And here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea .
The visibility &apos;s 600 ft . ; we &apos;re on our safety lines ; the ice is moving all over the place .
I wish I could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive .
But what &apos;s important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi-year ice , that big chunk of ice up in the corner .
In that one single piece of ice , you have 300 species of microorganisms .
And in the spring , when the sun returns to the ice , it forms the phytoplankton , grows under that ice , and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed , and then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life .
So really what the ice does is it acts like a garden .
It acts like the soil in a garden . It &apos;s an inverted garden .
Losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden .
Here &apos;s me in my office .
I hope you appreciate yours .
This is after an hour under the ice .
I can &apos;t feel my lips ; my face is frozen ; I can &apos;t feel my hands ; I can &apos;t feel my feet .
And I &apos;ve come up , and all I wanted to do was get out of the water .
After an hour in these conditions , it &apos;s so extreme that , when I go down , almost every dive I vomit into my regulator because my body can &apos;t deal with the stress of the cold on my head .
And so I &apos;m just so happy that the dive is over .
I get to hand my camera to my assistant , and I &apos;m looking up at him , and I &apos;m going , &quot; &quot; Woo . Woo . Woo . &quot; &quot; Which means , &quot; &quot; Take my camera . &quot; &quot; And he thinks I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; Take my picture . &quot; &quot; So we had this little communication breakdown .
( Laughter ) But it &apos;s worth it .
I &apos;m going to show you pictures of beluga whales , bowhead whales , and narwhals , and polar bears , and leopard seals today , but this picture right here means more to me than any other I &apos;ve ever made .
I dropped down in this ice hole , just through that hole that you just saw , and I looked up under the underside of the ice , and I was dizzy ; I thought I had vertigo .
I got very nervous — no rope , no safety line , the whole world is moving around me — and I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m in trouble . &quot; &quot; But what happened is that the entire underside was full of these billions of amphipods and copepods moving around and feeding on the underside of the ice , giving birth and living out their entire life cycle .
This is the foundation of the whole food chain in the Arctic , right here .
And when you have low productivity in this , in ice , the productivity in copepods go down .
This is a bowhead whale .
Supposedly , science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now .
This very whale right here could be over 250 years old .
This whale could have been born around the start of the Industrial Revolution .
It could have survived 150 years of whaling .
And now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the North because of the lives that we &apos;re leading in the South .
Narwhals , these majestic narwhals with their eight-foot long ivory tusks , don &apos;t have to be here ; they could be out on the open water .
But they &apos;re forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe , catch a breath , because right under that ice are all the swarms of cod .
And the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods .
Alright , my favorite part .
When I &apos;m on my deathbed , I &apos;m going to remember one story more than any other .
Even though that spirit bear moment was powerful , I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll ever have another experience like I did with these leopard seals .
Leopard seals , since the time of Shackleton , have had a bad reputation .
They &apos;ve got that wryly smile on their mouth .
They &apos;ve got those black sinister eyes and those spots on their body .
They look positively prehistoric and a bit scary .
And tragically in &#91; 2003 &#93; , a scientist was taken down and drowned , and she was being consumed by a leopard seal .
And people were like , &quot; &quot; We knew they were vicious . We knew they were . &quot; &quot; And so people love to form their opinions .
And that &apos;s when I got a story idea : I want to go to Antarctica , get in the water with as many leopard seals as I possibly can and give them a fair shake — find out if they really are these vicious animals , or if they &apos;re misunderstood .
So this is that story .
Oh , and they also happen to eat Happy Feet .
( Laughter ) As a species , as humans , we like to say penguins are really cute , therefore , leopard seals eat them , so leopard seals are ugly and bad .
It doesn &apos;t work that way .
The penguin doesn &apos;t know it &apos;s cute , and the leopard seal doesn &apos;t know it &apos;s kind of big and monstrous .
This is just the food chain unfolding .
They &apos;re also big .
They &apos;re not these little harbor seals .
They are 12 ft. long , a thousand pounds .
And they &apos;re also curiously aggressive .
You get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac , floating in these icy waters , and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon .
The boat starts to sink , they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked .
All the leopard seal was doing — it &apos;s just biting a balloon .
It just sees this big balloon in the ocean — it doesn &apos;t have hands — it &apos;s going to take a little bite , the boat pops , and off they go .
( Laughter ) So after five days of crossing the Drake Passage — isn &apos;t that beautiful — after five days of crossing the Drake Passage , we have finally arrived at Antarctica .
I &apos;m with my Swedish assistant and guide .
His name is Goran Ehlme from Sweden — Goran .
And he has a lot of experience with leopard seals . I have never seen one .
So we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat , and there &apos;s this monstrous leopard seal .
And even in his voice , he goes , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a bloody big seal , ya . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And this seal is taking this penguin by the head , and it &apos;s flipping it back and forth .
And what it &apos;s trying to do is turn that penguin inside-out , so it can eat the meat off the bones , and then it goes off and gets another one .
And so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin , came under the boat , the Zodiac , starting hitting the hull of the boat .
And we &apos;re trying to not fall in the water .
And we sit down , and that &apos;s when Goran said to me , &quot; &quot; This is a good seal , ya .
It &apos;s time for you to get in the water . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I looked at Goran , and I said to him , &quot; &quot; Forget that . &quot; &quot; But I think I probably used a different word starting with the letter &quot; &quot; F. &quot; &quot; But he was right .
He scolded me out , and said , &quot; &quot; This is why we &apos;re here .
And you purposed this stupid story to National Geographic .
And now you &apos;ve got to deliver .
And you can &apos;t publish excuses . &quot; &quot; So I had such dry mouth — probably not as bad as now — but I had such , such dry mouth .
And my legs were just trembling . I couldn &apos;t feel my legs .
I put my flippers on . I could barely part my lips .
I put my snorkel in my mouth , and I rolled over the side of the Zodiac into the water .
And this was the first thing she did .
She came racing up to me , engulfed my whole camera — and her teeth are up here and down here — but Goran , before I had gotten in the water , had given me amazing advice .
He said , &quot; &quot; If you get scared , you close your eyes , ya , and she &apos;ll go away . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So that &apos;s all I had to work with at that point .
But I just started to shoot these pictures .
So she did this threat display for a few minutes , and then the most amazing thing happened — she totally relaxed .
She went off , she got a penguin .
She stopped about 10 feet away from me , and she sat there with this penguin , the penguin &apos;s flapping , and she let &apos;s it go .
The penguin swims toward me , takes off .
She grabs another one . She does this over and over .
And it dawned on me that she &apos;s trying to feed me a penguin .
Why else would she release these penguins at me ?
And after she did this four or five times , she swam by me with this dejected look on her face .
You don &apos;t want to be too anthropomorphic , but I swear that she looked at me like , &quot; &quot; This useless predator &apos;s going to starve in my ocean . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So realizing I couldn &apos;t catch swimming penguins , she &apos;d get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me , bobbing like this , and she &apos;d let them go .
This didn &apos;t work .
I was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding , because I was crying underwater , just because it was so amazing .
And so that didn &apos;t work .
So then she &apos;d get another penguin and try this ballet-like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this . ( Laughter ) And she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me .
This went on for four days .
This just didn &apos;t happen a couple of times .
And then so she realized I couldn &apos;t catch live ones , so she brought me dead penguins .
( Laughter ) Now I &apos;ve got four or five penguins floating around my head , and I &apos;m just sitting there shooting away .
And she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like , &quot; &quot; Are you for real ? &quot; &quot; Because she can &apos;t believe I can &apos;t eat this penguin .
Because in her world , you &apos;re either breeding or you &apos;re eating — and I &apos;m not breeding , so ...
( Laughter ) And then that wasn &apos;t enough ; she started to flip penguins onto my head .
She was trying to force-feed me . She &apos;s pushing me around .
She &apos;s trying to force-feed my camera , which is every photographer &apos;s dream .
And she would get frustrated ; she &apos;d blow bubbles in my face .
She would , I think , let me know that I was going to starve .
But yet she didn &apos;t stop .
She would not stop trying to feed me penguins .
And on the last day with this female where I thought I had pushed her too far , I got nervous because she came up to me , she rolled over on her back , and she did this deep , guttural jackhammer sound , this gok-gok-gok-gok .
And I thought , she &apos;s about to bite .
She &apos;s about to let me know she &apos;s too frustrated with me .
What had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me , and she did that to threat display .
She chased that big seal away , went and got its penguin and brought it to me .
( Laughter ) That wasn &apos;t the only seal I got in the water with .
I got in the water with 30 other leopard seals , and I never once had a scary encounter .
They are the most remarkable animals I &apos;ve ever worked with , and the same with polar bears .
And just like the polar bears , these animals depend on an icy environment .
I get emotional . Sorry .
It &apos;s a story that lives deep in my heart , and I &apos;m proud to share this with you .
And I &apos;m so passionate about it .
Anybody want to come with me to Antarctica or the Arctic , I &apos;ll take you ; let &apos;s go .
We &apos;ve got to get the story out now . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Thank you . Thanks very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
So , I am indeed going to talk about the spaces men create for themselves , but first I want to tell you why I &apos;m here .
I &apos;m here for two reasons . These two guys are my two sons Ford and Wren .
When Ford was about three years old , we shared a very small room together , in a very small space .
My office was on one half of the bedroom , and his bedroom was on the other half .
And you can imagine , if you &apos;re a writer , that things would get really crowded around deadlines .
So when Wren was on the way , I realized I needed to find a space of my own .
There was no more space in the house . So I went out to the backyard , and without any previous building experience , and about 3,000 dollars and some recycled materials , I built this space .
It had everything I needed . It was quiet .
There was enough space . And I had control , which was very important .
As I was building this space , I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; Surely I &apos;m not the only guy to have to have carved out a space for his own . &quot; &quot; So I did some research .
And I found that there was an historic precedence .
Hemingway had his writing space .
Elvis had two or three manspaces , which is pretty unique because he lived with both his wife and his mother in Graceland .
In the popular culture , Superman had the Fortress of Solitude , and there was , of course , the Batcave .
So I realized then that I wanted to go out on a journey and see what guys were creating for themselves now .
Here is one of the first spaces I found . It is in Austin , Texas , which is where I &apos;m from .
On the outside it looks like a very typical garage , a nice garage .
But on the inside , it &apos;s anything but .
And this , to me , is a pretty classic manspace .
It has neon concert posters , a bar and , of course , the leg lamp , which is very important .
I soon realized that manspaces didn &apos;t have to be only inside .
This guy built a bowling alley in his backyard , out of landscaping timbers , astroturf .
And he found the scoreboard in the trash .
Here &apos;s another outdoor space , a little bit more sophisticated .
This a 1923 wooden tugboat , made completely out of Douglas fir .
The guy did it all himself .
And there is about 1,000 square feet of hanging-out space inside .
So , pretty early on in my investigations I realized what I was finding was not what I expected to find , which was , quite frankly , a lot of beer can pyramids and overstuffed couches and flat-screen TVs .
There were definitely hang-out spots .
But some were for working , some were for playing , some were for guys to collect their things .
Most of all , I was just surprised with what I was finding .
Take this place for example .
On the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage .
This is in Long Island , New York .
The only thing that might tip you off is the round window .
On the inside it &apos;s a recreation of a 16th century Japanese tea house .
The man imported all the materials from Japan , and he hired a Japanese carpenter to build it in the traditional style .
It has no nails or screws .
All the joints are hand-carved and hand-scribed .
Here is another pretty typical scene . This is a suburban Las Vegas neighborhood .
But you open one of the garage doors and there is a professional-size boxing ring inside .
( Laughter ) And so there is a good reason for this .
It was built by this man who is Wayne McCullough .
He won the silver medal for Ireland in the 1992 Olympics , and he trains in this space . He trains other people .
And right off the garage he has his own trophy room where he can sort of bask in his accomplishments , which is another sort of important part about a manspace .
So , while this space represents someone &apos;s profession , this one certainly represents a passion .
It &apos;s made to look like the inside of an English sailing ship .
It &apos;s a collection of nautical antiques from the 1700s and 1800s .
Museum quality .
So , as I came to the end of my journey , I found over 50 spaces .
And they were unexpected and they were surprising .
But they were also — I was really impressed by how personalized they were , and how much work went into them .
And I realized that &apos;s because the guys that I met were all very passionate about what they did .
And they really loved their professions .
And they were very passionate about their collections and their hobbies .
And so they created these spaces to reflect what they love to do , and who they were .
So if you don &apos;t have a space of your own , I highly recommend finding one , and getting into it .
Thank you very much .

Come with me to the bottom of the world , Antarctica , the highest , driest , windiest , and yes , coldest region on Earth — more arid than the Sahara and , in parts , colder than Mars .
The ice of Antarctica glows with a light so dazzling , it blinds the unprotected eye .
Early explorers rubbed cocaine in their eyes to kill the pain of it .
The weight of the ice is such that the entire continent sags below sea level , beneath its weight .
Yet , the ice of Antarctica is a calendar of climate change .
It records the annual rise and fall of greenhouse gases and temperatures going back before the onset of the last ice ages .
Nowhere on Earth offers us such a perfect record .
And here , scientists are drilling into the past of our planet to find clues to the future of climate change .
This past January , I traveled to a place called WAIS Divide , about 600 miles from the South Pole .
It is the best place on the planet , many say , to study the history of climate change .
There , about 45 scientists from the University of Wisconsin , the Desert Research Institute in Nevada and others have been working to answer a central question about global warming .
What is the exact relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and planetary temperatures ?
It &apos;s urgent work . We know that temperatures are rising .
This past May was the warmest worldwide on record .
And we know that levels of greenhouse gases are rising too .
What we don &apos;t know is the exact , precise , immediate impact of these changes on natural climate patterns — winds , ocean currents , precipitation rates , cloud formation , things that bear on the health and well-being of billions of people .
Their entire camp , every item of gear , was ferried 885 miles from McMurdo Station , the main U.S. supply base on the coast of Antarctica .
WAIS Divide itself though , is a circle of tents in the snow .
In blizzard winds , the crew sling ropes between the tents so that people can feel their way safely to the nearest ice house and to the nearest outhouse .
It snows so heavily there , the installation was almost immediately buried .
Indeed , the researchers picked this site because ice and snow accumulates here 10 times faster than anywhere else in Antarctica .
They have to dig themselves out every day .
It makes for an exotic and chilly commute .
( Laughter ) But under the surface is a hive of industrial activity centered around an eight-million-dollar drill assembly .
Periodically , this drill , like a biopsy needle , plunges thousands of feet deep into the ice to extract a marrow of gases and isotopes for analysis .
Ten times a day , they extract the 10-foot long cylinder of compressed ice crystals that contain the unsullied air and trace chemicals laid down by snow , season after season for thousands of years .
It &apos;s really a time machine .
At the peak of activity earlier this year , the researchers lowered the drill an extra hundred feet deeper into the ice every day and another 365 years deeper into the past .
Periodically , they remove a cylinder of ice , like gamekeepers popping a spent shotgun shell from the barrel of a drill .
They inspect it , they check it for cracks , for drill damage , for spalls , for chips .
More importantly , they prepare it for inspection and analysis by 27 independent laboratories in the United States and Europe , who will examine it for 40 different trace chemicals related to climate , some in parts per quadrillion .
Yes , I said that with a Q , quadrillion .
They cut the cylinders up into three-foot sections for easier handling and shipment back to these labs , some 8,000 miles from the drill site .
Each cylinder is a parfait of time .
This ice formed as snow 15,800 years ago , when our ancestors were daubing themselves with paint and considering the radical new technology of the alphabet .
Bathed in polarized light and cut in cross-section , this ancient ice reveals itself as a mosaic of colors , each one showing how conditions at depth in the ice have affected this material at depths where pressures can reach a ton per square inch .
Every year , it begins with a snowflake , and by digging into fresh snow , we can see how this process is ongoing today .
This wall of undisturbed snow , back-lit by sunlight , shows the striations of winter and summer snow , layer upon layer .
Each storm scours the atmosphere , washing out dust , soot , trace chemicals , and depositing them on the snow pack year after year , millennia after millennia , creating a kind of periodic table of elements that at this point is more than 11,000 feet thick .
From this , we can detect an extraordinary number of things .
We can see the calcium from the world &apos;s deserts , soot from distant wildfires , methane as an indicator of the strength of a Pacific monsoon , all wafted on winds from warmer latitudes to this remote and very cold place .
Most importantly , these cylinders and this snow trap air .
Each cylinder is about 10 percent ancient air , a pristine time capsule of greenhouse gases — carbon dioxide , methane , nitrous oxide — all unchanged from the day that snow formed and first fell .
And this is the object of their scrutiny .
But don &apos;t we already know what we need to know about greenhouse gases ?
Why do we need to study this anymore ?
Don &apos;t we already know how they affect temperatures ?
Don &apos;t we already know the consequences of a changing climate on our settled civilization ?
The truth is , we only know the outlines , and what we don &apos;t completely understand , we can &apos;t properly fix .
Indeed , we run the risk of making things worse .
Consider , the single most successful international environmental effort of the 20th century , the Montreal Protocol , in which the nations of Earth banded together to protect the planet from the harmful effects of ozone-destroying chemicals used at that time in air conditioners , refrigerators and other cooling devices .
We banned those chemicals , and we replaced them , unknowingly , with other substances that , molecule per molecule , are a hundred times more potent as heat-trapping , greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide .
This process requires extraordinary precautions .
The scientists must insure that the ice is not contaminated .
Moreover , in this 8,000-mile journey , they have to insure this ice doesn &apos;t melt .
Imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics .
They have to , in fact , make sure this ice never gets warmer than about 20 degrees below zero , otherwise , the key gases inside it will dissipate .
So , in the coldest place on Earth , they work inside a refrigerator .
As they handle the ice , in fact , they keep an extra pair of gloves warming in an oven , so that , when their work gloves freeze and their fingers stiffen , they can don a fresh pair .
They work against the clock and against the thermometer .
So far , they &apos;ve packed up about 4,500 feet of ice cores for shipment back to the United States .
This past season , they manhandled them across the ice to waiting aircraft .
The 109th Air National Guard flew the most recent shipment of ice back to the coast of Antarctica , where it was boarded onto a freighter , shipped across the tropics to California , unloaded , put on a truck , driven across the desert to the National Ice Core Laboratory in Denver , Colorado , where , as we speak , scientists are now slicing this material up for samples , for analysis , to be distributed to the laboratories around the country and in Europe .
Antarctica was this planet &apos;s last empty quarter — the blind spot in our expanding vision of the world .
Early explorers sailed off the edge of the map , and they found a place where the normal rules of time and temperature seem suspended .
Here , the ice seems a living presence .
The wind that rubs against it gives it voice .
It is a voice of experience .
It is a voice we should heed .
Thank you .

That &apos;s an in-joke , by the way .
The third question is , why is it hotter in summer than in winter ?
Would you be able to do that ?
Was he beheaded in the end , or hung ?
And I — you know , normally , I would pick people out and humiliate , but maybe not in this instance .
Now , I passed all my biology exams in Britain .
Yes , you can , and I &apos;ll show you in a second how to do that .
Now , here &apos;s how you do the battery and the bulb .
It &apos;s so easy , isn &apos;t it ? Of course , you all knew that .
That &apos;s pretty much what you should have on your piece of paper . Right ?
And this is NASA &apos;s view . They &apos;re stunningly similar .
So , these mental models — we look for evidence that reinforces our models .
So , children are not empty vessels , OK ?
But this applies , equally , to matters of trying to sell new technology .
Poor teaching actually does more harm than good .
Your homework is — you know , how does an aircraft &apos;s wing create lift ?
An obvious question , and you &apos;ll have an answer now in your heads .
And the second question to that then is , ensure you &apos;ve explained how it is that planes can fly upside down .
Ah ha , right . Second question is , why is the sea blue ? All right ?
And you &apos;ve all got an idea in your head of the answer .
So , why is it blue on cloudy days ? Ah , see .
You may have heard about the Koran &apos;s idea of paradise being 72 virgins , and I promise I will come back to those virgins .
But in fact , here in the northwest , we &apos;re living very close to the real Koranic idea of paradise , defined 36 times as &quot; &quot; gardens watered by running streams . &quot; &quot; Since I live on a houseboat on the running stream of Lake Union , this makes perfect sense to me .
But the thing is , how come it &apos;s news to most people ?
I know many well-intentioned non-Muslims who &apos;ve begun reading the Koran , but given up , disconcerted by its &quot; &quot; otherness . &quot; &quot; The historian Thomas Carlyle considered Muhammad one of the world &apos;s greatest heroes , yet even he called the Koran &quot; &quot; as toilsome reading as I ever undertook , a wearisome , confused jumble . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Part of the problem , I think , is that we imagine that the Koran can be read as we usually read a book — as though we can curl up with it on a rainy afternoon with a bowl of popcorn within reach , as though God — and the Koran is entirely in the voice of God speaking to Muhammad —
were just another author on the bestseller list .
Yet the fact that so few people do actually read the Koran is precisely why it &apos;s so easy to quote — that is , to misquote .
Phrases and snippets taken out of context in what I call the &quot; &quot; highlighter version , &quot; &quot; which is the one favored by both Muslim fundamentalists and anti-Muslim Islamophobes .
So this past spring , as I was gearing up to begin writing a biography of Muhammad , I realized I needed to read the Koran properly — as properly as I could , that is .
My Arabic &apos;s reduced by now to wielding a dictionary , so I took four well-known translations and decided to read them side-by-side , verse-by-verse along with a transliteration and the original seventh-century Arabic .
Now I did have an advantage .
My last book was about the story behind the Shi &apos;a-Sunni split , and for that I &apos;d worked closely with the earliest Islamic histories , so I knew the events to which the Koran constantly refers , its frame of reference .
I knew enough , that is , to know that I &apos;d be a tourist in the Koran — an informed one , an experienced one even , but still an outsider , an agnostic Jew reading some else &apos;s holy book .
( Laughter ) So I read slowly . ( Laughter )
I &apos;d set aside three weeks for this project , and that , I think , is what is meant by &quot; &quot; hubris &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — because it turned out to be three months .
I did resist the temptation to skip to the back where the shorter and more clearly mystical chapters are .
But every time I thought I was beginning to get a handle on the Koran — that feeling of &quot; &quot; I get it now &quot; &quot; — it would slip away overnight , and I &apos;d come back in the morning wondering if I wasn &apos;t lost in a strange land , and yet the terrain was very familiar .
The Koran declares that it comes to renew the message of the Torah and the Gospels .
So one-third of it reprises the stories of Biblical figures like Abraham , Moses , Joseph , Mary , Jesus .
God himself was utterly familiar from his earlier manifestation as Yahweh — jealously insisting on no other gods .
The presence of camels , mountains , desert wells and springs took me back to the year I spent wandering the Sinai Desert .
And then there was the language , the rhythmic cadence of it , reminding me of evenings spent listening to Bedouin elders recite hours-long narrative poems entirely from memory .
And I began to grasp why it &apos;s said that the Koran is really the Koran only in Arabic .
Take the Fatihah , the seven-verse opening chapter that is the Lord &apos;s Prayer and the Shema Yisrael of Islam combined .
It &apos;s just 29 words in Arabic , but anywhere from 65 to 72 in translation .
And yet the more you add , the more seems to go missing .
The Arabic has an incantatory , almost hypnotic , quality that begs to be heard rather than read , felt more than analyzed .
It wants to be chanted out loud , to sound its music in the ear and on the tongue .
So the Koran in English is a kind of shadow of itself , or as Arthur Arberry called his version , &quot; an interpretation . &quot;
But all is not lost in translation .
As the Koran promises , patience is rewarded , and there are many surprises — a degree of environmental awareness , for instance , and of humans as mere stewards of God &apos;s creation , unmatched in the Bible .
And where the Bible is addressed exclusively to men , using the second and third person masculine , the Koran includes women — talking , for instance , of believing men and believing women , honorable men and honorable women .
Or take the infamous verse about killing the unbelievers .
Yes , it does say that , but in a very specific context : the anticipated conquest of the sanctuary city of Mecca where fighting was usually forbidden , and the permission comes hedged about with qualifiers .
Not &quot; &quot; You must kill unbelievers in Mecca , &quot; &quot; but you can , you are allowed to , but only after a grace period is over and only if there &apos;s no other pact in place and only if they try to stop you getting to the Kaaba , and only if they attack you first .
And even then — God is merciful ; forgiveness is supreme — and so , essentially , better if you don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) This was perhaps the biggest surprise — how flexible the Koran is , at least in minds that are not fundamentally inflexible .
&quot; &quot; Some of these verses are definite in meaning , &quot; &quot; it says , &quot; and others are ambiguous . &quot;
The perverse at heart will seek out the ambiguities , trying to create discord by pinning down meanings of their own .
Only God knows the true meaning .
The phrase &quot; &quot; God is subtle &quot; &quot; appears again and again , and indeed , the whole of the Koran is far more subtle than most of us have been led to believe .
As in , for instance , that little matter of virgins and paradise .
Old-fashioned Orientalism comes into play here .
The word used four times is Houris , rendered as dark-eyed maidens with swelling breasts , or as fair , high-bosomed virgins .
Yet all there is in the original Arabic is that one word : Houris .
Not a swelling breast nor a high bosom in sight .
( Laughter ) Now this may be a way of saying &quot; &quot; pure beings &quot; &quot; — like in angels — or it may be like the Greek Kouros or Kórē , an eternal youth .
But the truth is nobody really knows , and that &apos;s the point .
Because the Koran is quite clear when it says that you &apos;ll be &quot; a new creation in paradise &quot; and that you will be &quot; &quot; recreated in a form unknown to you , &quot; &quot; which seems to me a far more appealing prospect than a virgin .
( Laughter ) And that number 72 never appears .
There are no 72 virgins in the Koran .
That idea only came into being 300 years later , and most Islamic scholars see it as the equivalent of people with wings sitting on clouds and strumming harps .
Paradise is quite the opposite .
It &apos;s not virginity ; it &apos;s fecundity .
It &apos;s plenty .
It &apos;s gardens watered by running streams .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Not yours , of course — other people &apos;s .
So I decided to try and write something more fun .
And I came up with an idea that I would write a cookbook .
Can anybody see anything but the left one being longer ?
If I cover the rest of the cube , you can see that they are identical .
Vision is one of the best things we do .
So I want to show you some cognitive illusions , or decision-making illusions , in the same way .
Germany is on the left , and Austria is on the right .
The Netherlands is on the left , and Belgium is on the right .
People don &apos;t check , and they don &apos;t join .
( Laughter ) Now , think about what this means .
All these medications , nothing seems to be working .
What do you do ? Do you pull the patient back and try ibuprofen ?
I &apos;ll give you a couple of more examples on irrational decision-making .
Now , weekend in Paris , weekend in Rome — these are different things .
If you want coffee , you have to pay for it yourself , it &apos;s two euros 50 .
This is why we have these four-minute dates .
I &apos;ll show you images here , no real people , but the experiment was with people .
I showed some people a picture of Tom , and a picture of Jerry .
and I said , &quot; &quot; Who do you want to date ?
And the question was , will ugly Jerry and ugly Tom help their respective , more attractive brothers ?
Now you get it .
&quot; What a piece of work is a man ! How noble in reason ! &quot;
Are we Superman , or are we Homer Simpson ?
( Applause )
I &apos;m a man who &apos;s trying to live from his heart , and so just before I get going , I wanted to tell you as a South African that one of the men who has inspired me most passed away a few hours ago .
Nelson Mandela has come to the end of his long walk to freedom .
And so this talk is going to be for him .
I grew up in wonder .
I grew up amongst those animals .
I grew up in the wild eastern part of South Africa at a place called Londolozi Game Reserve .
It &apos;s a place where my family has been in the safari business for four generations .
Now for as long as I can remember , my job has been to take people out into nature , and so I think it &apos;s a lovely twist of fate today to have the opportunity to bring some of my experiences out in nature in to this gathering .
Africa is a place where people still sit under starlit skies and around campfires and tell stories , and so what I have to share with you today is the simple medicine of a few campfire stories , stories about heroes of heart .
Now my stories are not the stories that you &apos;ll hear on the news , and while it &apos;s true that Africa is a harsh place , I also know it to be a place where people , animals and ecosystems teach us about a more interconnected world .
When I was nine years old , President Mandela came to stay with my family .
He had just been released from his 27 years of incarceration , and was in a period of readjustment to his sudden global icon status .
Members of the African National Congress thought that in the bush he would have time to rest and recuperate away from the public eye , and it &apos;s true that lions tend to be a very good deterrent to press and paparazzi .
( Laughter ) But it was a defining time for me as a young boy .
I would take him breakfast in bed , and then , in an old track suit and slippers , he would go for a walk around the garden .
At night , I would sit with my family around the snowy , bunny-eared TV , and watch images of that same quiet man from the garden surrounded by hundreds and thousands of people as scenes from his release were broadcast nightly .
He was bringing peace to a divided and violent South Africa , one man with an unbelievable sense of his humanity .
Mandela said often that the gift of prison was the ability to go within and to think , to create in himself the things he most wanted for South Africa : peace , reconciliation , harmony .
Through this act of immense open-heartedness , he was to become the embodiment of what in South Africa we call &quot; &quot; ubuntu . &quot; &quot; Ubuntu : I am because of you .
Or , people are not people without other people .
It &apos;s not a new idea or value but it &apos;s one that I certainly think at these times is worth building on .
In fact , it is said that in the collective consciousness of Africa , we get to experience the deepest parts of our own humanity through our interactions with others .
Ubuntu is at play right now .
You are holding a space for me to express the deepest truth of who I am .
Without you , I &apos;m just a guy talking to an empty room , and I spent a lot of time last week doing that , and it &apos;s not the same as this .
( Laughter ) If Mandela was the national and international embodiment , then the man who taught me the most about this value personally was this man , Solly Mhlongo .
Solly was born under a tree 60 kilometers from where I grew up in Mozambique .
He would never have a lot of money , but he was to be one of the richest men I would ever meet .
Solly grew up tending to his father &apos;s cattle .
Now , I can tell you , I don &apos;t know what it is about people who grow up looking after cattle , but it makes for über-resourcefulness .
The first job that he ever got in the safari business was fixing the safari trucks .
Where he had learned to do that out in the bush I have no idea , but he could do it .
He then moved across into what we called the habitat team .
These were the people on the reserve who were responsible for its well-being .
He fixed roads , he mended wetlands , he did some anti-poaching .
And then one day we were out together , and he came across the tracks of where a female leopard had walked .
And it was an old track , but for fun he turned and he began to follow it , and I tell you , I could tell by the speed at which he moved on those pad marks that this man was a Ph.D.-level tracker .
If you drove past Solly somewhere out on the reserve , you look up in your rearview mirror , you &apos;d see he &apos;d stopped the car 20 , 50 meters down the road just in case you need help with something .
The only accusation I ever heard leveled at him was when one of our clients said , &quot; Solly , you are pathologically helpful . &quot;
( Laughter ) When I started professionally guiding people out into this environment , Solly was my tracker .
We worked together as a team .
And the first guests we ever got were a philanthropy group from your East Coast , and they said to Solly , on the side , they said , &quot; &quot; Before we even go out to see lions and leopards , we want to see where you live . &quot; &quot; So we took them up to his house , and this visit of the philanthropist to his house coincided with a time when Solly &apos;s wife , who was learning English , was going through a phase where she would open the door by saying , &quot; &quot; Hello , I love you .
Welcome , I love you . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And there was something so beautifully African about it to me , this small house with a huge heart in it .
Now on the day that Solly saved my life , he was already my hero .
It was a hot day , and we found ourselves down by the river .
Because of the heat , I took my shoes off , and I rolled up my pants , and I walked into the water .
Solly remained on the bank .
The water was clear running over sand , and we turned and we began to make our way upstream .
And a few meters ahead of us , there was a place where a tree had fallen out of the bank , and its branches were touching the water , and it was shadowy .
And if had been a horror movie , people in the audience would have started saying , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t go in there . Don &apos;t go in there . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And of course , the crocodile was in the shadows .
Now the first thing that you notice when a crocodile hits you is the ferocity of the bite .
Wham ! It hits me by my right leg .
It pulls me . It turns . I throw my hand up . I &apos;m able to grab a branch .
It &apos;s shaking me violently .
It &apos;s a very strange sensation having another creature try and eat you , and there are few things that promote vegetarianism like that .
( Laughter ) Solly on the bank sees that I &apos;m in trouble .
He turns . He begins to make his way to me .
The croc again continues to shake me .
It goes to bite me a second time .
I notice a slick of blood in the water around me that gets washed downstream .
As it bites the second time , I kick .
My foot goes down its throat . It spits me out .
I pull myself up into the branches , and as I come out of the water , I look over my shoulder .
My leg from the knee down is mangled beyond description .
The bone is cracked .
The meat is torn up .
I make an instant decision that I &apos;ll never look at that again .
As I come out of the water , Solly arrives at a deep section , a channel between us .
He knows , he sees the state of my leg , he knows that between him and I there is a crocodile , and I can tell you this man doesn &apos;t slow down for one second .
He comes straight into the channel .
He wades in to above his waist .
He gets to me . He grabs me .
I &apos;m still in a vulnerable position .
He picks me and puts me on his shoulder .
This is the other thing about Solly , he &apos;s freakishly strong .
He turns . He walks me up the bank .
He lays me down . He pulls his shirt off .
He wraps it around my leg , picks me up a second time , walks me to a vehicle , and he &apos;s able to get me to medical attention .
And I survive .
Now — ( Applause ) Now I don &apos;t know how many people you know that go into a deep channel of water that they know has a crocodile in it to come and help you , but for Solly , it was as natural as breathing .
And he is one amazing example of what I have experienced all over Africa .
In a more collective society , we realize from the inside that our own well-being is deeply tied to the well-being of others .
Danger is shared . Pain is shared .
Joy is shared . Achievement is shared .
Houses are shared . Food is shared .
Ubuntu asks us to open our hearts and to share , and what Solly taught me that day is the essence of this value , his animated , empathetic action in every moment .
Now although the root word is about people , I thought that maybe ubuntu was only about people .
And then I met this young lady .
Her name was Elvis .
In fact , Solly gave her the name Elvis because he said she walked like she was doing the Elvis the pelvis dance .
She was born with very badly deformed back legs and pelvis .
She arrived at our reserve from a reserve east of us on her migratory route .
When I first saw her , I thought she would be dead in a matter of days .
And yet , for the next five years she returned in the winter months .
And we would be so excited to be out in the bush and to come across this unusual track .
It looked like an inverted bracket , and we would drop whatever we were doing and we would follow , and then we would come around the corner , and there she would be with her herd .
And that outpouring of emotion from people on our safari trucks as they saw her , it was this sense of kinship .
And it reminded me that even people who grow up in cities feel a natural connection with the natural world and with animals .
And yet still I remained amazed that she was surviving .
And then one day we came across them at this small water hole .
It was sort of a hollow in the ground .
And I watched as the matriarch drank , and then she turned in that beautiful slow motion of elephants , looks like the arm in motion , and she began to make her way up the steep bank .
The rest of the herd turned and began to follow .
And I watched young Elvis begin to psych herself up for the hill .
She got visibly — ears came forward , she had a full go of it and halfway up , her legs gave way , and she fell backwards .
She attempted it a second time , and again , halfway up , she fell backwards .
And on the third attempt , an amazing thing happened .
Halfway up the bank , a young teenage elephant came in behind her , and he propped his trunk underneath her , and he began to shovel her up the bank .
And it occurred to me that the rest of the herd was in fact looking after this young elephant .
The next day I watched again as the matriarch broke a branch and she would put it in her mouth , and then she would break a second one and drop it on the ground .
And a consensus developed between all of us who were guiding people in that area that that herd was in fact moving slower to accommodate that elephant .
What Elvis and the herd taught me caused me to expand my definition of ubuntu , and I believe that in the cathedral of the wild , we get to see the most beautiful parts of ourselves reflected back at us .
And it is not only through other people that we get to experience our humanity but through all the creatures that live on this planet .
If Africa has a gift to share , it &apos;s a gift of a more collective society .
And while it &apos;s true that ubuntu is an African idea , what I see is the essence of that value being invented here .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Pat Mitchell : So Boyd , we know that you knew President Mandela from early childhood and that you heard the news as we all did today , and deeply distraught and know the tragic loss that it is to the world .
But I just wondered if you wanted to share any additional thoughts , because we know that you heard that news just before coming in to do this session .
Boyd Varty : Well thanks , Pat .
I &apos;m so happy because it was time for him to pass on .
He was suffering .
And so of course there &apos;s the mixed emotions .
But I just think of so many occurrences like the time he went on the Oprah show and asked her what the show would be about .
( Laughter ) And she was like , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;ll be about you . &quot; &quot; I mean , that &apos;s just incredible humility . ( Laughter )
He was the father of our nation and we &apos;ve got a road to walk in South Africa .
And everything , they used to call it Madiba magic .
You know , he used to go to a rugby match and we would win .
Anywhere he went , things went well .
But I think that magic will be with us , and the important thing is that we carry what he stood for .
And so that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to try and do , and that &apos;s what people all over South Africa are trying to do .
PM : And that &apos;s what you &apos;ve done today . BV : Oh , thank you .
PM : Thank you . BV : Thank you . Thanks very much .
( Applause )
For that brief moment in time , the glow was brighter than all the stars in all the galaxies in all of the known Universe .
It was a very big bang .
But they didn &apos;t release their energy in light .
I mean , you know , they &apos;re black holes .
All that energy was pumped into the fabric of space and time itself , making the Universe explode in gravitational waves .
Let me give you a sense of the timescale at work here .
1.3 billion years ago , Earth had just managed to evolve multicellular life .
Since then , Earth has made and evolved corals , fish , plants , dinosaurs , people and even — God save us — the Internet .
And about 25 years ago , a particularly audacious set of people — Rai Weiss at MIT , Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever at Caltech — decided that it would be really neat to build a giant laser detector with which to search for the gravitational waves from things like colliding black holes .
Now , most people thought they were nuts .
But enough people realized that they were brilliant nuts that the US National Science Foundation decided to fund their crazy idea .
So after decades of development , construction and imagination and a breathtaking amount of hard work , they built their detector , called LIGO : The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory .
For the last several years , LIGO &apos;s been undergoing a huge expansion in its accuracy , a tremendous improvement in its detection ability .
It &apos;s now called Advanced LIGO as a result .
In early September of 2015 , LIGO turned on for a final test run while they sorted out a few lingering details .
And on September 14 of 2015 , just days after the detector had gone live , the gravitational waves from those colliding black holes passed through the Earth .
And they passed through you and me .
And they passed through the detector .
The other is when I had to say goodbye to my father when he was terminally ill .
You know , it was the payoff of my career , basically .
Everything I &apos;d been working on — it &apos;s no longer science fiction ! ( Laughs ) Allan Adams : So that &apos;s my very good friend and collaborator , Scott Hughes , a theoretical physicist at MIT , who has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and the signals that they could impart on observatories like LIGO , for the past 23 years .
So let me take a moment to tell you what I mean by a gravitational wave .
A gravitational wave is a ripple in the shape of space and time .
As the wave passes by , it stretches space and everything in it in one direction , and compresses it in the other .
This has led to countless instructors of general relativity doing a really silly dance to demonstrate in their classes on general relativity .
&quot; It stretches and expands , it stretches and expands . &quot;
So the trouble with gravitational waves is that they &apos;re very weak ; they &apos;re preposterously weak .
For example , the waves that hit us on September 14 — and yes , every single one of you stretched and compressed under the action of that wave — when the waves hit , they stretched the average person by one part in 10 to the 21 .
That &apos;s a decimal place , 20 zeroes , and a one .
That &apos;s why everyone thought the LIGO people were nuts .
So towards the end of his classic text on gravity , LIGO co-founder Kip Thorne described the hunt for gravitational waves as follows : He said , &quot; &quot; The technical difficulties to be surmounted in constructing such detectors are enormous .
But physicists are ingenious , and with the support of a broad lay public , all obstacles will surely be overcome . &quot; &quot; Thorne published that in 1973 , 42 years before he succeeded .
Now , coming back to LIGO , Scott likes to say that LIGO acts like an ear more than it does like an eye .
I want to explain what that means .
Visible light has a wavelength , a size , that &apos;s much smaller than the things around you , the features on people &apos;s faces , the size of your cell phone .
Sound is different .
Audible sound has a wavelength that can be up to 50 feet long .
And that makes it really difficult — in fact , in practical purposes , impossible — to make an image of something you really care about .
Your child &apos;s face .
That &apos;s Alice talking .
That &apos;s Bob interrupting .
Silly Bob .
So , the same is true of gravitational waves .
We can &apos;t use them to make simple images of things out in the Universe .
But by listening to changes in the amplitude and frequency of those waves , we can hear the story that those waves are telling .
And at least for LIGO , the frequencies that it can hear are in the audio band .
So if we convert the wave patterns into pressure waves and air , into sound , we can literally hear the Universe speaking to us .
For example , listening to gravity , just in this way , can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes , something my colleague Scott has spent an awful lot of time thinking about .
It &apos;s sort of the vocabulary of spin imprinted on this waveform .
AA : So on September 14 , 2015 , a date that &apos;s definitely going to live in my memory , LIGO heard this : &#91; Whirring sound &#93; So if you know how to listen , that is the sound of — ( Audio ) SH : ... two black holes , each of about 30 solar masses , that were whirling around at a rate comparable to what goes on in your blender .
AA : It &apos;s worth pausing here to think about what that means .
Two black holes , the densest thing in the Universe , one with a mass of 29 Suns and one with a mass of 36 Suns , whirling around each other 100 times per second before they collide .
Just imagine the power of that .
It &apos;s fantastic .
And we know it because we heard it .
That &apos;s the lasting importance of LIGO .
It &apos;s an entirely new way to observe the Universe that we &apos;ve never had before .
It &apos;s a way that lets us hear the Universe and hear the invisible .
And there &apos;s a lot out there that we can &apos;t see — in practice or even in principle .
So supernova , for example : I would love to know why very massive stars explode in supernovae .
They &apos;re very useful ; we &apos;ve learned a lot about the Universe from them .
The problem is , all the interesting physics happens in the core , and the core is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron and carbon and silicon .
Gravitational waves go through iron as if it were glass — totally transparent .
The Big Bang : I would love to be able to explore the first few moments of the Universe , but we &apos;ll never see them , because the Big Bang itself is obscured by its own afterglow .
With gravitational waves , we should be able to see all the way back to the beginning .
Perhaps most importantly , I &apos;m positive that there are things out there that we &apos;ve never seen that we may never be able to see and that we haven &apos;t even imagined — things that we &apos;ll only discover by listening .
So it lets us really get a whole nother angle on what &apos;s out there in the Universe and how the stars came to be , and in the end , of course , how we came to be out of this whole mess .
AA : Our challenge now is to be as audacious as possible .
Our job is to dream up and build new observatories — a whole new generation of observatories — on the ground , in space .
I mean , what could be more glorious than listening to the Big Bang itself ?
Our job now is to dream big .
Dream with us .
Thank you .
Sixty-five million years ago , a very important and catastrophic event changed the course of life on land .
And although we know that the land animals I &apos;m going to talk about are just the scum of the Earth on the land — the little bits of land floating around — but they are important to us because they &apos;re sort of in our scale of experience from millimeters to meters .
And these animals disappeared , and a separate life , mammals , radiated out to take their place . And so , we know this in extraordinary detail . And so this is a core from near Bermuda . We know that the tsunamis , the earthquakes , and the things that we &apos;ve experienced in the entire record of humankind history can &apos;t really quite get around the kind of disaster that this represented for the Earth .
So even before that impact was known , even before scientists in general came to an agreement over the theory of evolution , scientists and natural historians of all kinds of stripes actually had divided Earth &apos;s life &apos;s history into these two episodes : Mesozoic , the middle life , and the Cenozoic , the recent life .
And as it turns out , it actually corresponds really nicely with geologic history .
So we have a Mesozoic period , an age of fragmentation , and a Cenozoic period , an age of reconnection — South America to North America , India to Asia .
And so my work , really , is trying to understand the character of that Mesozoic radiation compared to the Cenozoic radiation to see what mysteries we can understand from dinosaurs and from other animals about what life on drifting continents really can tell us about evolution .
The work immediately begs the question , &quot; Why didn &apos;t they go into the waters ? &quot;
I mean , certainly mammals did . This is one example .
You can go outside — see many other examples .
Within five , 10 million years of the bolide impact we had a whole variety of animals going into the water . Why didn &apos;t they do that ?
Why didn &apos;t they hang around in trees at good size , and why didn &apos;t they burrow ?
Why didn &apos;t they do all these things , and if they didn &apos;t do all these things , what kinds of animals were in those spaces ?
And if there were no animals in those spaces , what does that tell us about , you know , how evolution works on land ?
Really interesting questions . I think a lot of it has to do with body size .
In fact , I think that most of it has to do with body size — the size you are when you inherit a vacant ecospace from whatever natural disaster .
Looking at dinosaur evolution and studying it , digging it up for many years , I end up looking at the mammal radiation , and it seems as though everything is quick time , just like technology , advancing by an order of magnitude .
Dinosaur evolution proceeded at a stately pace , an order of magnitude slower on any way you want to measure it .
You want to measure it by diversity ? You want to measure it by
the time it took to reach maximum body size ?
Yes , they do have larger body size , but many of them are smaller , but we &apos;re interested in the time it took them to achieve that .
Fifty million years to achieve this maximum body size .
And that is 10 times longer than it took the mammals to achieve maximum body size and invade all those habitats .
So there &apos;s lessons to learn , and there &apos;s lessons to learn from the exception , the exception that we know very well today from the discoveries we &apos;ve made , and many other scholars have made around the world .
This slide was shown before . This is the famous Jurassic bird Archaeopteryx .
We now know this transition is the one time that dinosaurs actually went below that body size — we &apos;re going to see where they began in a minute — and it is the one time that they rapidly invaded all the habitats I just told you that dinosaurs weren &apos;t in .
They became marine . We now know them today from the ice caps .
There &apos;s burrowing birds .
They inhabit the trees at all body sizes , and , of course , they inhabit the land .
So we were the first to actually name a bird from the famous series that later exploded onto the pages of Science and Nature .
We called this bird Sinornis . It &apos;s a little bit more advanced than Archaeopteryx , and if you go to different layers , you find things that are less advanced than Archaeopteryx , and every grade in between , so that if you find something today , we &apos;re usually splitting hairs — or , more appropriately , feathers — as to decide whether it &apos;s actually a non-avian or an avian .
It is the greatest transition that we have , actually , on land from one habitat to another , bar none , to understand how a bony , fairly heavy , kilogram or a couple-of-kilogram animal could make such a transition .
It is really our greatest — one of our greatest — evolutionary sequences .
Now , my work began at the beginning .
I thought if I &apos;m going to understand dinosaur evolution , I &apos;d have to go back to those beds where they had picked up fragments , go back to a time and a place where the earliest dinosaurs existed .
I &apos;d like to call for this little video clip to give you some idea of , sort of , what we face . Normally , we get asked a lot of questions : &quot; Well , how do you find fossils in areas that look like this ? &quot;
If we could roll that first video clip .
This is sort of a nice helicopter ride through those early beds , and they &apos;re located in Northeastern Argentina .
And we &apos;re coming over a cliff , and at the top of that cliff , dinosaurs had basically taken over .
At the bottom of the cliff , we find that they &apos;re rare as hens &apos; teeth .
That &apos;s where dinosaur origins is to be found : at the bottom of the cliff .
You go into an area like this , you get a geologic map , you get a topographic map , and the best , most-inspired team you can bring to the area .
And the rest is up to you . You &apos;ve got to find fossils .
You &apos;ve got to dig a hole that &apos;s usually quite a bit bigger than that to get it out ; you &apos;ve got to climb those cliffs and find , really , everything that existed — not just the dinosaurs , but the entire story . If you &apos;re lucky , and you dig a place like that , you actually find the ash bed to dig it , and we did .
228 million years old , we found what really is the most primitive dinosaur : that &apos;s the Ur-dinosaur .
A three-and-a-half foot thing , beautiful skull , predator , meat-eater , a two-legged animal .
So , all the other dinosaurs that you know , or your kids know , at least , on four legs .
This is sort of a look at the skull , and it &apos;s an absolutely fantastic thing about five or six inches long .
It looks rather bird-like because it is .
It &apos;s bird-like and hollow .
A predator . Maybe 25 pounds , or 10 kilograms .
That &apos;s where dinosaurs began . That &apos;s where the radiation began .
That is 10 times larger than the mammal radiation , which was a four-legged radiation .
We are extremely dinosaur-like , and unusual in our two-legged approach to life .
Now , if you want to understand what happened then when the continents broke apart , and dinosaurs found — landlubbers , as they are — found themselves adrift . There &apos;s some missing puzzle pieces .
Most of those missing puzzle pieces are southern continents , because it was those continents that are least explored .
If you want to add to this picture and try and sketch it globally , you really have to force yourself to go down to the four corners of the Earth — Africa , India , Antarctica , Australia — and start putting together some of these pieces .
I &apos;ve been to some of those continents , but Africa was , in the words of Steven Pinker , was a blank slate , largely .
But one with an immense chalkboard in the middle , with lots of little areas of dinosaur rock if you could survive an expedition .
There &apos;s no roads into the Sahara . It &apos;s an enormous place .
To be able to excavate the 80 tons of dinosaurs that we have in the Sahara and take them out , you really have to put together an expedition team that can handle the conditions .
Some of them are political . Many of them are physical .
Some of them — the most important — are mental .
And you really have to be able to withstand conditions — you have to drive into the desert , you will see landscapes in many cases — you can see from what we &apos;ve discovered — that nobody else has ever seen .
And the kinds of teams they bring in ?
Well , they &apos;re composed of people who understand science as adventure with a purpose .
They &apos;re usually students who &apos;ve never seen a desert .
Some of them are more experienced .
Your job as a leader — this is definitely a team sport — your job as a leader is to try to inspire them to do more work than they &apos;ve ever done in their life under conditions that they can &apos;t imagine .
So , 125 degrees is normal .
The ground surface at 150 — typical .
So , you can &apos;t leave your normal metal tools out because you &apos;ll get a first-degree burn if you grab them sometimes .
So , you are finding yourself also in an amazing cultural milieu .
You &apos;re really rubbing shoulders with the world &apos;s last great nomadic people .
These are the Tuareg nomads , and they &apos;re living their lives much as they have for centuries .
Your job is to excavate things like this in the foreground , and make them enter the pages of history .
To do that , you &apos;ve got to actually transport them thousands of miles out of the desert .
We &apos;re talking about Ethiopia , but let &apos;s talk about Niger — or Niger , in our English language — north of Nigeria — that &apos;s where this photograph was taken .
Basically you &apos;re talking about a country that , when we started working there , did not have container traffic .
You transported the bones out yourself to the coast of Africa , onto a boat , if you wanted to get them out of the middle of the Sahara .
That &apos;s a 2,000 mile journey .
So enormous excavations and a lot of work , and out of essentially a partial herd of dinosaurs that you saw buried there — 20 tons of material — we erect Jobaria , a sauropod dinosaur like we haven &apos;t seen on some other continents .
It really is a little bit out of place temporally .
It looks nothing like what we would find if we dug in contemporary beds in North America .
Here &apos;s the animal that was causing it trouble .
And , you know , on and on — a whole menagerie . When you pick up something like this — and some of you have had the chance to touch it — this is a piece of history . You &apos;re touching something that &apos;s 110 million years old .
This is a thumb claw . There it was , moments after it was discovered .
It is an incredible view of life , and it really began when we began to understand the depth of time .
It &apos;s only been with us for less than a century , and in that time , that fourth dimension , when radioactive dating came about , less than a century ago , and we could actually tell how old some of these things were , is probably the most profound transformation , because it changes the way we look at ourselves and the world dramatically .
When you pick up a piece of history like that , I think it can transform kids that are possibly interested in science .
That &apos;s the animal that thumb claw came from : Suchomimus .
Here &apos;s some others .
This is something we found in Morocco , an immense animal .
We prototyped by CAT-scanning the brain out of this animal .
It turns out to have a forebrain one-fifteenth the size of a human .
This was the cover of Science , because they thought that humans were more intelligent than these animals , but we can see by some in our administration that despite the enormous advantage in brain volume some of the attitudes remain the same . Anyway , smaller raptors .
All the stuff from Jurassic Park that you know of — all those small animals — they all come from northern continents .
This is the first skeleton from a southern continent , and guess what ? You start preparing it .
It has no big claw on its hind foot . It doesn &apos;t look like a Velociraptor .
It &apos;s really a wholly separate radiation .
So what we &apos;re trying to piece together here is a story .
It involves flying reptiles like this Pterosaur that we reconstructed from Africa .
Crocodiles , of course , and that &apos;s a nasty one we haven &apos;t named yet .
And huge things — I mean , this is a lower jaw just laying there in the desert of this enormous crocodile .
The crocodile is technically called Sarcosuchus .
That &apos;s an adult Orinoco crocodile in its jaws .
We had to try and reconstruct this .
We had to actually look at recent crocodiles to understand how crocodiles scale .
Could I have the second little video clip ?
Now , this field is just — and , of course , science in general — is just — adventure .
We had to find and measure the largest crocodiles living today .
Narrator : ... as long as their boat .
Man : Look at that set of choppers ! Yeah , he &apos;s a big one .
Narrator : If they can just land it , this croc will provide useful data , helping Paul in his quest to understand Sarcosuchus .
Man : OK , hand me some more here . Man 2 : OK .
Narrator : It falls to Paul to cover its eyes .
Man : Watch out ! Watch out ! No , no , no , no . You &apos;re going to have to get on the back legs .
Man : I got the back legs .
Man 2 : You have the back legs ? No , you have the front legs , my friend .
I &apos;ve got it . I &apos;ve got the back legs .
Somebody get the front legs .
Paul Sereno : Let &apos;s get this tape measure on him . Put it right there .
Wow .
Sixty-five . Wow .
That &apos;s a big skull .
Narrator : Big , but less than half the size of supercroc &apos;s skull .
Man : Enormous . PS : You &apos;ve got a ... 14-foot croc .
Man : I knew it was big .
PS : Don &apos;t get off . You don &apos;t get off , but don &apos;t worry about me .
Narrator : Paul has his data , so they decide to release the animal back into the river .
PS : Don &apos;t get off ! Don &apos;t get off ! Don &apos;t get off !
Narrator : Paul has never seen a fossil do that .
PS : Okay , when I say three , we move .
One , two , three !
Whoa !
So — there were — ( Applause ) Well , you know , the — the fossil record is truly amazing because it really forces you to look at living animals in a new way .
We proved with those measurements that crocodiles scaled isometrically .
It depended on the shape of their skull , though , so we had to actually get those measurements to be sure that we had reconstructed and could prove to the scientific world that supercroc in fact is a 40-foot crocodile , probably a male .
Anyway , you find other things , too .
I &apos;m going to lead an expedition to the Sahara to dig up Africa &apos;s largest neolithic site .
We found this last year .
Two hundred skeletons , tools , jewelry .
This is a ceremonial disk .
An amazing record of the colonization of the Sahara 5,000 years ago is been sitting out there waiting for us to go back . So , really exciting .
And then work later is going to take us to Tibet .
Now , we normally think of Tibet as a highland .
It &apos;s really an island continent .
It was a precursor to India , a messenger from Gondwana — a lost paradise of dinosaurs isolated for millions of years .
No one &apos;s found them . We know where they are , and we &apos;re going to go and get them next year .
They &apos;re only between 13 and 14,000 feet , but if you go in the warm part of the year , it &apos;s O.K.
Now , I tried to suture together a dinosaur evolutionary history so that we can try to understand some basic patterns of evolution .
I &apos;ve talked about a few of them . We really need to take that further .
We need to delve into this mass of anatomy that we &apos;ve been compiling to understand where the changes are occurring and what this means .
We can &apos;t predict , necessarily , what will happen in evolution , but we can learn some of the rules of the game , and that &apos;s really what we &apos;re trying to do .
With regard to the biogeographic question , the Earth is dividing .
These are all landlubbing animals . There &apos;s a couple of choices .
You get divided , and a continent &apos;s division corresponds to a fork in the evolutionary tree , or you &apos;re crafty , and you manage to escape from one to the other and erase that division , or you &apos;re living peacefully on each side , and on one side you just go extinct , and you survive on the other side and create a difference .
And the fourth thing is that you actually did one or the other of those three things , but the paleontologist never found you .
And you take those four instances and you realize you have a complex problem .
And so , in addition to digging , I think we have some answers from the dinosaur record . I think these dinosaurs migrated — we call it dispersal — around the globe , with the slightest land bridge .
They did it within two or three degrees of the pole , to maintain similarity between continents .
But when they were divided , indeed they were divided , and we do see the continents carving differences among dinosaurs .
But there &apos;s one thing that &apos;s even more important , and I think that &apos;s extinction .
We have downgraded this factor .
It carves up the history of life , and gives us the differences that we see in the dinosaur world towards the end , right before the bolide impact .
The best way to test this is to actually create a model .
So if we move back , this is a two-dimensional typical tree of life .
I want to give you three dimensions .
So you see the tree of life , but now I &apos;ve added the dimension of area .
So the tree of life is normally divergence over time .
Now we have divergence over time , but we &apos;ve created the third dimension of area .
This is a computer program which has three knobs .
We can control those things that we &apos;re worried about : extinction , sampling , dispersal — going from one area to another .
And ultimately we can control the branching to mimic what we think the continents were like , and run it a thousand times , so we can estimate the parameters , to answer the question whether we are on the mark or not , at least to know the barriers of the problems . So that &apos;s a little bit about the science .
Today I &apos;m going to spend the rest of my few minutes up here talking about the other stuff that I do in Chicago , which is related to the fact that I never — and actually , in talking to a lot of TEDsters , there &apos;s a number of you out there — I don &apos;t know that I &apos;d get an answer honestly , if I asked you to raise your hand , but there are a number of you out there that started your scientific , technical , entertainment career as failures , by society &apos;s standards , as failures by schools .
I was one of those . I was failed by my school — my school failed me .
Who &apos;s pointing fingers ?
Several teachers nearly killed me .
I found myself in art .
I was a total failure in school , not really headed to graduate high school .
And I went on — that &apos;s my first painting on canvas .
I read a dictionary . I got into college .
I became an artist . O.K. , and started drawing .
It became abstract .
I worked up a portfolio , and I was headed to New York .
Sometimes I would see bones when there was a body there .
Something was going on in the background . I headed to New York to a studio .
I took a side trip to the American Museum , and I never recovered .
But really it &apos;s the same discipline — they &apos;re kindred disciplines .
I mean , is there anything that is not visualizing what can &apos;t be seen , in terms of discovering this dinosaur bone from a small piece of it that &apos;s out there , or seeing the distortion that we try to see as evolutionary distortion in one animal to another ?
This is a very extraordinarily visual .
I give you a human face because you &apos;re experts at that .
It takes us years to understand how to do that with dinosaurs .
They &apos;re really kindred disciplines .
But what we &apos;re trying to create in Chicago is a way to get , collect together , those students who are least represented in our science and technology spheres .
We all know , and there &apos;s been several allusions to it , that we are failing in our ability to produce enough scientists , engineers and technicians .
We &apos;ve known that for a long time . We &apos;ve gone through the Sputnik phase , and now , as you see the increase in the pace of what we &apos;re doing , it becomes even more prominent . Where are all these people going to come from ?
And a more general question for our society is , what &apos;s going to happen to all the rest that are left behind ?
What about all the kids like me that were in school — kids like some of you out there — that were in school and didn &apos;t get a chance and will never get a chance to participate in science and technology ?
Those are the questions I ask . And we talk about Ethiopia , and it &apos;s very important .
Niger is equally important , and I &apos;m trying desperately to do something in Niger .
They have an AIDS problem . I asked — the U.S. State Department asked the government recently , What do you want to do ? And they gave them two problems .
Dinosaurs was one of them .
Give us a museum of dinosaurs , and we will attract tourists , which is our number two industry .
And I hope to God the United States government , me , or TED , or somebody helps us do that , because that would be an incredible thing for their country .
But when we look back at our own country , we &apos;re looking back at our cities , the cities where most of you come from — certainly the city I come from — there &apos;s legions of kids out there like these .
And the question is — and we started to address this question for centuries — as to how we get these kids involved in science .
We &apos;ve started in Chicago an organization — a non-profit organization — called Project Exploration .
These are two kids from Project Exploration .
We met them in their early stages in high school . They were — failing to poor students , and they are now — one at the University of Chicago , another in Illinois .
We &apos;ve got students at Harvard . We &apos;re six years old .
And we created a track record .
Because when you go out there as a scholar , and you try to find out longitudinal studies , track records like that , there essentially are very few , if none .
So , we &apos;ve created an incredible track record of 100 percent graduation , 90 percent going to college , many first-generation , 90 percent of those choosing science as a career .
It &apos;s an impressive track record , and so we look back and we say , well , we didn &apos;t really exactly work this out theoretically from the start , but when we look back , there are theoretical movements in science education .
It &apos;s gone through science as an inquiry , which was a big advance , and Dewey back at Chicago — you learn by doing .
To — you learn by envisioning yourself as a scientist , and then you learn to envision yourself as a scientist .
The next step is to learn the capability to make yourself a scientist .
You have to have those steps . If you have — It &apos;s easy to get kids interested in science .
It &apos;s hard to get them to envision themselves as a scientist , which involves standing up in front of people like we &apos;re doing here at this symposium and presenting something as a knowledgeable person , and then seeing yourself in the role as a scientist and giving yourself the tools to pursue that .
And so , that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do . We &apos;re planning a permanent home in Chicago .
We have lots of ideas , but I guarantee you this one thing — and I &apos;ve talked to some people here at TED — it &apos;s not going to look like anything you &apos;ve seen before .
It &apos;s going to be part-school , part-museum hall , part-conservatory , part-zoo , and part of an answer to the problem of how you interest kids in science .
Thank you very much .
I have 18 minutes to tell you what happened over the past six million years .
All right .
We all have come from a long way , here in Africa , and converged in this region of Africa , which is a place where 90 percent of our evolutionary process took place .
And I say that not because I am African , but it &apos;s in Africa that you find the earliest evidence for human ancestors , upright walking traces , even the first technologies in the form of stone tools .
So we all are Africans , and welcome home .
All right .
I &apos;m a paleoanthropologist , and my job is to define man &apos;s place in nature and explore what makes us human .
And today , I will use Selam , the earliest child ever discovered , to tell you a story of all of us .
Selam is our most complete skeleton of a three-year-old girl who lived and died 3.3 million years ago .
She belongs to the species known as Australopithecus afarensis .
You don &apos;t need to remember that .
That &apos;s the Lucy species , and was found by my research team in December of 2000 in an area called Dikika .
It &apos;s in the northeastern part of Ethiopia .
And Selam means peace in many Ethiopian languages .
We use that name to celebrate peace in the region and in the planet .
And the fact that it was the cover story of all these famous magazines gives you already an idea of her significance , I think .
After I was invited by TED , I did some digging , because that &apos;s what we do , to know about my host .
You don &apos;t just jump into an invitation .
And I learned that the first technology appeared in the form of stone tools , 2.6 million years ago .
First entertainment comes evidence from flutes that are 35,000 years old .
And evidence for first design comes 75,000 years old — beads .
And you can do the same with your genes and track them back in time .
And DNA analysis of living humans and chimpanzees teaches us today that we diverged sometime around seven million years ago and that these two species share over 98 percent of the same genetic material .
I think knowing this is a very useful context within which we can think of our ancestry .
However , DNA analysis informs us only about the beginning and the end , telling us nothing about what happened in the middle .
So , for us , paleoanthropologists , our job is to find the hard evidence , the fossil evidence , to fill in this gap and see the different stages of development .
Because it &apos;s only when you do that , that you can talk about — ( Laughter ) — it &apos;s only when you do that , &#91; that &#93; you can talk about how we looked like and how we behaved at different times , and how those likes and looks and behaviors changed through time .
That then gives you an access to explore the biological mechanisms and forces that are responsible for this gradual change that made us what we are today .
But finding the hard evidence is a very complicated endeavor .
It &apos;s a systematic and scientific approach , which takes you to places that are remote , hot , hostile and often with no access .
Just to give you an example , when I went to Dikika , where Selam was found , in &apos; 99 — and it &apos;s about 500 kilometers from Addis Ababa , the capital of Ethiopia .
It took us only seven hours to do the first 470 kilometers of the 500 , but took four , solid hours to do the last only 30 kilometers .
With the help of the locals and using just shovels and picks , I made my way .
I was the first person to actually drive a car to the spot .
When you get there , this is what you see , and it &apos;s the vastness of the place which makes you feel helpless and vulnerable .
And once you make it there , the big question is where to start .
( Laughter ) And you find nothing for years and years .
When I go to places like this , which are paleontological sites , it &apos;s like going to a game park , an extinct game park .
But what you find are not the human remains , such as Selam and Lucy , on a day-to-day basis .
You find elephants , rhinos , monkeys , pigs , etc .
But you could ask , how could these large mammals live in this desert environment ?
Of course , they cannot , but I &apos;m telling you already that the environment and the carrying capacity of this region was drastically different from what we have today .
A very important environmental lesson could be learned from this .
Anyway , once we made it there , then it &apos;s a game park , as I said , an extinct game park .
And our ancestors lived in that game park , but were just the minorities . They were not as successful and as widespread as the Homo sapiens that we are .
To tell you just an example , an anecdote about their rarity , I was going to this place every year and would do fieldwork here , and the assistants , of course , helped me do the surveys .
They would find a bone and tell me , &quot; &quot; Here is what you &apos;re looking for . &quot; &quot; I would say , &quot; &quot; No , that &apos;s an elephant . &quot; &quot; Again , another one , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a monkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a pig , &quot; &quot; etc .
So one of my assistants , who never went to school , said to me , &quot; &quot; Listen , Zeray .
You either don &apos;t know what you &apos;re looking for , or you &apos;re looking in the wrong place , &quot; &quot; he said .
( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Because there were elephants and lions , and the people were scared and went somewhere else .
Let &apos;s go somewhere else . &quot; &quot; Well , he was very tired , and it &apos;s really tiring .
It was then , after such hard work and many frustrating years that we found Selam , and you see the face here covered by sandstone .
And here is actually the spinal column and the whole torso encased in a sandstone block , because she was buried by a river .
What you have here seems to be nothing , but contains an incredible amount of scientific information that helps us explore what makes us human .
This is the earliest and most complete juvenile human ancestor ever found in the history of paleoanthropology , an amazing piece of our long , long history .
There were these three people and me , and I am taking the pictures , that &apos;s why I am not in .
How would you feel if you were me ? You have something extraordinary in your hand , but you are in the middle of nowhere ?
The feeling I had was a deep and quiet happiness and excitement , of course accompanied by a huge sense of responsibility , of making sure everything is safe .
Here is a close-up of the fossil , after five years of cleaning , preparation and description , which was very long , as I had to expose the bones from the sandstone block I just showed you in the previous slide .
It took five years .
In a way , this was like the second birth for the child , after 3.3 million years , but the labor was very long .
And here is full scale — it &apos;s a tiny bone .
And in the middle is the minister of Ethiopian tourism , who came to visit the National Museum of Ethiopia while I was working there .
And you see me worried and trying to protect my child , because you don &apos;t leave anyone with this kind of child , even a minister .
So then , once you &apos;ve done that , the next stage is to know what it is .
( Laughter ) Once that was done , then it was possible to compare .
We were able to tell that she belonged to the human family tree because the legs , the foot , and some features clearly showed that she walked upright , and upright walking is a hallmark in humanity .
But in addition , if you compare the skull with a comparably aged chimpanzee and little George Bush here , you see that you have vertical forehead .
And you see that in humans , because of the development of the pre-frontal cortex , it &apos;s called .
You don &apos;t see that in chimpanzees , and you don &apos;t see this very projecting canine .
So she belongs to our family tree , but within that , of course , you do detailed analysis , and we know now that she belongs to the Lucy species , known as Australopithecus afarensis .
The next exciting question is , girl or boy ?
And how old was she when she died ?
You can determine the sex of the individual based on the size of the teeth .
How ?
You know , in primates , there is this phenomenon called sexual dimorphism , which simply means males are larger than females and males have larger teeth than the females .
But to do that , you need the permanent dentition , which you don &apos;t see here , because what you have here are the baby teeth .
But using the CT scanning technology , which is normally used for medical purposes , you can go deep into the mouth and come up with this beautiful image showing you both the baby teeth here and the still-growing adult teeth here .
So when you measure those teeth , it was clear that she turned out to be a girl with very small canine teeth .
And to know how old she was when she died , what you do is you do an informed estimate , and you say , how much time would be required to form this amount of teeth , and the answer was three .
So , this girl died when she was about three , 3.3 million years ago .
So , with all that information , the big question is — what do we actually — what does she tell us ?
To answer this question , we can phrase another question .
What do we actually know about our ancestors ?
We want to know how they looked like , how they behaved , how they walked around , and how they lived and grew up .
And among the answers that you can get from this skeleton are included : first , this skeleton documents , for the first time , how infants looked over three million years ago .
And second , she tells us that she walked upright , but had some adaptation for tree climbing .
And more interesting , however , is the brain in this child was still growing .
At age three , if you have a still-growing brain , it &apos;s a human behavior .
In chimps , by age three , the brain is formed over 90 percent .
That &apos;s why they can cope with their environment very easily after birth — faster than us , anyway .
But in humans , we continue to grow our brains .
That &apos;s why we need care from our parents .
But that care means also you learn .
You spend more time with your parents .
And that &apos;s very characteristic of humans and it &apos;s called childhood , which is this extended dependence of human children on their family or parents .
So , the still-growing brain in this individual tells us that childhood , which requires an incredible social organization , a very complex social organization , emerged over three million years ago .
So , by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history , Selam unites us all and gives us a unique account on what makes us human .
But not everything was human , and I will give you a very exciting example .
This is called the hyoid bone . It &apos;s a bone which is right here .
It supports your tongue from behind .
It &apos;s , in a way , your voice box .
It determines the type of voice you produce .
It was not known in the fossil record , and we have it in this skeleton .
When we did the analysis of this bone , it was clear that it looked very chimp-like , chimpanzee-like .
So if you were there 3.3 million years ago , to hear when this girl was crying out for her mother , she would have sounded more like a chimpanzee than a human .
Maybe you &apos;re wondering , &quot; &quot; So , you see this ape feature , human feature , ape feature .
What does that tell us ? &quot; &quot; You know , that is very exciting for us , because it demonstrates that things were changing slowly and progressively , and that evolution is in the making .
To summarize the significance of this fossil , we can say the following .
Up to now , the knowledge that we had about our ancestors came essentially from adult individuals because the fossils , the baby fossils , were missing .
They don &apos;t preserve well , as you know .
So the knowledge that we had about our ancestors , on how they looked like , how they behaved , was kind of biased toward adults .
Imagine somebody coming from Mars and his job is to report on the type of people occupying our planet Earth , and you hide all the babies , the children , and he goes back and reports .
Can you imagine how much biased his report would be ?
That &apos;s what somehow we were doing so far in the absence of the fossil children , so I think the new fossil fixes this problem .
So , I think the most important question at the end is , what do we actually learn from specimens like this and from our past in general ?
Of course , in addition to extracting this huge amount of scientific information as to what makes us human , you know , the many human ancestors that have existed over the past six million years — and there are more than 10 — they did not have the knowledge , the technology and sophistications that we , Homo sapiens , have today .
But if this species , ancient species , would travel in time and see us today , they would very much be very proud of their legacy , because they became the ancestors of the most successful species in the universe .
And they were probably not aware of this future legacy , but they did great .
Now the question is , we Homo sapiens today are in a position to decide about the future of our planet , possibly more .
So the question is , are we up to the challenge ?
And can we really do better than these primitive , small-brained ancestors ?
Among the most pressing challenges that our species is faced with today are the chronic problems of Africa .
Needless to list them here , and there are more competent people to talk about this .
Still , in my opinion , we have two choices .
One is to continue to see a poor , ill , crying Africa , carrying guns , that depends on other people forever , or to promote an Africa which is confident , peaceful , independent , but cognizant of its huge problems and great values at the same time .
I am for the second option , and I &apos;m sure many of you are .
And the key is to promote a positive African attitude towards Africa .
That &apos;s because we Africans concentrate — I am from Ethiopia , by the way — we concentrate too much on how we are seen from elsewhere , or from outside .
I think it &apos;s important to promote in a more positive way on how we see ourselves .
That &apos;s what I call positive African attitude .
So finally , I would like to say , so let &apos;s help Africa walk upright and forward , then we all can be proud of our future legacy as a species .
Thank you .

I recently retired from the California Highway Patrol after 23 years of service .
The majority of those 23 years was spent patrolling the southern end of Marin County , which includes the Golden Gate Bridge .
Unfortunately , it is also a magnet for suicide , being one of the most utilized sites in the world .
The Golden Gate Bridge opened in 1937 .
Joseph Strauss , chief engineer in charge of building the bridge , was quoted as saying , &quot; &quot; The bridge is practically suicide-proof .
Suicide from the bridge is neither practical nor probable . &quot; &quot; But since its opening , over 1,600 people have leapt to their death from that bridge .
Some believe that traveling between the two towers will lead you to another dimension — this bridge has been romanticized as such — that the fall from that frees you from all your worries and grief , and the waters below will cleanse your soul .
But let me tell you what actually occurs when the bridge is used as a means of suicide .
After a free fall of four to five seconds , the body strikes the water at about 75 miles an hour .
That impact shatters bones , some of which then puncture vital organs .
Most die on impact .
Those that don &apos;t generally flail in the water helplessly , and then drown .
I don &apos;t think that those who contemplate this method of suicide realize how grisly a death that they will face .
This is the cord .
Except for around the two towers , there is 32 inches of steel paralleling the bridge .
This is where most folks stand before taking their lives .
I can tell you from experience that once the person is on that cord , and at their darkest time , it is very difficult to bring them back .
I took this photo last year as this young woman spoke to an officer contemplating her life .
I want to tell you very happily that we were successful that day in getting her back over the rail .
When I first began working on the bridge , we had no formal training .
You struggled to funnel your way through these calls .
This was not only a disservice to those contemplating suicide , but to the officers as well .
We &apos;ve come a long , long way since then .
Now , veteran officers and psychologists train new officers .
This is Jason Garber .
I responded , and when I arrived , I observed Jason speaking to a Golden Gate Bridge officer .
Jason was just 32 years old and had flown out here from New Jersey .
As a matter of fact , he had flown out here on two other occasions from New Jersey to attempt suicide on this bridge .
After about an hour of speaking with Jason , he asked us if we knew the story of Pandora &apos;s box .
Recalling your Greek mythology , Zeus created Pandora , and sent her down to Earth with a box , and told her , &quot; &quot; Never , ever open that box . &quot; &quot; Well one day , curiosity got the better of Pandora , and she did open the box .
Out flew plagues , sorrows , and all sorts of evils against man .
The only good thing in the box was hope .
Jason then asked us , &quot; &quot; What happens when you open the box and hope isn &apos;t there ? &quot; &quot; He paused a few moments , leaned to his right , and was gone .
This kind , intelligent young man from New Jersey had just committed suicide .
I spoke with Jason &apos;s parents that evening , and I suppose that , when I was speaking with them , that I didn &apos;t sound as if I was doing very well , because that very next day , their family rabbi called to check on me .
Jason &apos;s parents had asked him to do so .
The collateral damage of suicide affects so many people .
I pose these questions to you : What would you do if your family member , friend or loved one was suicidal ?
What would you say ?
Would you know what to say ?
In my experience , it &apos;s not just the talking that you do , but the listening .
Listen to understand .
Don &apos;t argue , blame , or tell the person you know how they feel , because you probably don &apos;t .
By just being there , you may just be the turning point that they need .
If you think someone is suicidal , don &apos;t be afraid to confront them and ask the question .
One way of asking them the question is like this : &quot; &quot; Others in similar circumstances have thought about ending their life ; have you had these thoughts ? &quot; &quot; Confronting the person head-on may just save their life and be the turning point for them .
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago , and I received an email from a lady that I &apos;d like to read you her letter .
&quot; &quot; Hi , Kevin . I imagine you &apos;re at the TED Conference .
That must be quite the experience to be there .
I &apos;m thinking I should go walk the bridge this weekend .
Just wanted to drop you a note .
Hope you get the word out to many people and they go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends , etc .
I &apos;m still pretty numb , but noticing more moments of really realizing Mike isn &apos;t coming home .
Mike was driving from Petaluma to San Francisco to watch the 49ers game with his father on January 19 .
He never made it there .
I called Petaluma police and reported him missing that evening .
The next morning , two officers came to my home and reported that Mike &apos;s car was down at the bridge .
A witness had observed him jumping off the bridge at 1 : 58 p.m. the previous day .
Thanks so much for standing up for those who may be only temporarily too weak to stand for themselves .
Who hasn &apos;t been low before without suffering from a true mental illness ?
It shouldn &apos;t be so easy to end it .
My prayers are with you for your fight .
The GGB , Golden Gate Bridge , is supposed to be a passage across our beautiful bay , not a graveyard .
Good luck this week . Vicky . &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine the courage it takes for her to go down to that bridge and walk the path that her son took that day , and also the courage just to carry on .
I &apos;d like to introduce you to a man I refer to as hope and courage .
On March 11 of 2005 , I responded to a radio call of a possible suicidal subject on the bridge sidewalk near the north tower .
I rode my motorcycle down the sidewalk and observed this man , Kevin Berthia , standing on the sidewalk .
When he saw me , he immediately traversed that pedestrian rail , and stood on that small pipe which goes around the tower .
For the next hour and a half , I listened as Kevin spoke about his depression and hopelessness .
Kevin decided on his own that day to come back over that rail and give life another chance .
When Kevin came back over , I congratulated him .
&quot; This is a new beginning , a new life . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; You listened .
You let me speak , and you just listened . &quot; &quot; Shortly after this incident , I received a letter from Kevin &apos;s mother , and I have that letter with me , and I &apos;d like to read it to you .
&quot; &quot; Dear Mr. Briggs , Nothing will erase the events of March 11 , but you are one of the reasons Kevin is still with us .
I truly believe Kevin was crying out for help .
He has been diagnosed with a mental illness for which he has been properly medicated .
I adopted Kevin when he was only six months old , completely unaware of any hereditary traits , but , thank God , now we know .
Kevin is straight , as he says .
We truly thank God for you .
Sincerely indebted to you , Narvella Berthia . &quot; &quot; And on the bottom she writes , &quot; &quot; P.S. When I visited San Francisco General Hospital that evening , you were listed as the patient .
Boy , did I have to straighten that one out . &quot; &quot; Today , Kevin is a loving father and contributing member of society .
He speaks openly about the events that day and his depression in the hopes that his story will inspire others .
Suicide is not just something I &apos;ve encountered on the job .
It &apos;s personal .
My grandfather committed suicide by poisoning .
That act , although ending his own pain , robbed me from ever getting to know him .
This is what suicide does .
For most suicidal folks , or those contemplating suicide , they wouldn &apos;t think of hurting another person .
They just want their own pain to end .
Typically , this is accomplished in just three ways : sleep , drugs or alcohol , or death .
Of those incidents I &apos;ve been directly involved with , I &apos;ve only lost two , but that &apos;s two too many .
One was Jason .
The other was a man I spoke to for about an hour .
During that time , he shook my hand on three occasions .
On that final handshake , he looked at me , and he said , &quot; Kevin , I &apos;m sorry , but I have to go . &quot;
And he leapt .
Horrible , absolutely horrible .
I do want to tell you , though , the vast majority of folks that we do get to contact on that bridge do not commit suicide .
Additionally , that very few who have jumped off the bridge and lived and can talk about it , that one to two percent , most of those folks have said that the second that they let go of that rail , they knew that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live .
I tell people , the bridge not only connects Marin to San Francisco , but people together also .
That connection , or bridge that we make , is something that each and every one of us should strive to do .
Suicide is preventable .
There is help . There is hope .
Thank you very much .

Let &apos;s talk trash .
You know , we had to be taught to renounce the powerful conservation ethic we developed during the Great Depression and World War II .
After the war , we needed to direct our enormous production capacity toward creation of products for peacetime .
Life Magazine helped in this effort by announcing the introduction of throwaways that would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of doing dishes .
Mental note to the liberators : throwaway plastics take a lot of space and don &apos;t biodegrade .
Only we humans make waste that nature can &apos;t digest .
Plastics are also hard to recycle .
A teacher told me how to express the under-five-percent of plastics recovered in our waste stream .
It &apos;s diddly-point-squat .
That &apos;s the percentage we recycle .
Now , melting point has a lot to do with this .
Plastic is not purified by the re-melting process like glass and metal .
It begins to melt below the boiling point of water and does not drive off the oily contaminants for which it is a sponge .
Half of each year &apos;s 100 billion pounds of thermal plastic pellets will be made into fast-track trash .
A large , unruly fraction of our trash will flow downriver to the sea .
Here is the accumulation at Biona Creek next to the L.A. airport .
And here is the flotsam near California State University Long Beach and the diesel plant we visited yesterday .
In spite of deposit fees , much of this trash leading out to the sea will be plastic beverage bottles .
We use two million of them in the United States every five minutes , here imaged by TED presenter Chris Jordan , who artfully documents mass consumption and zooms in for more detail .
Here is a remote island repository for bottles off the coast of Baja California .
Isla San Roque is an uninhabited bird rookery off Baja &apos;s sparsely populated central coast .
Notice that the bottles here have caps on them .
Bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate , PET , will sink in seawater and not make it this far from civilization .
Also , the caps are produced in separate factories from a different plastic , polypropylene .
They will float in seawater , but unfortunately do not get recycled under the bottle bills .
Let &apos;s trace the journey of the millions of caps that make it to sea solo .
After a year the ones from Japan are heading straight across the Pacific , while ours get caught in the California current and first head down to the latitude of Cabo San Lucas .
After ten years , a lot of the Japanese caps are in what we call the Eastern Garbage Patch , while ours litter the Philippines .
After 20 years , we see emerging the debris accumulation zone of the North Pacific Gyre .
It so happens that millions of albatross nesting on Kure and Midway atolls in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands National Monument forage here and scavenge whatever they can find for regurgitation to their chicks .
A four-month old Laysan Albatross chick died with this in its stomach .
Hundreds of thousands of the goose-sized chicks are dying with stomachs full of bottle caps and other rubbish , like cigarette lighters ...
but , mostly bottle caps .
Sadly , their parents mistake bottle caps for food tossing about in the ocean surface .
The retainer rings for the caps also have consequences for aquatic animals .
This is Mae West , still alive at a zookeeper &apos;s home in New Orleans .
I wanted to see what my home town of Long Beach was contributing to the problem , so on Coastal Clean-Up Day in 2005 I went to the Long Beach Peninsula , at the east end of our long beach .
We cleaned up the swaths of beach shown .
I offered five cents each for bottle caps .
I got plenty of takers .
Here are the 1,100 bottle caps they collected .
I thought I would spend 20 bucks .
That day I ended up spending nearly 60 .
I separated them by color and put them on display the next Earth Day at Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro .
Governor Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria stopped by to discuss the display .
In spite of my &quot; &quot; girly man &quot; &quot; hat , crocheted from plastic shopping bags , they shook my hand . ( Laughter ) I showed him and Maria a zooplankton trawl from the gyre north of Hawaii with more plastic than plankton .
Here &apos;s what our trawl samples from the plastic soup our ocean has become look like .
Trawling a zooplankton net on the surface for a mile produces samples like this .
And this .
Now , when the debris washes up on the beaches of Hawaii it looks like this .
And this particular beach is Kailua Beach , the beach where our president and his family vacationed before moving to Washington .
Now , how do we analyze samples like this one that contain more plastic than plankton ?
We sort the plastic fragments into different size classes , from five millimeters to one-third of a millimeter .
Small bits of plastic concentrate persistent organic pollutants up to a million times their levels in the surrounding seawater .
We wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean , at the base of the food chain , was ingesting these poison pills .
We did hundreds of necropsies , and over a third had polluted plastic fragments in their stomachs .
The record-holder , only two-and-a-half inches long , had 84 pieces in its tiny stomach .
Now , you can buy certified organic produce .
But no fishmonger on Earth can sell you a certified organic wild-caught fish .
This is the legacy we are leaving to future generations .
The throwaway society cannot be contained — it has gone global .
We simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff .
We have to throw it away .
Now , the market can do a lot for us , but it can &apos;t fix the natural system in the ocean we &apos;ve broken .
All the king &apos;s horses and all the king &apos;s men ...
will never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again .
Narrator ( Video ) : The levels are increasing , the amount of packaging is increasing , the &quot; &quot; throwaway &quot; &quot; concept of living is proliferating , and it &apos;s showing up in the ocean .
Anchor : He offers no hope of cleaning it up .
Straining the ocean for plastic would be beyond the budget of any country and it might kill untold amounts of sea life in the process .
The solution , Moore says , is to stop the plastic at its source : stop it on land before it falls in the ocean .
And in a plastic-wrapped and packaged world , he doesn &apos;t hold out much hope for that , either .
This is Brian Rooney for Nightline , in Long Beach , California .
Charles Moore : Thank you .
How does the news shape the way we see the world ?
Here &apos;s the world based on the way it looks — based on landmass .
And here &apos;s how news shapes what Americans see .
This map — ( Applause ) — this map shows the number of seconds that American network and cable news organizations dedicated to news stories , by country , in February of 2007 — just one year ago .
Now , this was a month when North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities .
There was massive flooding in Indonesia .
And in Paris , the IPCC released its study confirming man &apos;s impact on global warming .
The U.S. accounted for 79 percent of total news coverage .
And when we take out the U.S. and look at the remaining 21 percent , we see a lot of Iraq — that &apos;s that big green thing there — and little else .
The combined coverage of Russia , China and India , for example , reached just one percent .
When we analyzed all the news stories and removed just one story , here &apos;s how the world looked .
What was that story ? The death of Anna Nicole Smith .
This story eclipsed every country except Iraq , and received 10 times the coverage of the IPCC report .
And the cycle continues ; as we all know , Britney has loomed pretty large lately .
So , why don &apos;t we hear more about the world ?
One reason is that news networks have reduced the number of their foreign bureaus by half .
Aside from one-person ABC mini-bureaus in Nairobi , New Delhi and Mumbai , there are no network news bureaus in all of Africa , India or South America — places that are home to more than two billion people .
The reality is that covering Britney is cheaper .
And this lack of global coverage is all the more disturbing when we see where people go for news .
Local TV news looms large , and unfortunately only dedicates 12 percent of its coverage to international news .
And what about the web ?
The most popular news sites don &apos;t do much better .
Last year , Pew and the Colombia J-School analyzed the 14,000 stories that appeared on Google News &apos; front page .
And they , in fact , covered the same 24 news events .
Similarly , a study in e-content showed that much of global news from U.S. news creators is recycled stories from the AP wire services and Reuters , and don &apos;t put things into a context that people can understand their connection to it .
So , if you put it all together , this could help explain why today &apos;s college graduates , as well as less educated Americans , know less about the world than their counterparts did 20 years ago .
And if you think it &apos;s simply because we are not interested , you would be wrong .
In recent years , Americans who say they closely follow global news most of the time grew to over 50 percent .
The real question : is this distorted worldview what we want for Americans in our increasingly interconnected world ?
I know we can do better .
And can we afford not to ? Thank you .
It &apos;s like you dipped a marble in water .
They can handle a hurricane that comes and goes .
If you go to the site of the blowout , it looks pretty unbelievable .
It looks like you just emptied the oil pan in your car , and you just dumped it in the ocean .
signs of their outrage ...
There &apos;s a lot you can &apos;t see , also , underwater .
I think it &apos;s being hidden on purpose .
These guys have to swim around through it .
That guide &apos;s entire calendar year is canceled bookings .
He has no bookings left .
That &apos;s the story of thousands of people .
These tuna swim the entire ocean .
They get in the Gulf Stream , they go all the way to Europe .
And that lower photo , that &apos;s a bird colony that has been boomed .
These birds make a living by diving into the water .
But really , where are those birds going to get released to ?
So it &apos;s a continued fight .
It &apos;s a historic moment right now .
Who says it &apos;s too expensive ?
The bad news is that &apos;s not true .
The dominant kind of snobbery that exists nowadays is job snobbery .
I don &apos;t think we are particularly materialistic .
So that &apos;s another way in which something quite positive can have a nasty kickback .
And it &apos;s , again , linked to something nice .
And that makes failure seem much more crushing .
That &apos;s exhilarating if you &apos;re doing well , and very crushing if you &apos;re not .
This idea that everybody deserves to get where they get to , I think it &apos;s a crazy idea , completely crazy .
There are simply too many random factors : accidents , accidents of birth , accidents of things dropping on people &apos;s heads , illnesses , etc .
That is an unknown part of them , and we shouldn &apos;t behave as though it is known .
I gave them the plotline of Madame Bovary .
( Applause ) In a way , if you like , at one end of the spectrum of sympathy , you &apos;ve got the tabloid newspaper .
The other thing about modern society and why it causes this anxiety , is that we have nothing at its center that is non-human .
It &apos;s an escape from our own competition , and our own dramas .
What I think I &apos;ve been talking about really is success and failure .
When we &apos;re told that banking is a very respectable profession , a lot of us want to go into banking .
When banking is no longer so respectable , we lose interest in banking .
But what I really want to stress is : by all means , success , yes .
But let &apos;s accept the strangeness of some of our ideas .
Thank you very much .
And it &apos;s a very hard line to make .
That was , of course , by Le Corbusier , the famous architect .
He meant that you can see the sky and that you can experience the sun .
So you can preserve the darkness and make the light .
So we have to rethink the way we light our cities .
So it doesn &apos;t matter whatsoever .
Then she sees the other one getting grape , and you will see what happens .
Seven years ago , a student came to me and asked me to invest in his company .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m working with three friends , and we &apos;re going to try to disrupt an industry by selling stuff online . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; OK , you guys spent the whole summer on this , right ? &quot; &quot; &quot; No , we all took internships just in case it doesn &apos;t work out . &quot;
&quot; All right , but you &apos;re going to go in full time once you graduate . &quot;
&quot; Not exactly . We &apos;ve all lined up backup jobs . &quot;
Six months go by , it &apos;s the day before the company launches , and there is still not a functioning website .
&quot; &quot; You guys realize , the entire company is a website .
That &apos;s literally all it is . &quot; &quot; So I obviously declined to invest .
And they ended up naming the company Warby Parker .
( Laughter ) They sell glasses online .
They were recently recognized as the world &apos;s most innovative company and valued at over a billion dollars .
And now ? My wife handles our investments .
Why was I so wrong ?
To find out , I &apos;ve been studying people that I come to call &quot; &quot; originals . &quot; &quot; Originals are nonconformists , people who not only have new ideas but take action to champion them .
They are people who stand out and speak up .
Originals drive creativity and change in the world .
They &apos;re the people you want to bet on .
And they look nothing like I expected .
I want to show you today three things I &apos;ve learned about recognizing originals and becoming a little bit more like them .
So the first reason that I passed on Warby Parker was they were really slow getting off the ground .
Now , you are all intimately familiar with the mind of a procrastinator .
Well , I have a confession for you . I &apos;m the opposite . I &apos;m a precrastinator .
Yes , that &apos;s an actual term .
You know that panic you feel a few hours before a big deadline when you haven &apos;t done anything yet .
I just feel that a few months ahead of time .
( Laughter ) So this started early : when I was a kid , I took Nintendo games very seriously .
I would wake up at 5am , start playing and not stop until I had mastered them .
Eventually it got so out of hand that a local newspaper came and did a story on the dark side of Nintendo , starring me .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Since then , I have traded hair for teeth . ( Laughter )
But this served me well in college , because I finished my senior thesis four months before the deadline .
And I was proud of that , until a few years ago .
I had a student named Jihae , who came to me and said , &quot; I have my most creative ideas when I &apos;m procrastinating . &quot;
And I was like , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s cute , where are the four papers you owe me ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) No , she was one of our most creative students , and as an organizational psychologist , this is the kind of idea that I test .
So I challenged her to get some data .
She goes into a bunch of companies .
She has people fill out surveys about how often they procrastinate .
Then she gets their bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are .
And sure enough , the precrastinators like me , who rush in and do everything early are rated as less creative than people who procrastinate moderately .
So I want to know what happens to the chronic procrastinators .
She was like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . They didn &apos;t fill out my survey . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) No , here are our results .
You actually do see that the people who wait until the last minute are so busy goofing off that they don &apos;t have any new ideas .
And on the flip side , the people who race in are in such a frenzy of anxiety that they don &apos;t have original thoughts either .
There &apos;s a sweet spot where originals seem to live .
Why is this ?
Maybe original people just have bad work habits .
Maybe procrastinating does not cause creativity .
To find out , we designed some experiments .
We asked people to generate new business ideas , and then we get independent readers to evaluate how creative and useful they are .
And some of them are asked to do the task right away .
Others we randomly assign to procrastinate by dangling Minesweeper in front of them for either five or 10 minutes .
And sure enough , the moderate procrastinators are 16 percent more creative than the other two groups .
Now , Minesweeper is awesome , but it &apos;s not the driver of the effect , because if you play the game first before you learn about the task , there &apos;s no creativity boost .
It &apos;s only when you &apos;re told that you &apos;re going to be working on this problem , and then you start procrastinating , but the task is still active in the back of your mind , that you start to incubate .
Procrastination gives you time to consider divergent ideas , to think in nonlinear ways , to make unexpected leaps .
So just as we were finishing these experiments , I was starting to write a book about originals , and I thought , &quot; &quot; This is the perfect time to teach myself to procrastinate , while writing a chapter on procrastination . &quot; &quot; So I metaprocrastinated , and like any self-respecting precrastinator , I woke up early the next morning and I made a to-do list with steps on how to procrastinate .
( Laughter ) And then I worked diligently toward my goal of not making progress toward my goal .
I started writing the procrastination chapter , and one day — I was halfway through — I literally put it away in mid-sentence for months .
It was agony .
But when I came back to it , I had all sorts of new ideas .
As Aaron Sorkin put it , &quot; You call it procrastinating . I call it thinking . &quot;
And along the way I discovered that a lot of great originals in history were procrastinators .
Take Leonardo da Vinci .
He toiled on and off for 16 years on the Mona Lisa .
He felt like a failure .
He wrote as much in his journal .
But some of the diversions he took in optics transformed the way that he modeled light and made him into a much better painter .
What about Martin Luther King , Jr . ?
The night before the biggest speech of his life , the March on Washington , he was up past 3am , rewriting it .
He &apos;s sitting in the audience waiting for his turn to go onstage , and he is still scribbling notes and crossing out lines .
When he gets onstage , 11 minutes in , he leaves his prepared remarks to utter four words that changed the course of history : &quot; I have a dream . &quot;
That was not in the script .
By delaying the task of finalizing the speech until the very last minute , he left himself open to the widest range of possible ideas .
And because the text wasn &apos;t set in stone , he had freedom to improvise .
Procrastinating is a vice when it comes to productivity , but it can be a virtue for creativity .
What you see with a lot of great originals is that they are quick to start but they &apos;re slow to finish .
And this is what I missed with Warby Parker .
When they were dragging their heels for six months , I looked at them and said , &quot; You know , a lot of other companies are starting to sell glasses online . &quot;
They missed the first-mover advantage .
But what I didn &apos;t realize was they were spending all that time trying to figure out how to get people to be comfortable ordering glasses online .
And it turns out the first-mover advantage is mostly a myth .
Look at a classic study of over 50 product categories , comparing the first movers who created the market with the improvers who introduced something different and better .
What you see is that the first movers had a failure rate of 47 percent , compared with only 8 percent for the improvers .
Look at Facebook , waiting to build a social network until after Myspace and Friendster .
Look at Google , waiting for years after Altavista and Yahoo .
It &apos;s much easier to improve on somebody else &apos;s idea than it is to create something new from scratch .
So the lesson I learned is that to be original you don &apos;t have to be first .
You just have to be different and better .
But that wasn &apos;t the only reason I passed on Warby Parker .
They were also full of doubts .
They had backup plans lined up , and that made me doubt that they had the courage to be original , because I expected that originals would look something like this .
( Laughter ) Now , on the surface , a lot of original people look confident , but behind the scenes , they feel the same fear and doubt that the rest of us do .
They just manage it differently .
Let me show you : this is a depiction of how the creative process works for most of us .
( Laughter ) Now , in my research , I discovered there are two different kinds of doubt .
There &apos;s self-doubt and idea doubt .
Self-doubt is paralyzing .
It leads you to freeze .
But idea doubt is energizing .
It motivates you to test , to experiment , to refine , just like MLK did .
And so the key to being original is just a simple thing of avoiding the leap from step three to step four .
Instead of saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m crap , &quot; &quot; you say , &quot; &quot; The first few drafts are always crap , and I &apos;m just not there yet . &quot; &quot; So how do you get there ?
Well , there &apos;s a clue , it turns out , in the Internet browser that you use .
We can predict your job performance and your commitment just by knowing what web browser you use .
Now , some of you are not going to like the results of this study — ( Laughter ) But there is good evidence that Firefox and Chrome users significantly outperform Internet Explorer and Safari users .
Yes .
( Applause ) They also stay in their jobs 15 percent longer , by the way .
Why ? It &apos;s not a technical advantage .
The four browser groups on average have similar typing speed and they also have similar levels of computer knowledge .
It &apos;s about how you got the browser .
Because if you use Internet Explorer or Safari , those came preinstalled on your computer , and you accepted the default option that was handed to you .
If you wanted Firefox or Chrome , you had to doubt the default and ask , is there a different option out there , and then be a little resourceful and download a new browser .
So people hear about this study and they &apos;re like , &quot; Great , if I want to get better at my job , I just need to upgrade my browser ? &quot;
( Laughter ) No , it &apos;s about being the kind of person who takes the initiative to doubt the default and look for a better option .
And if you do that well , you will open yourself up to the opposite of déjà vu .
There &apos;s a name for it . It &apos;s called vuja de .
( Laughter ) Vuja de is when you look at something you &apos;ve seen many times before and all of a sudden see it with fresh eyes .
It &apos;s a screenwriter who looks at a movie script that can &apos;t get the green light for more than half a century .
In every past version , the main character has been an evil queen .
But Jennifer Lee starts to question whether that makes sense .
She rewrites the first act , reinvents the villain as a tortured hero and Frozen becomes the most successful animated movie ever .
So there &apos;s a simple message from this story .
When you feel doubt , don &apos;t let it go .
( Laughter ) What about fear ?
Originals feel fear , too .
They &apos;re afraid of failing , but what sets them apart from the rest of us is that they &apos;re even more afraid of failing to try .
They know you can fail by starting a business that goes bankrupt or by failing to start a business at all .
They know that in the long run , our biggest regrets are not our actions but our inactions .
The things we wish we could redo , if you look at the science , are the chances not taken .
Elon Musk told me recently , he didn &apos;t expect Tesla to succeed .
He was sure the first few SpaceX launches would fail to make it to orbit , let alone get back , but it was too important not to try .
And for so many of us , when we have an important idea , we don &apos;t bother to try .
But I have some good news for you .
You are not going to get judged on your bad ideas .
A lot of people think they will .
If you look across industries and ask people about their biggest idea , their most important suggestion , 85 percent of them stayed silent instead of speaking up .
They were afraid of embarrassing themselves , of looking stupid .
But guess what ? Originals have lots and lots of bad ideas , tons of them , in fact .
Take the guy who invented this .
Do you care that he came up with a talking doll so creepy that it scared not only kids but adults , too ?
No . You celebrate Thomas Edison for pioneering the light bulb .
( Laughter ) If you look across fields , the greatest originals are the ones who fail the most , because they &apos;re the ones who try the most .
Take classical composers , the best of the best .
Why do some of them get more pages in encyclopedias than others and also have their compositions rerecorded more times ?
One of the best predictors is the sheer volume of compositions that they generate .
The more output you churn out , the more variety you get and the better your chances of stumbling on something truly original .
Even the three icons of classical music — Bach , Beethoven , Mozart — had to generate hundreds and hundreds of compositions to come up with a much smaller number of masterpieces .
Now , you may be wondering , how did this guy become great without doing a whole lot ?
I don &apos;t know how Wagner pulled that off .
But for most of us , if we want to be more original , we have to generate more ideas .
The Warby Parker founders , when they were trying to name their company , they needed something sophisticated , unique , with no negative associations to build a retail brand , and they tested over 2,000 possibilities before they finally put together Warby and Parker .
So if you put all this together , what you see is that originals are not that different from the rest of us .
They feel fear and doubt . They procrastinate .
They have bad ideas .
And sometimes , it &apos;s not in spite of those qualities but because of them that they succeed .
So when you see those things , don &apos;t make the same mistake I did .
Don &apos;t write them off .
And when that &apos;s you , don &apos;t count yourself out either .
Know that being quick to start but slow to finish can boost your creativity , that you can motivate yourself by doubting your ideas and embracing the fear of failing to try , and that you need a lot of bad ideas in order to get a few good ones .
Look , being original is not easy , but I have no doubt about this : it &apos;s the best way to improve the world around us .
Thank you .

I am a reformed marketer , and I now work in international development .
In October , I spent some time in the Democratic Republic of Congo , which is the &#91; second &#93; largest country in Africa .
In fact , it &apos;s as large as Western Europe , but it only has 300 miles of paved roads .
The DRC is a dangerous place .
In the past 10 years , five million people have died due to a war in the east .
But war isn &apos;t the only reason that life is difficult in the DRC .
There are many health issues as well .
In fact , the HIV prevalence rate is 1.3 percent among adults .
This might not sound like a large number , but in a country with 76 million people , it means there are 930,000 that are infected .
And due to the poor infrastructure , only 25 percent of those are receiving the life-saving drugs that they need .
Which is why , in part , donor agencies provide condoms at low or no cost .
And so while I was in the DRC , I spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms , including Damien .
Damien runs a hotel outside of Kinshasa .
It &apos;s a hotel that &apos;s only open until midnight , so it &apos;s not a place that you stay .
But it is a place where sex workers and their clients come .
Now Damien knows all about condoms , but he doesn &apos;t sell them .
He said there &apos;s just not in demand .
It &apos;s not surprising , because only three percent of people in the DRC use condoms .
Joseph and Christine , who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms , said despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low or no cost , and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them , their customers don &apos;t buy the branded versions .
They like the generics .
And as a marketer , I found that curious .
And so I started to look at what the marketing looked like .
And it turns out that there are three main messages used by the donor agencies for these condoms : fear , financing and fidelity .
They name the condoms things like Vive , &quot; &quot; to live &quot; &quot; or Trust .
They package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of HIV , put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them , show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently .
Now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom .
( Laughter ) What is it that you think about just before you get a condom ?
Sex !
And the private companies that sell condoms in these places , they understand this .
Their marketing is slightly different .
The name might not be much different , but the imagery sure is .
Some brands are aspirational , and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative .
And this made me think that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out on a key aspect of marketing : understanding who &apos;s the audience .
And for donor agencies , unfortunately , the audience tends to be people that aren &apos;t even in the country they &apos;re working &#91; in &#93; .
It &apos;s people back home , people that support their work , people like these .
But if what we &apos;re really trying to do is stop the spread of HIV , we need to think about the customer , the people whose behavior needs to change — the couples , the young women , the young men — whose lives depend on it .
And so the lesson is this : it doesn &apos;t really matter what you &apos;re selling ; you just have to think about who is your customer , and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior .
It might just save their lives .
Thank you .

But until recently , we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe .
Issuing an insurance policy against abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet .
This answer took seven minutes , and really gave me an insight into the incredible act of generosity this whole talk was for TED .
Auguste was delusional and couldn &apos;t remember even the most basic details of her life .
Her doctor was called Alois .
If Auguste had instead been alive today , we could offer her no more help than Alois was able to 114 years ago .
Alois was Dr. Alois Alzheimer .
And Auguste Deter was the first patient to be diagnosed with what we now call Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
Since 1901 , medicine has advanced greatly .
We &apos;ve discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infections , many treatments for cancer , antiretrovirals for HIV , statins for heart disease and much more .
But we &apos;ve made essentially no progress at all in treating Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
So I think about this all the time .
Alzheimer &apos;s now affects 40 million people worldwide .
But by 2050 , it will affect 150 million people — which , by the way , will include many of you .
If you &apos;re hoping to live to be 85 or older , your chance of getting Alzheimer &apos;s will be almost one in two .
In other words , odds are you &apos;ll spend your golden years either suffering from Alzheimer &apos;s or helping to look after a friend or loved one with Alzheimer &apos;s .
Already in the United States alone , Alzheimer &apos;s care costs 200 billion dollars every year .
One out of every five Medicare dollars get spent on Alzheimer &apos;s .
It is today the most expensive disease , and costs are projected to increase fivefold by 2050 , as the baby boomer generation ages .
It may surprise you that , put simply , Alzheimer &apos;s is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation .
But we &apos;ve done relatively little to address it .
Today , of the top 10 causes of death worldwide , Alzheimer &apos;s is the only one we cannot prevent , cure or even slow down .
We understand less about the science of Alzheimer &apos;s than other diseases because we &apos;ve invested less time and money into researching it .
The US government spends 10 times more every year on cancer research than on Alzheimer &apos;s despite the fact that Alzheimer &apos;s costs us more and causes a similar number of deaths each year as cancer .
The lack of resources stems from a more fundamental cause : a lack of awareness .
Because here &apos;s what few people know but everyone should : Alzheimer &apos;s is a disease , and we can cure it .
For most of the past 114 years , everyone , including scientists , mistakenly confused Alzheimer &apos;s with aging .
But we only have to look at a picture of a healthy aged brain compared to the brain of an Alzheimer &apos;s patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease .
As well as triggering severe loss of memory and mental abilities , the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer &apos;s significantly reduces life expectancy and is always fatal .
Remember Dr. Alzheimer found strange plaques and tangles in Auguste &apos;s brain a century ago .
For almost a century , we didn &apos;t know much about these .
Today we know they &apos;re made from protein molecules .
You can imagine a protein molecule as a piece of paper that normally folds into an elaborate piece of origami .
There are spots on the paper that are sticky .
And when it folds correctly , these sticky bits end up on the inside .
But sometimes things go wrong , and some sticky bits are on the outside .
This causes the protein molecules to stick to each other , forming clumps that eventually become large plaques and tangles .
That &apos;s what we see in the brains of Alzheimer &apos;s patients .
We &apos;ve spent the past 10 years at the University of Cambridge trying to understand how this malfunction works .
Cutting one wire might do nothing .
Until recently , we for the most part have been cutting wires and hoping for the best .
But now we &apos;ve got together a diverse group of people — medics , biologists , geneticists , chemists , physicists , engineers and mathematicians .
And together , we &apos;ve managed to identify a critical step in the process and are now testing a new class of drugs which would specifically block this step and stop the disease .
Now let me show you some of our latest results .
No one outside of our lab has seen these yet .
Let &apos;s look at some videos of what happened when we tested these new drugs in worms .
So these are healthy worms , and you can see they &apos;re moving around normally .
These worms , on the other hand , have protein molecules sticking together inside them — like humans with Alzheimer &apos;s .
And you can see they &apos;re clearly sick .
But if we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage , then we see that they &apos;re healthy , and they live a normal lifespan .
But to grow that hope , to finally beat Alzheimer &apos;s , we need help .
This isn &apos;t about scientists like me — it &apos;s about you .
We need you to raise awareness that Alzheimer &apos;s is a disease and that if we try , we can beat it .
In the case of other diseases , patients and their families have led the charge for more research and put pressure on governments , the pharmaceutical industry , scientists and regulators .
That was essential for advancing treatment for HIV in the late 1980s .
Today , we see that same drive to beat cancer .
But Alzheimer &apos;s patients are often unable to speak up for themselves .
So , it really is down to you .
Alzheimer &apos;s isn &apos;t , for the most part , a genetic disease .
Everyone with a brain is at risk .
Today , there are 40 million patients like Auguste , who can &apos;t create the change they need for themselves .
Help speak up for them , and help demand a cure .
Thank you .

What &apos;s in the box ?
Whatever it is must be pretty important , because I &apos;ve traveled with it , moved it , from apartment to apartment to apartment .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Sound familiar ?
Did you know that we Americans have about three times the amount of space we did 50 years ago ?
Three times .
So you &apos;d think , with all this extra space , we &apos;d have plenty of room for all our stuff .
Nope .
There &apos;s a new industry in town , a 22 billion-dollar , 2.2 billion sq. ft. industry : that of personal storage .
So we &apos;ve got triple the space , but we &apos;ve become such good shoppers that we need even more space .
So where does this lead ?
Lots of credit card debt , huge environmental footprints , and perhaps not coincidentally , our happiness levels flat-lined over the same 50 years .
Well I &apos;m here to suggest there &apos;s a better way , that less might actually equal more .
I bet most of us have experienced at some point the joys of less : college — in your dorm , traveling — in a hotel room , camping — rig up basically nothing , maybe a boat .
Whatever it was for you , I bet that , among other things , this gave you a little more freedom , a little more time .
So I &apos;m going to suggest that less stuff and less space are going to equal a smaller footprint .
It &apos;s actually a great way to save you some money .
And it &apos;s going to give you a little more ease in your life .
So I started a project called Life Edited at lifeedited.org to further this conversation and to find some great solutions in this area .
First up : crowd-sourcing my 420 sq. ft. apartment in Manhattan with partners Mutopo and Jovoto.com.
I wanted it all — home office , sit down dinner for 10 , room for guests , and all my kite surfing gear .
With over 300 entries from around the world , I got it , my own little jewel box .
By buying a space that was 420 sq. ft .
instead of 600 , immediately I &apos;m saving 200 grand .
Smaller space is going to make for smaller utilities — save some more money there , but also a smaller footprint .
And because it &apos;s really designed around an edited set of possessions — my favorite stuff — and really designed for me , I &apos;m really excited to be there .
So how can you live little ?
Three main approaches .
First of all , you have to edit ruthlessly .
We &apos;ve got to clear the arteries of our lives .
And that shirt that I hadn &apos;t worn in years ?
It &apos;s time for me to let it go .
We &apos;ve got to cut the extraneous out of our lives , and we &apos;ve got to learn to stem the inflow .
We need to think before we buy .
Ask ourselves , &quot; Is that really going to make me happier ? Truly ? &quot;
By all means , we should buy and own some great stuff .
But we want stuff that we &apos;re going to love for years , not just stuff .
Secondly , our new mantra : small is sexy .
We want space efficiency .
We want things that are designed for how they &apos;re used the vast majority of the time , not that rare event .
Why have a six burner stove when you rarely use three ?
So we want things that nest , we want things that stack , and we want it digitized .
You can take paperwork , books , movies , and you can make it disappear — it &apos;s magic .
Finally , we want multifunctional spaces and housewares — a sink combined with a toilet , a dining table becomes a bed — same space , a little side table stretches out to seat 10 .
In the winning Life Edited scheme in a render here , we combine a moving wall with transformer furniture to get a lot out of the space .
Look at the coffee table — it grows in height and width to seat 10 .
My office folds away , easily hidden .
My bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers .
Guests ? Move the moving wall , have some fold-down guest beds .
And of course , my own movie theater .
So I &apos;m not saying that we all need to live in 420 sq. ft .
But consider the benefits of an edited life .
Go from 3,000 to 2,000 , from 1,500 to 1,000 .
Most of us , maybe all of us , are here pretty happily for a bunch of days with a couple of bags , maybe a small space , a hotel room .
So when you go home and you walk through your front door , take a second and ask yourselves , &quot; &quot; Could I do with a little life editing ?
Would that give me a little more freedom ?
Maybe a little more time ? &quot; &quot; What &apos;s in the box ?
It doesn &apos;t really matter .
I know I don &apos;t need it .
What &apos;s in yours ?
Maybe , just maybe , less might equal more .
So let &apos;s make room for the good stuff .
Thank you .

When I was 10 years old , a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school .
And as a special treat , he took me to the pathology lab and took a real human brain out of the jar and placed it in my hands .
And there it was , the seat of human consciousness , the powerhouse of the human body , sitting in my hands .
And that day I knew that when I grew up , I was going to become a brain doctor , scientist , something or the other .
Years later , when I finally grew up , my dream came true .
And it was while I was doing my Ph.D.
on the neurological causes of dyslexia in children that I encountered a startling fact that I &apos;d like to share with you all today .
It is estimated that one in six children , that &apos;s one in six children , suffer from some developmental disorder .
This is a disorder that retards mental development in the child and causes permanent mental impairments .
Which means that each and every one of you here today knows at least one child that is suffering from a developmental disorder .
But here &apos;s what really perplexed me .
Despite the fact that each and every one of these disorders originates in the brain , most of these disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis of observable behavior .
But diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms , without even doing an ECG or a chest X-ray to look at the heart .
It seemed so intuitive to me .
To diagnose and treat a brain disorder accurately , it would be necessary to look at the brain directly .
Looking at behavior alone can miss a vital piece of the puzzle and provide an incomplete , or even a misleading , picture of the child &apos;s problems .
Yet , despite all the advances in medical technology , the diagnosis of brain disorders in one in six children still remained so limited .
And then I came across a team at Harvard University that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally applied it , instead of in brain research , towards diagnosing brain disorders in children .
Their groundbreaking technology records the EEG , or the electrical activity of the brain , in real time , allowing us to watch the brain as it performs various functions and then detect even the slightest abnormality in any of these functions : vision , attention , language , audition .
A program called Brain Electrical Activity Mapping then triangulates the source of that abnormality in the brain .
And another program called Statistical Probability Mapping then performs mathematical calculations to determine whether any of these abnormalities are clinically significant , allowing us to provide a much more accurate neurological diagnosis of the child &apos;s symptoms .
And so I became the head of neurophysiology for the clinical arm of this team , and we &apos;re finally able to use this technology towards actually helping children with brain disorders .
And I &apos;m happy to say that I &apos;m now in the process of setting up this technology here in India .
I &apos;d like to tell you about one such child , whose story was also covered by ABC News .
Seven-year-old Justin Senigar came to our clinic with this diagnosis of very severe autism .
Like many autistic children , his mind was locked inside his body .
There were moments when he would actually space out for seconds at a time .
And the doctors told his parents he was never going to be able to communicate or interact socially , and he would probably never have too much language .
When we used this groundbreaking EEG technology to actually look at Justin &apos;s brain , the results were startling .
It turned out that Justin was almost certainly not autistic .
He was suffering from brain seizures that were impossible to see with the naked eye , but that were actually causing symptoms that mimicked those of autism .
After Justin was given anti-seizure medication , the change in him was amazing .
Within a period of 60 days , his vocabulary went from two to three words to 300 words .
And his communication and social interaction were improved so dramatically that he was enrolled into a regular school and even became a karate super champ .
Research shows that 50 percent of children , almost 50 percent of children diagnosed with autism are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures .
These are the faces of the children that I have tested with stories just like Justin .
All these children came to our clinic with a diagnosis of autism , attention deficit disorder , mental retardation , language problems .
Instead , our EEG scans revealed very specific problems hidden within their brains that couldn &apos;t possibly have been detected by their behavioral assessments .
So these EEG scans enabled us to provide these children with a much more accurate neurological diagnosis and much more targeted treatment .
For too long now , children with developmental disorders have suffered from misdiagnosis while their real problems have gone undetected and left to worsen .
And for too long , these children and their parents have suffered undue frustration and desperation .
But we are now in a new era of neuroscience , one in which we can finally look directly at brain function in real time with no risks and no side effects , non-invasively , and find the true source of so many disabilities in children .
So if I could inspire even a fraction of you in the audience today to share this pioneering diagnostic approach with even one parent whose child is suffering from a developmental disorder , then perhaps one more puzzle in one more brain will be solved .
One more mind will be unlocked .
And one more child who has been misdiagnosed or even undiagnosed by the system will finally realize his or her true potential while there &apos;s still time for his or her brain to recover .
And all this by simply watching the child &apos;s brainwaves .
Thank you .

( Nature sounds ) When I first began recording wild soundscapes 45 years ago , I had no idea that ants , insect larvae , sea anemones and viruses created a sound signature .
But they do .
And so does every wild habitat on the planet , like the Amazon rainforest you &apos;re hearing behind me .
In fact , temperate and tropical rainforests each produce a vibrant animal orchestra , that instantaneous and organized expression of insects , reptiles , amphibians , birds and mammals .
And every soundscape that springs from a wild habitat generates its own unique signature , one that contains incredible amounts of information , and it &apos;s some of that information I want to share with you today .
The soundscape is made up of three basic sources .
The first is the geophony , or the nonbiological sounds that occur in any given habitat , like wind in the trees , water in a stream , waves at the ocean shore , movement of the Earth .
The second of these is the biophony .
The biophony is all of the sound that &apos;s generated by organisms in a given habitat at one time and in one place .
And the third is all of the sound that we humans generate that &apos;s called anthrophony .
Some of it is controlled , like music or theater , but most of it is chaotic and incoherent , which some of us refer to as noise .
There was a time when I considered wild soundscapes to be a worthless artifact .
They were just there , but they had no significance .
Well , I was wrong . What I learned from these encounters was that careful listening gives us incredibly valuable tools by which to evaluate the health of a habitat across the entire spectrum of life .
When I began recording in the late &apos; 60s , the typical methods of recording were limited to the fragmented capture of individual species like birds mostly , in the beginning , but later animals like mammals and amphibians .
To me , this was a little like trying to understand the magnificence of Beethoven &apos;s Fifth Symphony by abstracting the sound of a single violin player out of the context of the orchestra and hearing just that one part .
Fortunately , more and more institutions are implementing the more holistic models that I and a few of my colleagues have introduced to the field of soundscape ecology .
Now , because of global warming , resource extraction , and human noise , among many other factors , it can take up to 1,000 hours or more to capture the same thing .
Fully 50 percent of my archive comes from habitats so radically altered that they &apos;re either altogether silent or can no longer be heard in any of their original form .
The usual methods of evaluating a habitat have been done by visually counting the numbers of species and the numbers of individuals within each species in a given area .
However , by comparing data that ties together both density and diversity from what we hear , I &apos;m able to arrive at much more precise fitness outcomes .
And I want to show you some examples that typify the possibilities unlocked by diving into this universe .
This is Lincoln Meadow .
With permission granted to record both before and after the operation , I set up my gear and captured a large number of dawn choruses to very strict protocol and calibrated recordings , because I wanted a really good baseline .
This is an example of a spectrogram .
A spectrogram is a graphic illustration of sound with time from left to right across the page — 15 seconds in this case is represented — and frequency from the bottom of the page to the top , lowest to highest .
And you can see that the signature of a stream is represented here in the bottom third or half of the page , while birds that were once in that meadow are represented in the signature across the top .
There were a lot of them .
And here &apos;s Lincoln Meadow before selective logging .
( Nature sounds ) Well , a year later I returned , and using the same protocols and recording under the same conditions , I recorded a number of examples of the same dawn choruses , and now this is what we &apos;ve got .
This is after selective logging .
( Nature sounds ) Coming up is the sound of a woodpecker .
Well , I &apos;ve returned to Lincoln Meadow 15 times in the last 25 years , and I can tell you that the biophony , the density and diversity of that biophony , has not yet returned to anything like it was before the operation .
But here &apos;s a picture of Lincoln Meadow taken after , and you can see that from the perspective of the camera or the human eye , hardly a stick or a tree appears to be out of place , which would confirm the logging company &apos;s contention that there &apos;s nothing of environmental impact .
However , our ears tell us a very different story .
But I can tell you that they do express themselves .
Whether or not we understand it is a different story .
I was walking along the shore in Alaska , and I came across this tide pool filled with a colony of sea anemones , these wonderful eating machines , relatives of coral and jellyfish .
The static-like sounds that are very low , that you &apos;re going to hear right now .
( Static sounds ) Yeah , but watch . When it didn &apos;t find anything to eat — ( Honking sound ) ( Laughter ) I think that &apos;s an expression that can be understood in any language . ( Laughter )
At the end of its breeding cycle , the Great Basin Spadefoot toad digs itself down about a meter under the hard-panned desert soil of the American West , where it can stay for many seasons until conditions are just right for it to emerge again .
And they vocalize in a chorus that &apos;s absolutely in sync with one another .
And they do that for two reasons .
This is a spectrogram of what the frog chorusing looks like when it &apos;s in a very healthy pattern .
( Frogs croaking ) Now at the end of that flyby , it took the frogs fully 45 minutes to regain their chorusing synchronicity , during which time , and under a full moon , we watched as two coyotes and a great horned owl came in to pick off a few of their numbers .
The good news is that , with a little bit of habitat restoration and fewer flights , the frog populations , once diminishing during the 1980s and early &apos; 90s , have pretty much returned to normal .
I want to end with a story told by a beaver .
It &apos;s a very sad story , but it really illustrates how animals can sometimes show emotion , a very controversial subject among some older biologists .
A colleague of mine was recording in the American Midwest around this pond that had been formed maybe 16,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age .
It was also formed in part by a beaver dam at one end that held that whole ecosystem together in a very delicate balance .
And one afternoon , while he was recording , there suddenly appeared from out of nowhere a couple of game wardens , who for no apparent reason , walked over to the beaver dam , dropped a stick of dynamite down it , blowing it up , killing the female and her young babies .
This is probably the saddest sound I &apos;ve ever heard coming from any organism , human or other .
( Beaver crying ) Yeah . Well .
There are many facets to soundscapes , among them the ways in which animals taught us to dance and sing , which I &apos;ll save for another time .
But you have heard how biophonies help clarify our understanding of the natural world .
You &apos;ve heard the impact of resource extraction , human noise and habitat destruction .
Biophonies and geophonies are the signature voices of the natural world , and as we hear them , we &apos;re endowed with a sense of place , the true story of the world we live in .
In a matter of seconds , a soundscape reveals much more information from many perspectives , from quantifiable data to cultural inspiration .
Visual capture implicitly frames a limited frontal perspective of a given spatial context , while soundscapes widen that scope to a full 360 degrees , completely enveloping us .
And while a picture may be worth 1,000 words , a soundscape is worth 1,000 pictures .
And our ears tell us that the whisper of every leaf and creature speaks to the natural sources of our lives , which indeed may hold the secrets of love for all things , especially our own humanity , and the last word goes to a jaguar from the Amazon .
( Growling ) Thank you for listening .

Actually , I come from Britain , but I &apos;ve been living in Maldives for 26 years now .
So , that &apos;s home really .
The Maldives , as I &apos;m sure you &apos;re aware , are a chain of islands off the southwest coast of India here .
Capital , Malé , where I live .
Actually , sitting here today in Mysore , we &apos;re closer to Malé than we are to Delhi , for example .
If you &apos;re in IT , India , obviously , is the place to be at the moment .
But if you &apos;re a marine biologist , Maldives is not such a bad place to be .
And it has been my home these years .
For those of you who &apos;ve been there , fantastic coral reefs , fantastic diving , fantastic snorkeling .
I spend as much of my time as possible investigating the marine life .
I study fish , also the bigger things , whales and dolphins .
This is a blue whale . We have blue whales in the waters around here , off Maldives , around the waters of India . You can see them off Kerala .
And , in fact , we &apos;re very lucky in this region .
One of the best places in the world to see blue whales is here in this region .
In Sri Lanka , if you go down to the south coast of Sri Lanka , during the northeast monsoon season , you can see blue whales very , very easily .
It &apos;s probably the best place in the world to see them .
Now , when I talk about the northeast monsoon season , I &apos;m sure many of you here know exactly what I mean , but perhaps some of you are not quite so sure .
I need to explain a little bit about monsoons .
Now , monsoon , the root of the word &quot; &quot; monsoon &quot; &quot; comes from the word &quot; &quot; season . &quot; &quot; So , it &apos;s just a season . And there are two seasons in most of South Asia .
And in the summer India heats up , gets very hot .
Hot air rises , and air is drawn in off the sea to replace it .
And the way it works is , it comes from the southwest .
It comes off the ocean here and is drawn up towards India .
So it comes from the southwest . It &apos;s a southwest monsoon .
Picks up moisture as it crosses the ocean .
That &apos;s what brings the monsoon rain .
And then in the winter things cool down .
High pressure builds over India .
And the whole system goes into reverse .
So , the wind is now coming from the northeast out of India , across the Indian Ocean , this way towards Africa .
Keep that in mind .
Now , I &apos;m a marine biologist , but I &apos;m actually a bit of an old fashioned naturalist , I suppose .
I &apos;m interested in all sorts of things , almost everything that moves , including dragonflies . And I &apos;m actually going to talk , this afternoon , about dragonflies .
This is a very beautiful species , it &apos;s called the Oriental Scarlet .
And one thing you need to know about dragonflies , one important thing , is that they lay their eggs in fresh water .
They need fresh water to breed .
They lay the eggs into fresh water .
Little larvae hatch out in fresh water .
They feed on other little things . They feed on mosquito larvae .
So , they &apos;re very important .
They control mosquito larvae , among other things .
And they grow and grow by stages . And they climb out of the water , burst out , as the adult which we see .
And typically , there is a lot of variation , but if you have a dragonfly with , say , a one year life cycle , which is quite typical , the larva , living in the fresh water , lives for 10 or 11 months .
And then the adult , which comes after , lives for one or two months .
So it &apos;s essentially a freshwater animal .
It really does need fresh water .
Now , the particular species of dragonfly I want to talk about is this one , because most dragonflies , like the one we &apos;ve just seen , when the adult is there for its brief one or two months of life , it doesn &apos;t go very far . It can &apos;t travel very far .
A few kilometers , maybe , is quite typical .
They are very good fliers , but they don &apos;t go too far .
But this guy is an exception .
And this is called the Globe Skimmer , or Wandering Glider .
And , as the name might suggest , it is found pretty much around the world .
It lives throughout the tropics , the Americas , Africa , Asia , Australia , into the Pacific .
And it wanders far and wide . We know that much about it .
But it really hasn &apos;t been studied very much .
It &apos;s a rather mediocre looking dragonfly .
If you &apos;re going to study dragonflies , you want to study those really bright beautiful ones , like that red one . Or the really rare ones , the endemic endangered ones .
This is , it seems a bit dull you know .
It &apos;s sort of dull-colored . And it &apos;s fairly common .
And it occurs everywhere — you know , why bother ?
But if you take that attitude , you &apos;re actually missing something rather special .
Because this dragonfly has a rather amazing story to tell .
And I feel very privileged to have stumbled across it living in the Maldives .
When I first went to the Maldives , dead keen on diving , spent as much of my time as I could in and under the water .
Didn &apos;t notice any dragonflies ; maybe they were there , maybe they weren &apos;t .
Didn &apos;t notice them .
But after some time , after some months , one day as I was going out and about , suddenly I noticed hundreds of dragonflies , hundreds of dragonflies .
Something like this , these are all this species Globe Skimmer .
I didn &apos;t know at the time , but I know now , they &apos;re Globe Skimmers , hundreds of them .
And they were there for some time . And then they were gone .
And I didn &apos;t think anything more of it until the following year , when it happened again , and then the year after that , and then the year after that .
And I was a bit slow , I didn &apos;t really take too much notice .
But I asked some Maldivian friends and colleagues , and yes they come every year .
And I asked people about them and yes , they knew , but they didn &apos;t know anything , where they came from , or anything .
And again I didn &apos;t think too much of it .
But slowly it began to dawn on me that something rather special was happening .
Because dragonflies need fresh water to breed .
And the Maldives , and I &apos;m sure some of you have been there — so here is home .
So , Maldives , beautiful place .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s built entirely of coral reefs .
And on top of the coral reefs are sand banks .
Average height , about that much above sea level .
So , global warming , sea level rise , it &apos;s a real serious issue .
But I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
Another important point of these sand banks is that when it rains , the rainwater soaks down into the soil . So , it &apos;s gone .
So , it stays under the soil .
The trees can put their roots into it .
Humans can dig holes and make a well .
But dragonflies — a bit tricky .
There is no surface fresh water .
There are no ponds , streams , rivers , lakes , nothing like that .
So , why is it that every year millions of dragonflies , millions , millions of dragonflies turn up ?
I got a little bit curious . In fact I &apos;ll stop here , because I want to ask , and there is a lot of people who , from India of course , people who grew up spending your childhood here .
Those of you who are Indian or spent your childhood here , let me have a show of hands , who of you — not yet , not yet !
You &apos;re too keen . You &apos;re too keen . No . Hang on . Hang on .
Wait for the go . I &apos;ll say go .
Those of you who grew up in India , do you remember in your childhood , dragonflies , swarms of dragonflies ? Maybe at school , maybe tying little bits of string onto them ?
Maybe pulling bits off ? I &apos;m not asking about that .
You &apos;ve only got to say , do you remember seeing lots of dragonflies .
Any hands ? Any hands ? Yes . Thank you . Thank you .
It &apos;s a widespread phenomenon throughout South Asia , including the Maldives .
And I got a bit curious about it .
In the Maldives — now , in India there is plenty of water , so , dragonflies , yeah , of course . Why not ?
But in Maldives , no fresh water . So , what on Earth is going on ?
And the first thing I did was started recording when they turned up in the Maldives .
And there is the answer , 21st of October .
Not every year , that &apos;s the average date .
So , I &apos;ve been writing it down for 15 years now .
You &apos;d think they &apos;re coming from India . It &apos;s the closest place .
But in October , remember , we &apos;re still in southwest monsoon , Maldives is still in the southwest monsoon .
But wind is , invariably , every time , is from the west .
It &apos;s going towards India , not from India .
So , are these things , how are these things getting here ?
Are they coming from India against the wind ?
Seemed a bit unlikely .
So , next thing I did is I got on the phone .
Maldives is a long archipelago .
It stretches about 500 miles , of course it &apos;s India here .
I got on the phone and emailed to friends and colleagues .
When do you see the dragonflies appear ?
And pretty soon , a picture started emerging .
In Bangalore , a colleague there sent me information for three years , average , 24th of September , so late September .
Down in Trivandrum , a bit later .
Far north of Maldives , a bit later .
Then Malé , then further south .
And then the southernmost Maldives .
It &apos;s pretty obvious , they &apos;re coming from India .
But they are coming 400 miles across the ocean , against the wind .
How on Earth are they doing that ?
I didn &apos;t know .
The next thing I did was I started counting dragonflies .
I wanted to know about their seasonality , what time of year , this is when they first arrive , but how long are they around for ? Does that give any clues ?
So , I started a very rigorous scientific process .
I had a rigorous scientific transect .
I got on my bicycle , and I cycled around the island of Malé .
It &apos;s about five kilometers around , counting the dragonflies as I go , trying not to bump into people as I &apos;m looking in the trees .
And they &apos;re here for a very short time , October , November , December . That &apos;s it .
And then they tail off , there &apos;s a few , but that &apos;s it .
October , November , December . That is not the northeast monsoon season .
That &apos;s not the southwest season .
That &apos;s the inter-monsoon , the time when the monsoon changes .
Now , what I said was , you get the southwest monsoon going one way , and then it changes and you get the northeast monsoon going the other way .
And that sort of gives the impression you &apos;ve got one air mass going up and down , up and down . It doesn &apos;t work like that .
What happens , actually , is there is two air masses .
And there is a front between them , and the front moves .
So , if you &apos;ve got India here , when the front is up above India you &apos;re into the southwest monsoon .
Then the front moves into the northeast monsoon .
And that front in the middle is not vertical , it &apos;s at an angle .
So , as it comes over towards Malé I &apos;m standing in Malé underneath the front .
I can be in the southwest monsoon .
But the wind above is from the northeast monsoon .
So , the dragonflies are actually coming from India on the northeast monsoon , but at an altitude at 1,000 to 2,000 meters up in the air . Incredible .
These little insects , it &apos;s the same ones we see out here &#91; in India &#93; , two inches long , five centimeters long , flying in their millions , 400 miles across the ocean , at 2,000 meters up . Quite incredible .
So , I was quite pleased with myself . I thought wow , I &apos;ve tracked this one , I know how they come here . Then I scratched my head a bit , and that &apos;s okay , I know how they come here , but why do they come here ?
What are millions of dragonflies doing , flying out over the ocean every year to their apparent doom ?
It doesn &apos;t make sense . There is nothing for them in Maldives .
What on Earth are they doing ?
Well , to cut a long story short , they &apos;re actually flying right across the ocean .
They &apos;re making it all the way across to East Africa .
I know that because I have friends who work on fisheries &apos; research vessels who have sent to me reports from boats out in the ocean .
I know because we have reports from Seychelles , which fit in as well , down here .
And I know because when you look at the rainfall , these particular insects , these Globe Skimmers breed in temporary rain water pools .
Okay , they lay their eggs where the seasonal rains are , the monsoon rains .
The larvae have to develop very quickly .
They only take six weeks . Instead of 11 months , they &apos;re six weeks .
They &apos;re up , and they &apos;re off .
Now , here we have , in case you can &apos;t read at the back , the top is rainfall for India .
And we &apos;re starting in June . So this is the monsoon rain .
By September , October , it &apos;s drying out .
Nothing for these dragonflies . There is no more seasonal rain .
They &apos;ve got to go hunting for seasonal rain .
And they fly south . As the monsoon withdraws to the south they come down through Karnataka , into Kerala .
And then they run out of land .
But they are incredibly good fliers . This particular species , it can fly for thousands of kilometers .
And it just keeps going . And the wind , the northeast wind swooshes it around and carries it off across the ocean to Africa , where it &apos;s raining .
And they are breeding in the rains of Africa .
Now , this is southeast Africa . It makes it look like there are sort of two breeding periods here . It &apos;s slightly more complicated than that .
What &apos;s happening is they are breeding in the monsoon rains here .
And the dragonflies you can see today outside here , on the campus , are the young of this generation .
They hatched out in India .
They &apos;re looking for somewhere to breed . If it rains here they &apos;ll breed .
But most of them are going to carry on . And next stop , perhaps only four or five days away is going to be East Africa .
The wind will swoosh them out across here .
If they pass the Maldives they might go and have a look , nothing there , they &apos;ll carry on .
Here , here , Kenya , East Africa , they &apos;ve actually just come out of a long drought .
Just last week the rains broke . The short rains broke and it &apos;s raining there now .
And the dragonflies are there . I have reports from my various contacts .
The dragonflies are here now . They &apos;re breeding there .
When those guys , they &apos;ll lay their eggs now .
They &apos;ll hatch out in six weeks . By that time the seasonal rains have moved on . It &apos;s not there , it &apos;s down here .
They &apos;ll fly down here . And the clever thing is the wind is always converging to where the rain is .
The rain occurs , these are summer rains .
This is a summer monsoon .
The sun is overhead there . Summer rains in southern Africa .
The sun is overhead , maximum heating , maximum evaporation , maximum clouds , maximum rainfall , maximum opportunities for reproduction .
Not only that , because you have this convection , you have this rising of the air where it &apos;s hot , air is drawn in .
There &apos;s a convergence . So , wherever the rain is falling , the air is drawn towards it to replace the air that &apos;s rising .
So , the little fellow that hatches out here , he gets up into the air , he is automatically carried to where the rain is falling .
Lay their eggs , next generation , they come up , automatically carried to where the rain is falling .
It &apos;s now back there . They come out , it &apos;s time to come back .
So , in four generations , one , two , three , four and then back .
A complete circuit of the Indian Ocean .
This is a circuit of about 16,000 kilometers .
16,000 kilometers , four generations , mind you , for a two inch long insect . It &apos;s quite incredible .
Those of you from North America will be familiar with the Monarch butterfly .
Which , up until now has had the longest known insect migration .
It &apos;s only half the length of this one .
And this crossing here , of the ocean , is the only truly regular transoceanic crossing of any insect .
A quite incredible feat .
And I only stumbled on this because I was living in Malé , in Maldives for long enough for it to percolate into my brain that something rather special was going on .
But dragonflies are not the only creatures that make the crossing .
There is more to the story .
I &apos;m also interested in birds . And I &apos;m familiar with this fellow . This is a rather special bird .
It &apos;s a falcon . It &apos;s called the eastern red-footed falcon , obviously .
But it &apos;s also called the Amur Falcon .
And it &apos;s called the Amur Falcon because it breeds in Amurland .
Which is an area along the Amur River , which is up here .
It &apos;s the border , much of it is the border between China and Russia , up here in the far east .
So , Siberia , Manchuria .
And that &apos;s where it breeds .
And if you &apos;re a falcon it &apos;s quite a nice place to be in the summer .
But it &apos;s a pretty miserable place to be in the winter .
It &apos;s , well , you can imagine .
So , as any sensible bird would do , he moves south . They move south . The whole population moves south .
But then the being sensible stopped .
So , now they don &apos;t stop here , or even down here .
No , they turn across here .
They have a little refueling stop in northeastern India .
They come to the latitude of about Mumbai or Goa .
And then they strike out across the ocean , down to Kenya .
And down here , and they winter down here &#91; in southern Africa &#93; .
Incredible . This is the most extraordinary migration of any bird of prey . A quite incredible migration .
And they are not the only one that makes the crossing .
They have the most incredible journey , but several make the crossing from India to Africa . Includes this one , the hobby .
This fellow is a very nice bird , this is the Pied cuckoo .
Those of you from northern India will be familiar with this .
It comes with the monsoons .
This time of year they cross back to Africa .
And this guy , the roller , a rather beautiful bird .
It &apos;s known as the Eurasian Roller . In India it occurs in the northwest , so it &apos;s known as the Kashmir Roller .
And these birds , what I &apos;ve done is I &apos;ve complied all the records , all the available records of these birds , put them together , and found out they migrate at exactly the same time as the dragonflies .
They make use of exactly the same winds .
They travel at exactly the same time with the same winds to make the crossing . I know they travel at the same altitude .
It &apos;s known about the Amur Falcon . This guy , unfortunately , one of these met an unfortunate end .
He was flying off the coast of Goa , 21 years ago , 1988 . October , 1988 .
An Indian Navy jet was flying off Goa , bang ! In the middle of the night . Fortunately , a two engine jet got back to base , and they pulled the remains of one of these &#91; Eurasian Rollers &#93; out .
Flying at night over the Indian Ocean 2,424 meters .
Same height as the dragonflies go .
So , they are using the same winds .
And the other thing , the other important factor for all these birds , all medium sized fellows , and this includes the next slide as well , which is a bee-eater .
Bee-eaters eat bees . This one has a nice blue cheek .
It &apos;s a Blue-cheeked Bee-eater .
And every one of these birds that makes the crossing from India to East Africa eats insects , large insects , the size of dragonflies . Thank you very much .

I was one of the founding members of the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour .
And then there was me , the Iranian-American of the group .
My question is : Why would you take credit for a failed car bombing ?
And it &apos;s great , there &apos;s good people everywhere .
For example , I took my two-year-old son to the playground at the Dubai Mall .
Doesn &apos;t it feel good to say it out loud ?
Okay , it &apos;s great to be back at TED .
Why don &apos;t I just start by firing away with the video ?
( Music ) ( Video ) Man : Okay , Glass , record a video .
Woman : This is it . We &apos;re on in two minutes .
Man 2 : Okay Glass , hang out with The Flying Club .
Man 3 : Google &quot; &quot; photos of tiger heads . &quot; &quot; Hmm .
Man 4 : You ready ? You ready ? ( Barking ) Woman 2 : Right there . Okay , Glass , take a picture .
( Child shouting ) Man 5 : Go !
Man 6 : Holy &#91; beep &#93; ! That is awesome .
Child : Whoa ! Look at that snake !
Woman 3 : Okay , Glass , record a video !
Man 7 : After this bridge , first exit .
Man 8 : Okay , A12 , right there !
( Applause ) ( Children singing ) Man 9 : Google , say &quot; &quot; delicious &quot; &quot; in Thai .
Google Glass : อร ่ อยMan 9 : Mmm , อร ่ อย .
Woman 4 : Google &quot; &quot; jellyfish . &quot; &quot; ( Music ) Man 10 : It &apos;s beautiful .
( Applause ) Sergey Brin : Oh , sorry , I just got this message from a Nigerian prince .
He needs help getting 10 million dollars .
I like to pay attention to these because that &apos;s how we originally funded the company , and it &apos;s gone pretty well .
Though in all seriousness , this position that you just saw me in , looking down at my phone , that &apos;s one of the reasons behind this project , Project Glass .
Because we ultimately questioned whether this is the ultimate future of how you want to connect to other people in your life , how you want to connect to information .
Should it be by just walking around looking down ?
But that was the vision behind Glass , and that &apos;s why we &apos;ve created this form factor .
Okay . And I don &apos;t want to go through all the things it does and whatnot , but I want to tell you a little bit more about the motivation behind what led to it .
In addition to potentially socially isolating yourself when you &apos;re out and about looking at your phone , it &apos;s kind of , is this what you &apos;re meant to do with your body ?
You &apos;re standing around there and you &apos;re just rubbing this featureless piece of glass .
You &apos;re just kind of moving around .
So when we developed Glass , we thought really about , can we make something that frees your hands ?
You saw all of the things people are doing in the video back there .
They were all wearing Glass , and that &apos;s how we got that footage .
And also you want something that frees your eyes .
That &apos;s why we put the display up high , out of your line of sight , so it wouldn &apos;t be where you &apos;re looking and it wouldn &apos;t be where you &apos;re making eye contact with people .
And also we wanted to free up the ears , so the sound actually goes through , conducts straight to the bones in your cranium , which is a little bit freaky at first , but you get used to it .
And ironically , if you want to hear it better , you actually just cover your ear , which is kind of surprising , but that &apos;s how it works .
My vision when we started Google 15 years ago was that eventually you wouldn &apos;t have to have a search query at all .
You &apos;d just have information come to you as you needed it .
And this is now , 15 years later , sort of the first form factor that I think can deliver that vision when you &apos;re out and about on the street talking to people and so forth .
This project has lasted now , been just over two years .
We &apos;ve learned an amazing amount .
It &apos;s been really important to make it comfortable .
So our first prototypes we built were huge .
It was like cell phones strapped to your head .
It was very heavy , pretty uncomfortable .
We had to keep it secret from our industrial designer until she actually accepted the job , and then she almost ran away screaming .
But we &apos;ve come a long way .
And the other really unexpected surprise was the camera .
Our original prototypes didn &apos;t have cameras at all , but it &apos;s been really magical to be able to capture moments spent with my family , my kids .
I just never would have dug out a camera or a phone or something else to take that moment .
And lastly I &apos;ve realized , in experimenting with this device , that I also kind of have a nervous tic .
The cell phone is — yeah , you have to look down on it and all that , but it &apos;s also kind of a nervous habit .
Like if I smoked , I &apos;d probably just smoke instead .
I would just light up a cigarette . It would look cooler .
You know , I &apos;d be like — But in this case , you know , I whip this out and I sit there and look as if I have something very important to do or attend to .
But it really opened my eyes to how much of my life I spent just secluding away , be it email or social posts or whatnot , even though it wasn &apos;t really — there &apos;s nothing really that important or that pressing .
And with this , I know I will get certain messages if I really need them , but I don &apos;t have to be checking them all the time .
Yeah , I &apos;ve really enjoyed actually exploring the world more , doing more of the crazy things like you saw in the video .
Thank you all very much .
Back in New York , I am the head of development for a non-profit called Robin Hood .
When I &apos;m not fighting poverty , I &apos;m fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company .
Now in our town , where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff , you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action .
I remember my first fire .
I was the second volunteer on the scene , so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in .
But still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge to find out what our assignments would be .
When I found the captain , he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner , who was surely having one of the worst days of her life .
Here it was , the middle of the night , she was standing outside in the pouring rain , under an umbrella , in her pajamas , barefoot , while her house was in flames .
The other volunteer who had arrived just before me — let &apos;s call him Lex Luther — ( Laughter ) got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner &apos;s dog .
The dog ! I was stunned with jealousy .
Here was some lawyer or money manager who , for the rest of his life , gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature , just because he beat me by five seconds .
Well , I was next .
The captain waved me over .
He said , &quot; &quot; Bezos , I need you to go into the house .
I need you to go upstairs , past the fire , and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I swear .
So , not exactly what I was hoping for , but off I went — up the stairs , down the hall , past the &apos; real &apos; firefighters , who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point , into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes .
Now I know what you &apos;re thinking , but I &apos;m no hero .
( Laughter ) I carried my payload back downstairs where I met my nemesis and the precious dog by the front door .
We took our treasures outside to the homeowner , where , not surprisingly , his received much more attention than did mine .
A few weeks later , the department received a letter from the homeowner thanking us for the valiant effort displayed in saving her home .
The act of kindness she noted above all others : someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes .
( Laughter ) In both my vocation at Robin Hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter , I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale , but I &apos;m also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis .
And you know what I &apos;ve learned ?
They all matter .
So as I look around this room at people who either have achieved , or are on their way to achieving , remarkable levels of success , I would offer this reminder : don &apos;t wait .
Don &apos;t wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody &apos;s life .
If you have something to give , give it now .
Serve food at a soup kitchen . Clean up a neighborhood park .
Be a mentor .
Not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody &apos;s life , but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one .
So get in the game . Save the shoes .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Bruno Giussani : Mark , Mark , come back . ( Applause )
Mark Bezos : Thank you .
Now there is an epidemic of obesity : two-thirds of adults and 15 percent of kids . What &apos;s really concerning to me is that diabetes has increased 70 percent in the past 10 years , and this may be the first generation in which our kids live a shorter life span than we do . That &apos;s pitiful , and it &apos;s preventable .
But the people in Asia are starting to eat like we are , which is why they &apos;re starting to get sick like we are .
The salads that you see at McDonald &apos;s came from the work — they &apos;re going to have an Asian salad . At Pepsi , two-thirds of their revenue growth came from their better foods .
Good morning everyone . First of all , it &apos;s been fantastic being here over these past few days .
And secondly , I feel it &apos;s a great honor to kind of wind up this extraordinary gathering of people , these amazing talks that we &apos;ve had .
I feel that I &apos;ve fitted in , in many ways , to some of the things that I &apos;ve heard .
I came directly here from the deep , deep tropical rainforest in Ecuador , where I was out — you could only get there by a plane — with indigenous people with paint on their faces and parrot feathers on their headdresses , where these people are fighting to try and keep the oil companies , and keep the roads , out of their forests .
They &apos;re fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that &apos;s clean , a world that isn &apos;t contaminated , a world that isn &apos;t polluted .
And what was so amazing to me , and what fits right in with what we &apos;re all talking about here at TED , is that there , right in the middle of this rainforest , was some solar panels — the first in that part of Ecuador — and that was mainly to bring water up by pump so that the women wouldn &apos;t have to go down .
The water was cleaned , but because they got a lot of batteries , they were able to store a lot of electricity .
So every house — and there were , I think , eight houses in this little community — could have light for , I think it was about half an hour each evening .
And there is the Chief , in all his regal finery , with a laptop computer .
( Laughter ) And this man , he has been outside , but he &apos;s gone back , and he was saying , &quot; &quot; You know , we have suddenly jumped into a whole new era , and we didn &apos;t even know about the white man 50 years ago , and now here we are with laptop computers , and there are some things we want to learn from the modern world .
We want to know about health care .
We want to know about what other people do — we &apos;re interested in it .
And we want to learn other languages .
We want to know English and French and perhaps Chinese , and we &apos;re good at languages . &quot; &quot; So there he is with his little laptop computer , but fighting against the might of the pressures — because of the debt , the foreign debt of Ecuador — fighting the pressure of World Bank , IMF , and of course the people who want to exploit the forests and take out the oil .
And so , coming directly from there to here .
But , of course , my real field of expertise lies in an even different kind of civilization — I can &apos;t really call it a civilization .
A different way of life , a different being .
We &apos;ve talked earlier — this wonderful talk by Wade Davis about the different cultures of the humans around the world — but the world is not composed only of human beings ; there are also other animal beings .
And I propose to bring into this TED conference , as I always do around the world , the voice of the animal kingdom .
Too often we just see a few slides , or a bit of film , but these beings have voices that mean something .
And so , I want to give you a greeting , as from a chimpanzee in the forests of Tanzania — Ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh !
( Applause ) I &apos;ve been studying chimpanzees in Tanzania since 1960 .
During that time , there have been modern technologies that have really transformed the way that field biologists do their work .
For example , for the first time , a few years ago , by simply collecting little fecal samples we were able to have them analyzed — to have DNA profiling done — so for the first time , we actually know which male chimps are the fathers of each individual infant .
Because the chimps have a very promiscuous mating society .
So this opens up a whole new avenue of research .
And we use GSI — geographic whatever it is , GSI — to determine the range of the chimps .
And we &apos;re using — you can see that I &apos;m not really into this kind of stuff — but we &apos;re using satellite imagery to look at the deforestation in the area .
And of course , there &apos;s developments in infrared , so you can watch animals at night , and equipment for recording by video , and tape recording is getting lighter and better .
So in many , many ways , we can do things today that we couldn &apos;t do when I began in 1960 .
Especially when chimpanzees , and other animals with large brains , are studied in captivity , modern technology is helping us to search for the upper levels of cognition in some of these non-human animals .
So that we know today , they &apos;re capable of performances that would have been thought absolutely impossible by science when I began .
I think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled in intellectual performance is one called Ai in Japan — her name means love — and she has a wonderfully sensitive partner working with her .
She loves her computer — she &apos;ll leave her big group , and her running water , and her trees and everything .
And she &apos;ll come in to sit at this computer — it &apos;s like a video game for a kid ; she &apos;s hooked .
She &apos;s 28 , by the way , and she does things with her computer screen and a touch pad that she can do faster than most humans .
She does very complex tasks , and I haven &apos;t got time to go into them , but the amazing thing about this female is she doesn &apos;t like making mistakes .
If she has a bad run , and her score isn &apos;t good , she &apos;ll come and reach up and tap on the glass — because she can &apos;t see the experimenter — which is asking to have another go .
And her concentration — she &apos;s already concentrated hard for 20 minutes or so , and now she wants to do it all over again , just for the satisfaction of having done it better .
And the food is not important — she does get a tiny reward , like one raisin for a correct response — but she will do it for nothing , if you tell her beforehand .
So here we are , a chimpanzee using a computer .
Chimpanzees , gorillas , orangutans also learn human sign language .
But the point is that when I was first in Gombe in 1960 — I remember so well , so vividly , as though it was yesterday — the first time , when I was going through the vegetation , the chimpanzees were still running away from me , for the most part , although some were a little bit acclimatized — and I saw this dark shape , hunched over a termite mound , and I peered with my binoculars .
It was , fortunately , one adult male whom I &apos;d named David Greybeard — and by the way , science at that time was telling me that I shouldn &apos;t name the chimps ; they should all have numbers ; that was more scientific .
Anyway , David Greybeard — and I saw that he was picking little pieces of grass and using them to fish termites from their underground nest .
And not only that — he would sometimes pick a leafy twig and strip the leaves — modifying an object to make it suitable for a specific purpose — the beginning of tool-making .
The reason this was so exciting and such a breakthrough is at that time , it was thought that humans , and only humans , used and made tools .
When I was at school , we were defined as man , the toolmaker .
So that when Louis Leakey , my mentor , heard this news , he said , &quot; &quot; Ah , we must now redefine &apos; man , &apos; redefine &apos; tool , &apos; or accept chimpanzees as humans . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We now know that at Gombe alone , there are nine different ways in which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes .
Moreover , we know that in different parts of Africa , wherever chimps have been studied , there are completely different tool-using behaviors .
And because it seems that these patterns are passed from one generation to the next , through observation , imitation and practice — that is a definition of human culture .
What we find is that over these 40-odd years that I and others have been studying chimpanzees and the other great apes , and , as I say , other mammals with complex brains and social systems , we have found that after all , there isn &apos;t a sharp line dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom .
It &apos;s a very wuzzy line .
It &apos;s getting wuzzier all the time as we find animals doing things that we , in our arrogance , used to think was just human .
The chimps — there &apos;s no time to discuss their fascinating lives — but they have this long childhood , five years of suckling and sleeping with the mother , and then another three , four or five years of emotional dependence on her , even when the next child is born .
The importance of learning in that time , when behavior is flexible — and there &apos;s an awful lot to learn in chimpanzee society .
The long-term affectionate supportive bonds that develop throughout this long childhood with the mother , with the brothers and sisters , and which can last through a lifetime , which may be up to 60 years .
They can actually live longer than 60 in captivity , so we &apos;ve only done 40 years in the wild so far .
And we find chimps are capable of true compassion and altruism .
We find in their non-verbal communication — this is very rich — they have a lot of sounds , which they use in different circumstances , but they also use touch , posture , gesture , and what do they do ?
They kiss ; they embrace ; they hold hands .
They pat one another on the back ; they swagger ; they shake their fist — the kind of things that we do , and they do them in the same kind of context .
They have very sophisticated cooperation .
Sometimes they hunt — not that often , but when they hunt , they show sophisticated cooperation , and they share the prey .
We find that they show emotions , similar to — maybe sometimes the same — as those that we describe in ourselves as happiness , sadness , fear , despair .
They know mental as well as physical suffering .
And I don &apos;t have time to go into the information that will prove some of these things to you , save to say that there are very bright students , in the best universities , studying emotions in animals , studying personalities in animals .
We know that chimpanzees and some other creatures can recognize themselves in mirrors — &quot; &quot; self &quot; &quot; as opposed to &quot; &quot; other . &quot; &quot; They have a sense of humor , and these are the kind of things which traditionally have been thought of as human prerogatives .
But this teaches us a new respect — and it &apos;s a new respect not only for the chimpanzees , I suggest , but some of the other amazing animals with whom we share this planet .
Once we &apos;re prepared to admit that after all , we &apos;re not the only beings with personalities , minds and above all feelings , and then we start to think about ways we use and abuse so many other sentient , sapient creatures on this planet , it really gives cause for deep shame , at least for me .
So , the sad thing is that these chimpanzees — who &apos;ve perhaps taught us , more than any other creature , a little humility — are in the wild , disappearing very fast .
They &apos;re disappearing for the reasons that all of you in this room know only too well .
The deforestation , the growth of human populations , needing more land .
They &apos;re disappearing because some timber companies go in with clear-cutting .
They &apos;re disappearing in the heart of their range in Africa because the big multinational logging companies have come in and made roads — as they want to do in Ecuador and other parts where the forests remain untouched — to take out oil or timber .
And this has led in Congo basin , and other parts of the world , to what is known as the bush-meat trade .
This means that although for hundreds , perhaps thousands of years , people have lived in those forests , or whatever habitat it is , in harmony with their world , just killing the animals they need for themselves and their families — now , suddenly , because of the roads , the hunters can go in from the towns .
They shoot everything , every single thing that moves that &apos;s bigger than a small rat ; they sun-dry it or smoke it .
And now they &apos;ve got transport ; they take it on the logging trucks or the mining trucks into the towns where they sell it .
And people will pay more for bush-meat , as it &apos;s called , than for domestic meat — it &apos;s culturally preferred .
And it &apos;s not sustainable , and the huge logging camps in the forest are now demanding meat , so the Pygmy hunters in the Congo basin who &apos;ve lived there with their wonderful way of living for so many hundreds of years are now corrupted .
They &apos;re given weapons ; they shoot for the logging camps ; they get money .
Their culture is being destroyed , along with the animals upon whom they depend .
So , when the logging camp moves , there &apos;s nothing left .
We talked already about the loss of human cultural diversity , and I &apos;ve seen it happening with my own eyes .
And the grim picture in Africa — I love Africa , and what do we see in Africa ?
We see deforestation ; we see the desert spreading ; we see massive hunger ; we see disease and we see population growth in areas where there are more people living on a certain piece of land than the land can possibly support , and they &apos;re too poor to buy food from elsewhere .
Were the people that we heard about yesterday , on the Easter Island , who cut down their last tree — were they stupid ?
Didn &apos;t they know what was happening ?
Of course , but if you &apos;ve seen the crippling poverty in some of these parts of the world it isn &apos;t a question of &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s leave the tree for tomorrow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How am I going to feed my family today ?
Maybe I can get just a few dollars from this last tree which will keep us going a little bit longer , and then we &apos;ll pray that something will happen to save us from the inevitable end . &quot; &quot; So , this is a pretty grim picture .
The one thing we have , which makes us so different from chimpanzees or other living creatures , is this sophisticated spoken language — a language with which we can tell children about things that aren &apos;t here .
We can talk about the distant past , plan for the distant future , discuss ideas with each other , so that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group .
We can do it by talking to each other ; we can do it through video ; we can do it through the written word .
And we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards , and we &apos;re destroying the world .
In the developed world , in a way , it &apos;s worse , because we have so much access to knowledge of the stupidity of what we &apos;re doing .
Do you know , we &apos;re bringing little babies into a world where , in many places , the water is poisoning them ?
And the air is harming them , and the food that &apos;s grown from the contaminated land is poisoning them .
And that &apos;s not just in the far-away developing world ; that &apos;s everywhere .
Do you know we all have about 50 chemicals in our bodies we didn &apos;t have about 50 years ago ?
And so many of these diseases , like asthma and certain kinds of cancers , are on the increase around places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped .
We &apos;re harming ourselves around the world , as well as harming the animals , as well as harming nature herself — Mother Nature , that brought us into being ; Mother Nature , where I believe we need to spend time , where there &apos;s trees and flowers and birds for our good psychological development .
And yet , there are hundreds and hundreds of children in the developed world who never see nature , because they &apos;re growing up in concrete and all they know is virtual reality , with no opportunity to go and lie in the sun , or in the forest , with the dappled sun-specks coming down from the canopy above .
As I was traveling around the world , you know , I had to leave the forest — that &apos;s where I love to be .
I had to leave these fascinating chimpanzees for my students and field staff to continue studying because , finding they dwindled from about two million 100 years ago to about 150,000 now , I knew I had to leave the forest to do what I could to raise awareness around the world .
And the more I talked about the chimpanzees &apos; plight , the more I realized the fact that everything &apos;s interconnected , and the problems of the developing world so often stem from the greed of the developed world , and everything was joining together , and making — not sense , hope lies in sense , you said — it &apos;s making a nonsense .
How can we do it ?
Somebody said that yesterday .
And as I was traveling around , I kept meeting young people who &apos;d lost hope .
They were feeling despair , they were feeling , &quot; &quot; Well , it doesn &apos;t matter what we do ; eat , drink and be merry , for tomorrow we die .
Everything is hopeless — we &apos;re always being told so by the media . &quot; &quot; And then I met some who were angry , and anger that can turn to violence , and we &apos;re all familiar with that .
And I have three little grandchildren , and when some of these students would say to me at high school or university , they &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re angry , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; We &apos;re filled with despair , because we feel you &apos;ve compromised our future , and there &apos;s nothing we can do about it . &quot; &quot; And I looked in the eyes of my little grandchildren , and think how much we &apos;ve harmed this planet since I was their age .
I feel this deep shame , and that &apos;s why in 1991 in Tanzania , I started a program that &apos;s called Roots and Shoots .
There &apos;s little brochures all around outside , and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future , I beg that you pick up that brochure .
And Roots and Shoots is a program for hope .
Roots make a firm foundation .
Shoots seem tiny , but to reach the sun they can break through brick walls .
See the brick walls as all the problems that we &apos;ve inflicted on this planet .
Then , you see , it is a message of hope .
Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through , and can make this a better world .
And the most important message of Roots and Shoots is that every single individual makes a difference .
Every individual has a role to play .
Every one of us impacts the world around us everyday , and you scientists know that you can &apos;t actually — even if you stay in bed all day , you &apos;re breathing oxygen and giving out CO2 , and probably going to the loo , and things like that — you &apos;re making a difference in the world .
So , the Roots and Shoots program involves youth in three kinds of projects .
And these are projects to make the world around them a better place .
One project to show care and concern for your own human community .
One for animals , including domestic animals — and I have to say , I learned everything I know about animal behavior even before I got to Gombe and the chimps from my dog , Rusty , who was my childhood companion .
And the third kind of project : something for the local environment .
So what the kids do depends first of all , how old are they — and we go now from pre-school right through university .
It &apos;s going to depend whether they &apos;re inner-city or rural .
It &apos;s going to depend if they &apos;re wealthy or impoverished .
It &apos;s going to depend which part , say , of America they &apos;re in .
We &apos;re in every state now , and the problems in Florida are different from the problems in New York .
It &apos;s going to depend on which country they &apos;re in — and we &apos;re already in 60-plus countries , with about 5,000 active groups — and there are groups all over the place that I keep hearing about that I &apos;ve never even heard of , because the kids are taking the program and spreading it themselves .
Why ?
Because they &apos;re buying into it , and they &apos;re the ones who get to decide what they &apos;re going to do .
It isn &apos;t something that their parents tell them , or their teachers tell them .
That &apos;s effective , but if they decide themselves , &quot; &quot; We want to clean this river and put the fish back that used to be there .
We want to clear away the toxic soil from this area and have an organic garden .
We want to go and spend time with the old people and hear their stories and record their oral histories .
We want to go and work in a dog shelter .
We want to learn about animals . We want ... &quot; &quot; You know , it goes on and on , and this is very hopeful for me .
As I travel around the world 300 days a year , everywhere there &apos;s a group of Roots and Shoots of different ages .
Everywhere there are children with shining eyes saying , &quot; Look at the difference we &apos;ve made . &quot;
And now comes the technology into it , because with this new way of communicating electronically these kids can communicate with each other around the world .
And if anyone is interested to help us , we &apos;ve got so many ideas but we need help — we need help to create the right kind of system that will help these young people to communicate their excitement .
But also — and this is so important — to communicate their despair , to say , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve tried this and it doesn &apos;t work , and what shall we do ? &quot; &quot; And then , lo and behold , there &apos;s another group answering these kids who may be in America , or maybe this is a group in Israel , saying , &quot; &quot; Yeah , you did it a little bit wrong . This is how you should do it . &quot; &quot; The philosophy is very simple .
We do not believe in violence .
No violence , no bombs , no guns .
That &apos;s not the way to solve problems .
Violence leads to violence , at least in my view .
So how do we solve ?
The tools for solving the problems are knowledge and understanding .
Know the facts , but see how they fit in the big picture .
Hard work and persistence — don &apos;t give up — and love and compassion leading to respect for all life .
How many more minutes ? Two , one ?
Chris Anderson : One — one to two .
Jane Goodall : Two , two , I &apos;m going to take two .
( Laughter ) Are you going to come and drag me off ? ( Laughter )
Anyway — so basically , Roots and Shoots is beginning to change young people &apos;s lives .
It &apos;s what I &apos;m devoting most of my energy to .
And I believe that a group like this can have a very major impact , not just because you can share technology with us , but because so many of you have children .
And if you take this program out , and give it to your children , they have such a good opportunity to go out and do good , because they &apos;ve got parents like you .
And it &apos;s been so clear how much you all care about trying to make this world a better place .
It &apos;s very encouraging .
But the kids do ask me — and this won &apos;t take more than two minutes , I promise — the kids say , &quot; &quot; Dr. Jane , do you really have hope for the future ?
You travel , you see all these horrible things happening . &quot; &quot; Firstly , the human brain — I don &apos;t need to say anything about that .
Now that we know what the problems are around the world , human brains like yours are rising to solve those problems .
And we &apos;ve talked a lot about that .
Secondly , the resilience of nature .
We can destroy a river , and we can bring it back to life .
We can see a whole area desolated , and it can be brought back to bloom again , with time or a little help .
And thirdly , the last speaker talked about — or the speaker before last , talked about the indomitable human spirit .
We are surrounded by the most amazing people who do things that seem to be absolutely impossible .
Nelson Mandela — I take a little piece of limestone from Robben Island Prison , where he labored for 27 years , and came out with so little bitterness , he could lead his people from the horror of apartheid without a bloodbath .
Even after the 11th of September — and I was in New York and I felt the fear — nevertheless , there was so much human courage , so much love and so much compassion .
And then as I went around the country after that and felt the fear — the fear that was leading to people feeling they couldn &apos;t worry about the environment any more , in case they seemed not to be patriotic — and I was trying to encourage them , somebody came up with a little quotation from Mahatma Gandhi , &quot; &quot; If you look back through human history , you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good . &quot; &quot; And just after that a woman brought me this little bell , and I want to end on this note .
She said , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re talking about hope and peace , ring this .
This bell is made from metal from a defused landmine , from the killing fields of Pol Pot — one of the most evil regimes in human history — where people are now beginning to put their lives back together after the regime has crumbled .
So , yes , there is hope , and where is the hope ?
Is it out there with the politicians ?
It &apos;s in our hands .
It &apos;s in your hands and my hands and those of our children .
It &apos;s really up to us .
We &apos;re the ones who can make a difference .
If we lead lives where we consciously leave the lightest possible ecological footprints , if we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy and don &apos;t buy the things that are not , we can change the world overnight .
Thank you .
So I thought , &quot; &quot; I will talk about death . &quot; &quot; Seemed to be the passion today .
Actually , it &apos;s not about death .
It &apos;s inevitable , terrible , but really what I want to talk about is , I &apos;m just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die .
So Art Buchwald left his legacy of humor with a video that appeared soon after he died , saying , &quot; Hi ! I &apos;m Art Buchwald , and I just died . &quot;
And Mike , who I met at Galapagos , a trip which I won at TED , is leaving notes on cyberspace where he is chronicling his journey through cancer .
And my father left me a legacy of his handwriting through letters and a notebook .
In the last two years of his life , when he was sick , he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me .
He wrote about my strengths , weaknesses , and gentle suggestions for improvement , quoting specific incidents , and held a mirror to my life .
After he died , I realized that no one writes to me anymore .
Handwriting is a disappearing art .
I &apos;m all for email and thinking while typing , but why give up old habits for new ?
Why can &apos;t we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives ?
There are times when I want to trade all those years that I was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him , and trade all those years for one hug .
But too late .
But that &apos;s when I take out his letters and I read them , and the paper that touched his hand is in mine , and I feel connected to him .
So maybe we all need to leave our children with a value legacy , and not a financial one .
A value for things with a personal touch — an autographed book , a soul-searching letter .
If a fraction of this powerful TED audience could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper — John , it &apos;ll be a recycled one — and write a beautiful letter to someone they love , we actually may start a revolution where our children may go to penmanship classes .
So what do I plan to leave for my son ?
I plan to publish my own notebook .
As I witnessed my father &apos;s body being swallowed by fire , I sat by his funeral pyre and wrote .
I have no idea how I &apos;m going to do it , but I am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine into a book , and leave that published book for my son .
I &apos;d like to end with a few verses of what I wrote at my father &apos;s cremation .
And those linguists , please pardon the grammar , because I &apos;ve not looked at it in the last 10 years .
I took it out for the first time to come here .
&quot; &quot; Picture in a frame , ashes in a bottle , boundless energy confined in the bottle , forcing me to deal with reality , forcing me to deal with being grown up .
I hear you and I know that you would want me to be strong , but right now , I am being sucked down , surrounded and suffocated by these raging emotional waters , craving to cleanse my soul , trying to emerge on a firm footing one more time , to keep on fighting and flourishing just as you taught me .
Your encouraging whispers in my whirlpool of despair , holding me and heaving me to shores of sanity , to live again and to love again . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
Well , we all need a reason to wake up .
For me , it just took 11,000 volts .
One night , sophomore year of college , just back from Thanksgiving holiday , a few of my friends and I were horsing around , and we decided to climb atop a parked commuter train .
It was just sitting there , with the wires that run overhead .
Somehow , that seemed like a great idea at the time .
We &apos;d certainly done stupider things .
I scurried up the ladder on the back , and when I stood up , the electrical current entered my arm , blew down and out my feet , and that was that .
Would you believe that watch still works ?
Takes a licking !
( Laughter ) My father wears it now in solidarity .
That night began my formal relationship with death — my death — and it also began my long run as a patient .
It &apos;s a good word .
It means one who suffers .
So I guess we &apos;re all patients .
Now , the American health care system has more than its fair share of dysfunction — to match its brilliance , to be sure .
I &apos;m a physician now , a hospice and palliative medicine doc , so I &apos;ve seen care from both sides .
And believe me : almost everyone who goes into healthcare really means well — I mean , truly .
But we who work in it are also unwitting agents for a system that too often does not serve .
Why ?
Well , there &apos;s actually a pretty easy answer to that question , and it explains a lot : because healthcare was designed with diseases , not people , at its center .
Which is to say , of course , it was badly designed .
And nowhere are the effects of bad design more heartbreaking or the opportunity for good design more compelling than at the end of life , where things are so distilled and concentrated .
There are no do-overs .
My purpose today is to reach out across disciplines and invite design thinking into this big conversation .
That is , to bring intention and creativity to the experience of dying .
We have a monumental opportunity in front of us , before one of the few universal issues as individuals as well as a civil society : to rethink and redesign how it is we die .
So let &apos;s begin at the end .
For most people , the scariest thing about death isn &apos;t being dead , it &apos;s dying , suffering .
It &apos;s a key distinction .
To get underneath this , it can be very helpful to tease out suffering which is necessary as it is , from suffering we can change .
The former is a natural , essential part of life , part of the deal , and to this we are called to make space , adjust , grow .
It can be really good to realize forces larger than ourselves .
They bring proportionality , like a cosmic right-sizing .
After my limbs were gone , that loss , for example , became fact , fixed — necessarily part of my life , and I learned that I could no more reject this fact than reject myself .
It took me a while , but I learned it eventually .
This , we are finally realizing , is where healing happens .
Yes , compassion — literally , as we learned yesterday — suffering together .
Now , on the systems side , on the other hand , so much of the suffering is unnecessary , invented .
It serves no good purpose .
But the good news is , since this brand of suffering is made up , well , we can change it .
How we die is indeed something we can affect .
Making the system sensitive to this fundamental distinction between necessary and unnecessary suffering gives us our first of three design cues for the day .
After all , our role as caregivers , as people who care , is to relieve suffering — not add to the pile .
True to the tenets of palliative care , I function as something of a reflective advocate , as much as prescribing physician .
Quick aside : palliative care — a very important field but poorly understood — while it includes , it is not limited to end of life care .
It is not limited to hospice .
It &apos;s simply about comfort and living well at any stage .
Now , let me introduce you to Frank .
Sort of makes this point .
I &apos;ve been seeing Frank now for years .
He &apos;s living with advancing prostate cancer on top of long-standing HIV .
We work on his bone pain and his fatigue , but most of the time we spend thinking out loud together about his life — really , about our lives .
In this way , Frank grieves .
In this way , he keeps up with his losses as they roll in , so that he &apos;s ready to take in the next moment .
Loss is one thing , but regret , quite another .
Frank has always been an adventurer — he looks like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting — and no fan of regret .
So it wasn &apos;t surprising when he came into clinic one day , saying he wanted to raft down the Colorado River .
Was this a good idea ?
With all the risks to his safety and his health , some would say no .
Many did , but he went for it , while he still could .
It was a glorious , marvelous trip : freezing water , blistering dry heat , scorpions , snakes , wildlife howling off the flaming walls of the Grand Canyon — all the glorious side of the world beyond our control .
Frank &apos;s decision , while maybe dramatic , is exactly the kind so many of us would make , if we only had the support to figure out what is best for ourselves over time .
So much of what we &apos;re talking about today is a shift in perspective .
Studying visual art , I figured I &apos;d learn something about how to see — a really potent lesson for a kid who couldn &apos;t change so much of what he was seeing .
Perspective , that kind of alchemy we humans get to play with , turning anguish into a flower .
Flash forward : now I work at an amazing place in San Francisco called the Zen Hospice Project , where we have a little ritual that helps with this shift in perspective .
When one of our residents dies , the mortuary men come , and as we &apos;re wheeling the body out through the garden , heading for the gate , we pause .
Anyone who wants — fellow residents , family , nurses , volunteers , the hearse drivers too , now — shares a story or a song or silence , as we sprinkle the body with flower petals .
It takes a few minutes ; it &apos;s a sweet , simple parting image to usher in grief with warmth , rather than repugnance .
Cleaning crew swoops in , the body &apos;s whisked away , and it all feels as though that person had never really existed .
I revere hospitals for what they can do ; I am alive because of them .
But we ask too much of our hospitals .
They are places for acute trauma and treatable illness .
They are no place to live and die ; that &apos;s not what they were designed for .
Now mind you — I am not giving up on the notion that our institutions can become more humane .
Beauty can be found anywhere .
I spent a few months in a burn unit at St. Barnabas Hospital in Livingston , New Jersey , where I got really great care at every turn , including good palliative care for my pain .
And one night , it began to snow outside .
I remember my nurses complaining about driving through it .
And there was no window in my room , but it was great to just imagine it coming down all sticky .
Next day , one of my nurses smuggled in a snowball for me .
She brought it in to the unit .
I cannot tell you the rapture I felt holding that in my hand , and the coldness dripping onto my burning skin ; the miracle of it all , the fascination as I watched it melt and turn into water .
In that moment , just being any part of this planet in this universe mattered more to me than whether I lived or died .
In a hospital , that &apos;s a stolen moment .
In my work over the years , I &apos;ve known many people who were ready to go , ready to die .
Not because they had found some final peace or transcendence , but because they were so repulsed by what their lives had become — in a word , cut off , or ugly .
And we are nowhere near ready or prepared for this silver tsunami .
We need an infrastructure dynamic enough to handle these seismic shifts in our population .
Now is the time to create something new , something vital .
I know we can because we have to .
The alternative is just unacceptable .
And the key ingredients are known : policy , education and training , systems , bricks and mortar .
We have tons of input for designers of all stripes to work with .
We know , for example , from research what &apos;s most important to people who are closer to death : comfort ; feeling unburdened and unburdening to those they love ; existential peace ; and a sense of wonderment and spirituality .
Over Zen Hospice &apos;s nearly 30 years , we &apos;ve learned much more from our residents in subtle detail .
Little things aren &apos;t so little .
Take Janette .
She finds it harder to breathe one day to the next due to ALS .
Well , guess what ?
She wants to start smoking again — and French cigarettes , if you please .
Priorities change .
Or Kate — she just wants to know her dog Austin is lying at the foot of her bed , his cold muzzle against her dry skin , instead of more chemotherapy coursing through her veins — she &apos;s done that .
Sensuous , aesthetic gratification , where in a moment , in an instant , we are rewarded for just being .
So much of it comes down to loving our time by way of the senses , by way of the body — the very thing doing the living and the dying .
Probably the most poignant room in the Zen Hospice guest house is our kitchen , which is a little strange when you realize that so many of our residents can eat very little , if anything at all .
But we realize we are providing sustenance on several levels : smell , a symbolic plane .
Seriously , with all the heavy-duty stuff happening under our roof , one of the most tried and true interventions we know of , is to bake cookies .
Imagine the ripples of this notion for the millions of people living and dying with dementia .
Primal sensorial delights that say the things we don &apos;t have words for , impulses that make us stay present — no need for a past or a future .
So , if teasing unnecessary suffering out of the system was our first design cue , then tending to dignity by way of the senses , by way of the body — the aesthetic realm — is design cue number two .
Now this gets us quickly to the third and final bit for today ; namely , we need to lift our sights , to set our sights on well-being , so that life and health and healthcare can become about making life more wonderful , rather than just less horrible .
Beneficence .
Here , this gets right at the distinction between a disease-centered and a patient- or human-centered model of care , and here is where caring becomes a creative , generative , even playful act .
&quot; &quot; Play &quot; &quot; may sound like a funny word here .
But it is also one of our highest forms of adaptation .
Consider every major compulsory effort it takes to be human .
The need for food has birthed cuisine .
The need for shelter has given rise to architecture .
The need for cover , fashion .
And for being subjected to the clock , well , we invented music .
So , since dying is a necessary part of life , what might we create with this fact ?
By &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; I am in no way suggesting we take a light approach to dying or that we mandate any particular way of dying .
There are mountains of sorrow that cannot move , and one way or another , we will all kneel there .
Rather , I am asking that we make space — physical , psychic room , to allow life to play itself all the way out — so that rather than just getting out of the way , aging and dying can become a process of crescendo through to the end .
We can &apos;t solve for death .
I know some of you are working on this .
Parts of me died early on , and that &apos;s something we can all say one way or another .
I got to redesign my life around this fact , and I tell you it has been a liberation to realize you can always find a shock of beauty or meaning in what life you have left , like that snowball lasting for a perfect moment , all the while melting away .
If we love such moments ferociously , then maybe we can learn to live well — not in spite of death , but because of it .
Let death be what takes us , not lack of imagination .
Thank you .

And it comes out in January , and I hope you all buy it in triplicate .
And Howard is very interested in measuring things .
Howard is not so easily placated .
Howard is a man of a certain degree of intellectual standards .
This was one of the most brilliant breakthroughs in all of food science .
And finally , he had a breakthrough .
And this was even more important .
And then he analyzed the data .
Let &apos;s see if they congregate around certain ideas .
Now why is that important ?
Used to be , there were two mustards : French &apos;s and Gulden &apos;s .
Italian tomato sauce is what ?
I guess my cancer different from your cancer .
And for that , we owe him a great vote of thanks .
And the example he used was coffee .
What you &apos;re doing , right now , at this very moment , is killing you .
More than cars or the Internet or even that little mobile device we keep talking about , the technology you &apos;re using the most almost every day is this , your tush .
Nowadays people are sitting 9.3 hours a day , which is more than we &apos;re sleeping , at 7.7 hours .
Sitting is so incredibly prevalent , we don &apos;t even question how much we &apos;re doing it , and because everyone else is doing it , it doesn &apos;t even occur to us that it &apos;s not okay .
In that way , sitting has become the smoking of our generation .
Of course there &apos;s health consequences to this , scary ones , besides the waist .
Things like breast cancer and colon cancer are directly tied to our lack of physical &#91; activity &#93; , Ten percent in fact , on both of those .
Six percent for heart disease , seven percent for type 2 diabetes , which is what my father died of .
Now , any of those stats should convince each of us to get off our duff more , but if you &apos;re anything like me , it won &apos;t .
What did get me moving was a social interaction .
Someone invited me to a meeting , but couldn &apos;t manage to fit me in to a regular sort of conference room meeting , and said , &quot; I have to walk my dogs tomorrow . Could you come then ? &quot;
It seemed kind of odd to do , and actually , that first meeting , I remember thinking , &quot; I have to be the one to ask the next question , &quot; because I knew I was going to huff and puff during this conversation .
And yet , I &apos;ve taken that idea and made it my own .
So instead of going to coffee meetings or fluorescent-lit conference room meetings , I ask people to go on a walking meeting , to the tune of 20 to 30 miles a week .
It &apos;s changed my life .
But before that , what actually happened was , I used to think about it as , you could take care of your health , or you could take care of obligations , and one always came at the cost of the other .
So now , several hundred of these walking meetings later , I &apos;ve learned a few things .
First , there &apos;s this amazing thing about actually getting out of the box that leads to out-of-the-box thinking .
Whether it &apos;s nature or the exercise itself , it certainly works .
And second , and probably the more reflective one , is just about how much each of us can hold problems in opposition when they &apos;re really not that way .
And if we &apos;re going to solve problems and look at the world really differently , whether it &apos;s in governance or business or environmental issues , job creation , maybe we can think about how to reframe those problems as having both things be true .
Because it was when that happened with this walk-and-talk idea that things became doable and sustainable and viable .
So I started this talk talking about the tush , so I &apos;ll end with the bottom line , which is , walk and talk .
Walk the talk .
You &apos;ll be surprised at how fresh air drives fresh thinking , and in the way that you do , you &apos;ll bring into your life an entirely new set of ideas .
Thank you .

We live in an incredibly busy world .
The pace of life is often frantic , our minds are always busy , and we &apos;re always doing something .
So with that in mind , I &apos;d like you just to take a moment to think , when did you last take any time to do nothing ?
I see a lot of very blank faces .
This is the same mind that we depend upon to be focused , creative , spontaneous , and to perform at our very best in everything that we do .
We miss out on the things that are most important to us , and the crazy thing is that everybody just assumes , that &apos;s the way life is , so we &apos;ve just kind of got to get on with it .
So I was about 11 when I went along to my first meditation class .
You get stressed , you do some meditation .
Others will turn to their friends , their family , looking for support .
People often ask me what I learned from that time .
Well , obviously it changed things .
We need an exercise .
It &apos;s a very uncomfortable way to live life , when you get this tight and stressed .
If you think about the last time you had a wobbly tooth .
You know it &apos;s wobbly , and you know that it hurts .
But what do you do every 20 , 30 seconds ?
And we just keep telling ourselves , and we do it all the time .
I &apos;m going to talk about consciousness .
Why consciousness ?
Well , it &apos;s a curiously neglected subject , both in our scientific and our philosophical culture .
Now why is that curious ?
Well , it is the most important aspect of our lives for a very simple , logical reason , namely , it &apos;s a necessary condition on anything being important in our lives that we &apos;re conscious .
You care about science , philosophy , music , art , whatever — it &apos;s no good if you &apos;re a zombie or in a coma , right ?
So consciousness is number one .
The second reason is that when people do get interested in it , as I think they should , they tend to say the most appalling things .
When I first got interested in this , I thought , well , it &apos;s a straightforward problem in biology .
Let &apos;s get these brain stabbers to get busy and figure out how it works in the brain .
I think now you might actually get tenure by working on consciousness .
Okay , now why then is this curious reluctance and curious hostility to consciousness ?
Well , I think it &apos;s a combination of two features of our intellectual culture that like to think they &apos;re opposing each other but in fact they share a common set of assumptions .
One feature is the tradition of religious dualism : Consciousness is not a part of the physical world .
It &apos;s a part of the spiritual world .
It belongs to the soul , and the soul is not a part of the physical world .
That &apos;s the tradition of God , the soul and immortality .
There &apos;s another tradition that thinks it &apos;s opposed to this but accepts the worst assumption .
That tradition thinks that we are heavy-duty scientific materialists : Consciousness is not a part of the physical world .
Either it doesn &apos;t exist at all , or it &apos;s something else , a computer program or some damn fool thing , but in any case it &apos;s not part of science .
And I used to get in an argument that really gave me a stomachache .
Here &apos;s how it went .
Science is objective , consciousness is subjective , therefore there cannot be a science of consciousness .
Okay , so these twin traditions are paralyzing us .
It &apos;s very hard to get out of these twin traditions .
And I have only one real message in this lecture , and that is , consciousness is a biological phenomenon like photosynthesis , digestion , mitosis — you know all the biological phenomena — and once you accept that , most , though not all , of the hard problems about consciousness simply evaporate .
And I &apos;m going to go through some of them .
Okay , now I promised you to tell you some of the outrageous things said about consciousness .
One : Consciousness does not exist .
It &apos;s an illusion , like sunsets .
Science has shown sunsets and rainbows are illusions .
So consciousness is an illusion .
Two : Well , maybe it exists , but it &apos;s really something else .
It &apos;s a computer program running in the brain .
Three : No , the only thing that exists is really behavior .
It &apos;s embarrassing how influential behaviorism was , but I &apos;ll get back to that .
And four : Maybe consciousness exists , but it can &apos;t make any difference to the world .
Some days it goes up and some days it doesn &apos;t go up . &quot; &quot; No . It goes up whenever I damn well want it to .
Okay . I &apos;m going to tell you how that &apos;s possible .
You can &apos;t do this if you don &apos;t give a definition .
I think it &apos;s rather easy to define if you &apos;re not trying to give a scientific definition .
We &apos;re not ready for a scientific definition , but here &apos;s a common-sense definition .
It begins in the morning when you wake up from a dreamless sleep , and it goes on all day until you fall asleep or die or otherwise become unconscious .
Dreams are a form of consciousness on this definition .
Now , that &apos;s the common-sense definition . That &apos;s our target .
If you &apos;re not talking about that , you &apos;re not talking about consciousness .
I think that has a simple solution too . I &apos;m going to give it to you .
It &apos;s about as mysterious as the liquidity of water .
Right ? The liquidity is not an extra juice squirted out by the H2O molecules .
It &apos;s a condition that the system is in .
The famous mind-body problem is that simple .
All right ? But now we get into some harder questions .
Let &apos;s specify the exact features of consciousness , so that we can then answer those four objections that I made to it .
Well , the first feature is , it &apos;s real and irreducible .
You can &apos;t get rid of it .
You see , the distinction between reality and illusion is the distinction between how things consciously seem to us and how they really are .
It consciously seems like there &apos;s — I like the French &quot; &quot; arc-en-ciel &quot; &quot; — it seems like there &apos;s an arch in the sky , or it seems like the sun is setting over the mountains .
It consciously seems to us , but that &apos;s not really happening .
You cannot doubt the existence of your own consciousness .
Okay , that &apos;s the first feature of consciousness .
You cannot get rid of it by showing that it &apos;s an illusion in a way that you can with other standard illusions .
Okay , the second feature is this one that has been such a source of trouble to us , and that is , all of our conscious states have this qualitative character to them .
Maybe we &apos;ll be able to build a conscious machine .
Since we don &apos;t know how our brains do it , we &apos;re not in a position , so far , to build a conscious machine .
Okay . Another feature of consciousness is that it comes in unified conscious fields .
So I don &apos;t just have the sight of the people in front of me and the sound of my voice and the weight of my shoes against the floor , but they occur to me as part of one single great conscious field that stretches forward and backward .
That is the key to understanding the enormous power of consciousness .
And we have not been able to do that in a robot .
I gave you a scientific demonstration by raising my hand , but how is that possible ?
How can it be that this thought in my brain can move material objects ?
Well , I &apos;ll tell you the answer .
Now , think of what I told you .
One and the same event , my conscious decision to raise my arm has a level of description where it has all of these touchy-feely spiritual qualities .
Now , what that tells us is that our traditional vocabularies for discussing these issues are totally obsolete .
Okay , now with that in mind , with going through these various features of consciousness , let &apos;s go back and answer some of those early objections .
Well , the first one I said was , consciousness doesn &apos;t exist , it &apos;s an illusion . Well , I &apos;ve already answered that .
I don &apos;t think we need to worry about that .
I mean , anybody who &apos;s thought about computers at all can see that that &apos;s wrong , because computation is defined as symbol manipulation , usually thought of as zeros as ones , but any symbols will do .
But we know that that &apos;s purely syntactical . That &apos;s symbolic .
We know that actual human consciousness has something more than that .
It &apos;s got a content in addition to the syntax .
It &apos;s got a semantics .
It creates a reality of money , property , government , marriage , CERN conferences , cocktail parties and summer vacations , and all of those are creations of consciousness .
Their existence is observer-relative .
It &apos;s only relative to conscious agents that a piece of paper is money or that a bunch of buildings is a university .
Now , ask yourself about computation .
Is that absolute , like force and mass and gravitational attraction ?
Or is it observer-relative ?
Well , some computations are intrinsic .
I add two plus two to get four .
That &apos;s going on no matter what anybody thinks .
But when I haul out my pocket calculator and do the calculation , the only intrinsic phenomenon is the electronic circuit and its behavior .
That &apos;s the only absolute phenomenon .
All the rest is interpreted by us .
Computation only exists relative to consciousness .
Either a conscious agent is carrying out the computation , or he &apos;s got a piece of machinery that admits of a computational interpretation .
I spent a lot of money on this hardware .
But we have this persistent confusion between objectivity and subjectivity as features of reality and objectivity and subjectivity as features of claims .
And the bottom line of this part of my talk is this : You can have a completely objective science , a science where you make objectively true claims , about a domain whose existence is subjective , whose existence is in the human brain consisting of subjective states of sentience or feeling or awareness .
So the objection that you can &apos;t have an objective science of consciousness because it &apos;s subjective and science is objective , that &apos;s a pun .
That &apos;s a bad pun on objectivity and subjectivity .
You can make objective claims about a domain that is subjective in its mode of existence , and indeed that &apos;s what neurologists do .
Okay , I promised to refute all these guys , and I don &apos;t have an awful lot of time left , but let me refute a couple more of them .
Your mental states are identical with your behavior ?
Well , think about the distinction between feeling a pain and engaging in pain behavior .
I won &apos;t demonstrate pain behavior , but I can tell you I &apos;m not having any pains right now .
So it &apos;s an obvious mistake . Why did they make the mistake ?
You &apos;re giving up on 300 years of human progress and human hope and all the rest of it .
Thank you very much .

The 2011 Arab Spring captured the attention of the world .
It also captured the attention of authoritarian governments in other countries , who were worried that revolution would spread .
To respond , they ramped up surveillance of activists , journalists and dissidents who they feared would inspire revolution in their own countries .
One prominent Bahraini activist , who was arrested and tortured by his government , has said that the interrogators showed him transcripts of his telephone calls and text messages .
It &apos;s for that reason that many activists specifically avoid using the telephone .
Instead , they use tools like Skype , which they think are immune to interception .
They &apos;re wrong .
Rather than intercepting the communications as they go over the wire , instead they now hack into your computer , enable your webcam , enable your microphone , and steal documents from your computer .
It &apos;s important to note that most governments don &apos;t really have the in-house capabilities to develop this software .
Smaller ones don &apos;t have the resources or the expertise , and so there &apos;s this market of Western companies who are happy to supply them with the tools and techniques for a price .
Gamma is just one of these companies .
I should note also that Gamma never actually sold their software to the Egyptian government .
They &apos;d sent them an invoice for a sale , but the Egyptians never bought it .
Instead , apparently , the Egyptian government used a free demo version of Gamma &apos;s software .
( Laughter ) So this screenshot is from a sales video that Gamma produced .
Really , they &apos;re just emphasizing in a relatively slick presentation the fact that the police can sort of sit in an air-conditioned office and remotely monitor someone without them having any idea that it &apos;s going on .
You know , your webcam light won &apos;t turn on .
There &apos;s nothing to indicate that the microphone is enabled .
This is the managing director of Gamma International .
His name is Martin Muench .
There are many photos of Mr. Muench that exist .
This is perhaps my favorite .
I &apos;m just going to zoom in a little bit onto his webcam .
You can see there &apos;s a little sticker that &apos;s placed over his camera .
He knows what kind of surveillance is possible , and so clearly he doesn &apos;t want it to be used against him .
Muench has said that he intends for his software to be used to capture terrorists and locate pedophiles .
Of course , he &apos;s also acknowledged that once the software has been sold to governments , he has no way of knowing how it can be used .
Gamma &apos;s software has been located on servers in countries around the world , many with really atrocious track records and human rights violations .
They really are selling their software around the world .
Gamma is not the only company in the business .
As I said , it &apos;s a $ 5 billion industry .
One of the other big guys in the industry is an Italian company called Hacking Team .
Now , Hacking Team has what is probably the slickest presentation .
The video they &apos;ve produced is very sexy , and so I &apos;m going to play you a clip just so you can get a feel both for the capabilities of the software but also how it &apos;s marketed to their government clients .
( Video ) Narrator : You want to look through your target &apos;s eyes .
&#91; &quot; &quot; While your target is browsing the web , exchanging documents , receiving SMS , crossing the borders &quot; &quot; &#93; You have to hit many different platforms .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Immune to any protection system Hidden collection infrastructure &quot; &quot; &#93; Deployed all over your country .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Up to hundreds of thousands of targets Managed from a single spot &quot; &quot; &#93; Exactly what we do .
Christopher Soghoian : So , it would be funny if it wasn &apos;t true , but , in fact , Hacking Team &apos;s software is being sold to governments around the world .
Last year we learned , for example , that it &apos;s been used to target Moroccan journalists by the Moroccan government .
Many , many countries it &apos;s been found in .
So , Hacking Team has also been actively courting the U.S. law enforcement market .
In the last year or so , the company has opened a sales office in Maryland .
The company has also hired a spokesperson .
They &apos;ve been attending surveillance industry conferences where law enforcement officials show up .
They &apos;ve spoken at the conferences .
What I thought was most fascinating was they &apos;ve actually paid for the coffee break at one of the law enforcement conferences earlier this year .
I can &apos;t tell you for sure that Hacking Team has sold their technology in the United States , but what I can tell you that if they haven &apos;t sold it , it isn &apos;t because they haven &apos;t been trying hard .
So as I said before , governments that don &apos;t really have the resources to build their own tools will buy off-the-shelf surveillance software , and so for that reason , you see that the government of , say , Tunisia , might use the same software as the government of Germany .
They &apos;re all buying off-the-shelf stuff .
The Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States does have the budget to build their own surveillance technology , and so for several years , I &apos;ve been trying to figure out if and how the FBI is hacking into the computers of surveillance targets .
My friends at an organization called the Electronic Frontier Foundation — they &apos;re a civil society group — obtained hundreds of documents from the FBI detailing their next generation of surveillance technologies .
Most of these documents were heavily redacted , but what you can see from the slides , if I zoom in , is this term : Remote Operations Unit .
Now , when I first looked into this , I &apos;d never heard of this unit before .
I &apos;ve been studying surveillance for more than six years .
I &apos;d never heard of it .
And so I went online and I did some research , and ultimately I hit the mother lode when I went to LinkedIn , the social networking site for job seekers .
There were lots of former U.S. government contractors who had at one point worked for the Remote Operating Unit , and were describing in surprising detail on their CVs what they had done in their former job .
( Laughter ) So I took this information and I gave it to a journalist that I know and trust at the Wall Street Journal , and she was able to contact several other former law enforcement officials who spoke on background and confirmed that yes , in fact , the FBI has a dedicated team that does nothing but hack into the computers of surveillance targets .
Like Gamma and Hacking Team , the FBI also has the capability to remotely activate webcams , microphones , steal documents , get web browsing information , the works .
There &apos;s sort of a big problem with governments going into hacking , and that &apos;s that terrorists , pedophiles , drug dealers , journalists and human rights activists all use the same kinds of computers .
There &apos;s no drug dealer phone and there &apos;s no journalist laptop .
We all use the same technology , and what that means then is that for governments to have the capability to hack into the computers of the real bad guys , they also have to have the capability to hack into our devices too .
In the United States , where I live , there have been no congressional hearings .
There &apos;s no law that &apos;s been passed specifically authorizing this technique , and because of its power and potential for abuse , it &apos;s vital that we have an informed public debate .
Thank you very much .

I was sitting with my girls , and Joy said , &quot; &quot; Dang , I wish he &apos;d get off my back .
My daddy , he calls me all the time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lucky for you he calls at all , &quot; &quot; said Jasmine .
&quot; I haven &apos;t heard from my dad in years . &quot;
At this moment , I knew the girls needed a way to connect with their fathers .
At Camp Diva , my non-profit organization , we have these types of conversations all the time as a way to help girls of African descent prepare for their passage into womanhood .
These girls just needed a way to invite their fathers into their lives on their own terms .
So I asked the girls , &quot; &quot; How can we help other girls develop healthy relationships with their fathers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s have a dance , &quot; &quot; one girl shouted , and all the girls quickly backed her up .
They started dreaming about the decorations , invitations , the dresses they were going to wear , and what their fathers could and could not wear . ( Laughter ) It was off and running before I could even blink my eyes , but even if I could have slowed down those girls , I wouldn &apos;t have , because one thing that I have learned from over a decade of working with girls is that they already know what they need .
The wisdom lives inside of them .
As long as they have infrastructure , mentorship and resources , they can build what they need , not only to survive , but to thrive .
So we had a dance , and girls and their fathers came in multitudes .
They were dressed to the nines .
They acted sweet .
( Laughter ) They acted silly .
They really enjoyed each other &apos;s company .
It was a huge success .
And the girls decided to make it an annual event .
So as the seasons changed , and it was time to plan the dance again , one girl named Brianna spoke up , and she said , &quot; &quot; My dad can &apos;t come to the dance , and this whole thing is making me sad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why not ? &quot; &quot; the girls asked .
&quot; &quot; Because he &apos;s in jail , &quot; &quot; she bravely admitted .
&quot; &quot; Well , can he just get out for a day ? &quot; &quot; one of the girls asked . ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; And come in shackles ?
That &apos;s worse than not having him here at all . &quot; &quot; At this moment , I saw an opportunity for the girls to rise to the occasion and to become their own heroes .
So I asked , &quot; &quot; What do you think we should do about this ?
We want every girl to experience the dance , right ? &quot; &quot; So the girls thought for a moment , and one girl suggested , &quot; Why don &apos;t we just take the dance in the jail ? &quot;
Most of the girls doubted the possibility of that , and said , &quot; &quot; Are you crazy ?
Who is going to allow a bunch of little girls , dressed up — &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; — to come inside a jail and dance with their daddies in Spongebob suits ? &quot;
Because that &apos;s what they called them .
I said , &quot; &quot; Girls , well , well , you never know unless you ask . &quot; &quot; So a letter was written to the Richmond City Sheriff , signed collectively by each girl , and I would have to say , he is a very special sheriff .
He contacted me immediately and said , whenever there is an opportunity to bring families inside , his doors are always open .
Because one thing he did know , that when fathers are connected to their children , it is less likely that they will return .
So , 16 inmates and 18 girls were invited .
The girls were dressed in their Sunday best , and the fathers traded in their yellow and blue jumpsuits for shirts and ties .
They hugged .
They shared a full catered meal of chicken and fish .
They laughed together .
It was beautiful .
The fathers and daughters even experienced an opportunity to have a physical connection , something that a lot of them didn &apos;t even have for a while .
Fathers were in a space where they were able to make their daughters play , and pull out her chair and extend his hand for a dance .
Even the guards cried .
But after the dance , we all realized that Dad still would be in jail .
So we needed to create something that they could take with them .
So we brought in Flip cams , and we had them look at the Flip cams and just interview each other — their messages , their thoughts .
This was going to be used as a touchstone so when they started to miss each other and feel disconnected , they could reconnect through this image .
I &apos;ll never forget that one girl looked in her father &apos;s eyes with that camera and said , &quot; Daddy , when you look at me , what do you see ? &quot;
Because our daddies are our mirrors that we reflect back on when we decide about what type of man we deserve , and how they see us for the rest of our lives .
I know that very well , because I was one of the lucky girls .
I have had my father in my life always .
He &apos;s even here today .
( Applause ) And that is why it is extremely special for me to make sure that these girls are connected to their fathers , especially those who are separated because of barbed wires and metal doors .
We have just created a form for girls who have heavy questions on their heart to be in a position to ask their fathers those questions and given the fathers the freedom to answer .
Because we know that the fathers are even leaving with this one thought : What type of woman am I preparing to put in the world ?
Because a father is locked in does not mean he should be locked out of his daughter &apos;s life .
( Applause )
And these were the results of the Swedish students .
They move up into that corner .
And if we look where the income ends up , this is 100 percent the world &apos;s annual income .
Here in Uganda , development aid .
I can split South Asia here . India &apos;s the big bubble in the middle .
But a huge difference between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka .
This is Mao Tse-tung . He brought health to China .
And to show that , you can put on the way of United Arab Emirates .
They came from here , a mineral country .
If I split Uganda , there &apos;s quite a difference within Uganda .
Everything in this world exists in Africa .
Because the data is hidden down in the databases .
So we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years .
We will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways .
This is the income distribution of the United States , 1970 .
Almost like a ghost , isn &apos;t it ?
I end now with the world .

My title : &quot; &quot; Queerer than we can suppose : the strangeness of science . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Queerer than we can suppose &quot; &quot; comes from J.B.S. Haldane , the famous biologist , who said , &quot; &quot; Now , my own suspicion is that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose , but queerer than we can suppose .
I suspect that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of , or can be dreamed of , in any philosophy . &quot; &quot; Richard Feynman compared the accuracy of quantum theories — experimental predictions — to specifying the width of North America to within one hair &apos;s breadth of accuracy .
This means that quantum theory has got to be , in some sense , true .
Yet the assumptions that quantum theory needs to make in order to deliver those predictions are so mysterious that even Feynman himself was moved to remark , &quot; &quot; If you think you understand quantum theory , you don &apos;t understand quantum theory . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so queer that physicists resort to one or another paradoxical interpretation of it .
David Deutsch , who &apos;s talking here , in &quot; &quot; The Fabric of Reality , &quot; &quot; embraces the many-worlds interpretation of quantum theory , because the worst that you can say about it is that it &apos;s preposterously wasteful .
It postulates a vast and rapidly growing number of universes existing in parallel , mutually undetectable , except through the narrow porthole of quantum mechanical experiments .
And that &apos;s Richard Feynman .
The biologist Lewis Wolpert believes that the queerness of modern physics is just an extreme example .
Science , as opposed to technology , does violence to common sense .
Every time you drink a glass of water , he points out , the odds are that you will imbibe at least one molecule that passed through the bladder of Oliver Cromwell .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s just elementary probability theory . ( Laughter )
The number of molecules per glassful is hugely greater than the number of glassfuls , or bladdersful , in the world .
And of course , there &apos;s nothing special about Cromwell or bladders — you have just breathed in a nitrogen atom that passed through the right lung of the third iguanodon to the left of the tall cycad tree .
&quot; Queerer than we can suppose . &quot;
What is it that makes us capable of supposing anything , and does this tell us anything about what we can suppose ?
Are there things about the universe that will be forever beyond our grasp , but not beyond the grasp of some superior intelligence ? Are there things about the universe
that are , in principle , ungraspable by any mind , however superior ?
The history of science has been one long series of violent brainstorms , as successive generations have come to terms with increasing levels of queerness in the universe .
We &apos;re now so used to the idea that the Earth spins , rather than the Sun moves across the sky , it &apos;s hard for us to realize what a shattering mental revolution that must have been .
After all , it seems obvious that the Earth is large and motionless , the Sun , small and mobile .
But it &apos;s worth recalling Wittgenstein &apos;s remark on the subject : &quot; &quot; Tell me , &quot; &quot; he asked a friend , &quot; &quot; why do people always say it was natural for man to assume that the Sun went &apos; round the Earth , rather than that the Earth was rotating ? &quot; &quot; And his friend replied , &quot; &quot; Well , obviously , because it just looks as though the Sun is going round the Earth . &quot; &quot; Wittgenstein replied , &quot; &quot; Well , what would it have looked like if it had looked as though the Earth was rotating ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Science has taught us , against all intuition , that apparently solid things , like crystals and rocks , are really almost entirely composed of empty space .
And the familiar illustration is the nucleus of an atom is a fly in the middle of a sports stadium , and the next atom is in the next sports stadium .
So it would seem the hardest , solidest , densest rock is really almost entirely empty space , broken only by tiny particles so widely spaced they shouldn &apos;t count .
Why , then , do rocks look and feel solid and hard and impenetrable ?
As an evolutionary biologist , I &apos;d say this : our brains have evolved to help us survive within the orders of magnitude , of size and speed which our bodies operate at .
We never evolved to navigate in the world of atoms .
If we had , our brains probably would perceive rocks as full of empty space .
Rocks feel hard and impenetrable to our hands , precisely because objects like rocks and hands cannot penetrate each other .
It &apos;s therefore useful for our brains to construct notions like &quot; &quot; solidity &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; impenetrability , &quot; &quot; because such notions help us to navigate our bodies through the middle-sized world in which we have to navigate .
Moving to the other end of the scale , our ancestors never had to navigate through the cosmos at speeds close to the speed of light .
If they had , our brains would be much better at understanding Einstein .
I want to give the name &quot; &quot; Middle World &quot; &quot; to the medium-scaled environment in which we &apos;ve evolved the ability to take act — nothing to do with &quot; &quot; Middle Earth &quot; &quot; — Middle World .
( Laughter ) We are evolved denizens of Middle World , and that limits what we are capable of imagining .
We find it intuitively easy to grasp ideas like , when a rabbit moves at the sort of medium velocity at which rabbits and other Middle World objects move , and hits another Middle World object like a rock , it knocks itself out .
May I introduce Major General Albert Stubblebine III , commander of military intelligence in 1983 .
&quot; &quot; ... &#91; He &#93; stared at his wall in Arlington , Virginia , and decided to do it .
As frightening as the prospect was , he was going into the next office .
He stood up and moved out from behind his desk .
&apos;What is the atom mostly made of ? &apos; he thought , &apos; Space . &apos; He started walking . &apos; What am I mostly made of ? Atoms . &apos; He quickened his pace , almost to a jog now .
&apos;What is the wall mostly made of ? &apos; ( Laughter ) &apos; Atoms ! &apos; All I have to do is merge the spaces .
Then , General Stubblebine banged his nose hard on the wall of his office .
Stubblebine , who commanded 16,000 soldiers , was confounded by his continual failure to walk through the wall .
He has no doubt that this ability will one day be a common tool in the military arsenal .
Who would screw around with an army that could do that ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s from an article in Playboy , which I was reading the other day .
( Laughter ) I have every reason to think it &apos;s true ; I was reading Playboy because I , myself , had an article in it . ( Laughter )
Unaided human intuition , schooled in Middle World , finds it hard to believe Galileo when he tells us a heavy object and a light object , air friction aside , would hit the ground at the same instant .
And that &apos;s because in Middle World , air friction is always there .
If we &apos;d evolved in a vacuum , we would expect them to hit the ground simultaneously .
If we were bacteria , constantly buffeted by thermal movements of molecules , it would be different .
But we Middle-Worlders are too big to notice Brownian motion .
In the same way , our lives are dominated by gravity , but are almost oblivious to the force of surface tension .
A small insect would reverse these priorities .
Steve Grand — he &apos;s the one on the left , Douglas Adams is on the right .
Steve Grand , in his book , &quot; &quot; Creation : Life and How to Make It , &quot; &quot; is positively scathing about our preoccupation with matter itself .
We have this tendency to think that only solid , material things are really things at all .
Waves of electromagnetic fluctuation in a vacuum seem unreal .
Victorians thought the waves had to be waves in some material medium : the ether .
But we find real matter comforting only because we &apos;ve evolved to survive in Middle World , where matter is a useful fiction .
A whirlpool , for Steve Grand , is a thing with just as much reality as a rock .
In a desert plain in Tanzania , in the shadow of the volcano Ol Doinyo Lengai , there &apos;s a dune made of volcanic ash .
The beautiful thing is that it moves bodily .
It &apos;s what &apos;s technically known as a &quot; &quot; barchan , &quot; &quot; and the entire dune walks across the desert in a westerly direction at a speed of about 17 meters per year .
It retains its crescent shape and moves in the direction of the horns .
What happens is that the wind blows the sand up the shallow slope on the other side , and then , as each sand grain hits the top of the ridge , it cascades down on the inside of the crescent , and so the whole horn-shaped dune moves .
Steve Grand points out that you and I are , ourselves , more like a wave than a permanent thing .
He invites us , the reader , to think of an experience from your childhood , something you remember clearly , something you can see , feel , maybe even smell , as if you were really there .
After all , you really were there at the time , weren &apos;t you ?
How else would you remember it ?
But here is the bombshell : You weren &apos;t there .
Not a single atom that is in your body today was there when that event took place .
Matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you .
Whatever you are , therefore , you are not the stuff of which you are made .
If that doesn &apos;t make the hair stand up on the back of your neck , read it again until it does , because it is important .
So &quot; &quot; really &quot; &quot; isn &apos;t a word that we should use with simple confidence .
If a neutrino had a brain , which it evolved in neutrino-sized ancestors , it would say that rocks really do consist of empty space .
We have brains that evolved in medium-sized ancestors which couldn &apos;t walk through rocks .
&quot; &quot; Really , &quot; &quot; for an animal , is whatever its brain needs it to be in order to assist its survival .
And because different species live in different worlds , there will be a discomforting variety of &quot; &quot; reallys . &quot; &quot; What we see of the real world is not the unvarnished world , but a model of the world , regulated and adjusted by sense data , but constructed so it &apos;s useful for dealing with the real world .
The nature of the model depends on the kind of animal we are .
A flying animal needs a different kind of model from a walking , climbing or swimming animal .
A monkey &apos;s brain must have software capable of simulating a three-dimensional world of branches and trunks .
A mole &apos;s software for constructing models of its world will be customized for underground use .
A water strider &apos;s brain doesn &apos;t need 3D software at all , since it lives on the surface of the pond , in an Edwin Abbott flatland .
I &apos;ve speculated that bats may see color with their ears .
The world model that a bat needs in order to navigate through three dimensions catching insects must be pretty similar to the world model that any flying bird — a day-flying bird like a swallow — needs to perform the same kind of tasks .
The fact that the bat uses echoes in pitch darkness to input the current variables to its model , while the swallow uses light , is incidental .
Bats , I &apos;ve even suggested , use perceived hues , such as red and blue , as labels , internal labels , for some useful aspect of echoes — perhaps the acoustic texture of surfaces , furry or smooth and so on — in the same way as swallows or indeed , we , use those perceived hues — redness and blueness , etc . — to label long and short wavelengths of light .
There &apos;s nothing inherent about red that makes it long wavelength .
The point is that the nature of the model is governed by how it is to be used , rather than by the sensory modality involved .
J.B.S. Haldane himself had something to say about animals whose world is dominated by smell .
Dogs can distinguish two very similar fatty acids , extremely diluted : caprylic acid and caproic acid .
The only difference , you see , is that one has an extra pair of carbon atoms in the chain .
Haldane guesses that a dog would probably be able to place the acids in the order of their molecular weights by their smells , just as a man could place a number of piano wires in the order of their lengths by means of their notes .
Now , there &apos;s another fatty acid , capric acid , which is just like the other two , except that it has two more carbon atoms .
A dog that had never met capric acid would , perhaps , have no more trouble imagining its smell than we would have trouble imagining a trumpet , say , playing one note higher than we &apos;ve heard a trumpet play before .
Perhaps dogs and rhinos and other smell-oriented animals smell in color .
And the argument would be exactly the same as for the bats .
Middle World — the range of sizes and speeds which we have evolved to feel intuitively comfortable with — is a bit like the narrow range of the electromagnetic spectrum that we see as light of various colors .
We &apos;re blind to all frequencies outside that , unless we use instruments to help us .
Middle World is the narrow range of reality which we judge to be normal , as opposed to the queerness of the very small , the very large and the very fast .
We could make a similar scale of improbabilities ; nothing is totally impossible .
Miracles are just events that are extremely improbable .
A marble statue could wave its hand at us ; the atoms that make up its crystalline structure are all vibrating back and forth anyway .
Because there are so many of them , and because there &apos;s no agreement among them in their preferred direction of movement , the marble , as we see it in Middle World , stays rock steady .
But the atoms in the hand could all just happen to move the same way at the same time , and again and again .
In this case , the hand would move , and we &apos;d see it waving at us in Middle World .
The odds against it , of course , are so great that if you set out writing zeros at the time of the origin of the universe , you still would not have written enough zeros to this day .
Evolution in Middle World has not equipped us to handle very improbable events ; we don &apos;t live long enough .
In the vastness of astronomical space and geological time , that which seems impossible in Middle World might turn out to be inevitable .
One way to think about that is by counting planets .
We don &apos;t know how many planets there are in the universe , but a good estimate is about 10 to the 20 , or 100 billion billion .
And that gives us a nice way to express our estimate of life &apos;s improbability .
We could make some sort of landmark points along a spectrum of improbability , which might look like the electromagnetic spectrum we just looked at .
If life has arisen only once on any — life could originate once per planet , could be extremely common or it could originate once per star or once per galaxy or maybe only once in the entire universe , in which case it would have to be here .
And somewhere up there would be the chance that a frog would turn into a prince , and similar magical things like that .
If life has arisen on only one planet in the entire universe , that planet has to be our planet , because here we are talking about it .
And that means that if we want to avail ourselves of it , we &apos;re allowed to postulate chemical events in the origin of life which have a probability as low as one in 100 billion billion .
I don &apos;t think we shall have to avail ourselves of that , because I suspect that life is quite common in the universe .
And when I say quite common , it could still be so rare that no one island of life ever encounters another , which is a sad thought .
How shall we interpret &quot; &quot; queerer than we can suppose ? &quot; &quot; Queerer than can in principle be supposed , or just queerer than we can suppose , given the limitations of our brain &apos;s evolutionary apprenticeship in Middle World ?
Could we , by training and practice , emancipate ourselves from Middle World and achieve some sort of intuitive as well as mathematical understanding of the very small and the very large ?
I genuinely don &apos;t know the answer .
I wonder whether we might help ourselves to understand , say , quantum theory , if we brought up children to play computer games beginning in early childhood , which had a make-believe world of balls going through two slits on a screen , a world in which the strange goings-on of quantum mechanics were enlarged by the computer &apos;s make-believe , so that they became familiar on the Middle-World scale of the stream .
And similarly , a relativistic computer game , in which objects on the screen manifest the Lorentz contraction , and so on , to try to get ourselves — to get children into the way of thinking about it .
I want to end by applying the idea of Middle World to our perceptions of each other .
Most scientists today subscribe to a mechanistic view of the mind : we &apos;re the way we are because our brains are wired up as they are , our hormones are the way they are .
We &apos;d be different , our characters would be different , if our neuro-anatomy and our physiological chemistry were different .
But we scientists are inconsistent .
If we were consistent , our response to a misbehaving person , like a child-murderer , should be something like : this unit has a faulty component ; it needs repairing .
That &apos;s not what we say .
What we say — and I include the most austerely mechanistic among us , which is probably me — what we say is , &quot; &quot; Vile monster , prison is too good for you . &quot; &quot; Or worse , we seek revenge , in all probability thereby triggering the next phase in an escalating cycle of counter-revenge , which we see , of course , all over the world today .
In short , when we &apos;re thinking like academics , we regard people as elaborate and complicated machines , like computers or cars .
But when we revert to being human , we behave more like Basil Fawlty , who , we remember , thrashed his car to teach it a lesson , when it wouldn &apos;t start on &quot; &quot; Gourmet Night . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The reason we personify things like cars and computers is that just as monkeys live in an arboreal world and moles live in an underground world and water striders live in a surface tension-dominated flatland , we live in a social world .
We swim through a sea of people — a social version of Middle World .
We are evolved to second-guess the behavior of others by becoming brilliant , intuitive psychologists .
Treating people as machines may be scientifically and philosophically accurate , but it &apos;s a cumbersome waste of time if you want to guess what this person is going to do next .
The economically useful way to model a person is to treat him as a purposeful , goal-seeking agent with pleasures and pains , desires and intentions , guilt , blame-worthiness .
Personification and the imputing of intentional purpose is such a brilliantly successful way to model humans , it &apos;s hardly surprising the same modeling software often seizes control when we &apos;re trying to think about entities for which it &apos;s not appropriate , like Basil Fawlty with his car or like millions of deluded people , with the universe as a whole .
( Laughter ) If the universe is queerer than we can suppose , is it just because we &apos;ve been naturally selected to suppose only what we needed to suppose in order to survive in the Pleistocene of Africa ?
Or are our brains so versatile and expandable that we can train ourselves to break out of the box of our evolution ?
Or finally , are there some things in the universe so queer that no philosophy of beings , however godlike , could dream them ?
Thank you very much .

The maxim , &quot; &quot; Know thyself &quot; &quot; has been around since the ancient Greeks .
By the way , feel free to check in on my head at any time .
Trees epitomize stasis .
Trees are rooted in the ground in one place for many human generations , but if we shift our perspective from the trunk to the twigs , trees become very dynamic entities , moving and growing .
And I decided to explore this movement by turning trees into artists .
I simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig .
I waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas , and that produced art .
The piece of art you see on your left is painted by a western red cedar and that on your right by a Douglas fir , and what I learned was that different species have different signatures , like a Picasso versus a Monet .
But I was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it , so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree — which produced this painting — moved in a single year , I simply measured and summed each of those lines .
I multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch and the number of branches per tree and then divided that by the number of minutes per year .
And so I was able to calculate how far a single tree moved in a single year .
You might have a guess .
The answer is actually 186,540 miles , or seven times around the globe .
And so simply by shifting our perspective from a single trunk to the many dynamic twigs , we are able to see that trees are not simply static entities , but rather extremely dynamic .
And I began to think about ways that we might consider this lesson of trees , to consider other entities that are also static and stuck , but which cry for change and dynamicism , and one of those entities is our prisons .
Prisons , of course , are where people who break our laws are stuck , confined behind bars .
And our prison system itself is stuck .
The United States has over 2.3 million incarcerated men and women .
That number is rising .
Of the 100 incarcerated people that are released , 60 will return to prison .
Funds for education , for training and for rehabilitation are declining , so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues .
I decided to ask whether the lesson I had learned from trees as artists could be applied to a static institution such as our prisons , and I think the answer is yes .
In the year 2007 , I started a partnership with the Washington State Department of Corrections .
Working with four prisons , we began bringing science and scientists , sustainability and conservation projects to four state prisons .
We give science lectures , and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures instead of watching television or weightlifting .
That , I think , is movement .
We partnered with the Nature Conservancy for inmates at Stafford Creek Correctional Center to grow endangered prairie plants for restoration of relic prairie areas in Washington state .
That , I think , is movement .
We worked with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife to grow endangered frogs — the Oregon spotted frog — for later release into protected wetlands .
That , I think , is movement .
And just recently , we &apos;ve begun to work with those men who are segregated in what we call Supermax facilities .
They &apos;ve incurred violent infractions by becoming violent with guards and with other prisoners .
They &apos;re kept in bare cells like this for 23 hours a day .
When they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals , they &apos;re placed in immobile booths like this .
For one hour a day they &apos;re brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards .
Although we can &apos;t bring trees and prairie plants and frogs into these environments , we are bringing images of nature into these exercise yards , putting them on the walls , so at least they get contact with visual images of nature .
This is Mr. Lopez , who has been in solitary confinement for 18 months , and he &apos;s providing input on the types of images that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates more serene , more calm , less apt to violence .
And so what we see , I think , is that small , collective movements of change can perhaps move an entity such as our own prison system in a direction of hope .
We know that trees are static entities when we look at their trunks .
But if trees can create art , if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year , if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs , then perhaps there are other static entities that we hold inside ourselves , like grief , like addictions , like racism , that can also change .
Thank you very much .

I &apos;m Jessi , and this is my suitcase .
But before I show you what I &apos;ve got inside , I &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that is , I &apos;m outfit-obsessed .
I love finding , wearing , and more recently , photographing and blogging a different , colorful , crazy outfit for every single occasion .
But I don &apos;t buy anything new .
I get all my clothes secondhand from flea markets and thrift stores .
Aww , thank you .
Secondhand shopping allows me to reduce the impact my wardrobe has on the environment and on my wallet .
I get to meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars usually go to a good cause ; I look pretty unique ; and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt .
I mean , what am I going to find today ?
Is it going to be my size ?
Will I like the color ?
Will it be under $ 20 ?
If all the answers are yes , I feel as though I &apos;ve won .
I want to get back to my suitcase and tell you what I packed for this exciting week here at TED .
I mean , what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her ?
So I &apos;m going to show you exactly what I brought .
I brought seven pairs of underpants and that &apos;s it .
Exactly one week &apos;s worth of undies is all I put in my suitcase .
I was betting that I &apos;d be able to find everything else I could possible want to wear once I got here to Palm Springs .
And since you don &apos;t know me as the woman walking around TED in her underwear — ( Laughter ) that means I found a few things .
And I &apos;d really love to show you my week &apos;s worth of outfits right now .
Does that sound good ?
( Applause ) So as I do this , I &apos;m also going to tell you a few of the life lessons that , believe it or not , I have picked up in these adventures wearing nothing new .
So let &apos;s start with Sunday .
I call this &quot; &quot; Shiny Tiger . &quot; &quot; You do not have to spend a lot of money to look great .
You can almost always look phenomenal for under $ 50 .
This whole outfit , including the jacket , cost me $ 55 , and it was the most expensive thing that I wore the entire week .
Monday : Color is powerful .
It is almost physiologically impossible to be in a bad mood when you &apos;re wearing bright red pants .
( Laughter ) If you are happy , you are going to attract other happy people to you .
Tuesday : Fitting in is way overrated .
I &apos;ve spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in .
Just be who you are .
If you are surrounding yourself with the right people , they will not only get it , they will appreciate it .
Wednesday : Embrace your inner child .
Sometimes people tell me that I look like I &apos;m playing dress-up , or that I remind them of their seven-year-old .
I like to smile and say , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; Thursday : Confidence is key .
If you think you look good in something , you almost certainly do .
And if you don &apos;t think you look good in something , you &apos;re also probably right .
I grew up with a mom who taught me this day-in and day-out .
But it wasn &apos;t until I turned 30 that I really got what this meant .
And I &apos;m going to break it down for you for just a second .
If you believe you &apos;re a beautiful person inside and out , there is no look that you can &apos;t pull off .
So there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience .
We should be able to rock anything we want to rock .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Friday : A universal truth — five words for you : Gold sequins go with everything .
And finally , Saturday : Developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word .
It &apos;s been proven to me time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what I &apos;m wearing , and we &apos;ve had great conversations .
So obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny suitcase .
So before I go home to Brooklyn , I &apos;m going to donate everything back .
Because the lesson I &apos;m trying to learn myself this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
I don &apos;t need to get emotionally attached to these things because around the corner , there is always going to be another crazy , colorful , shiny outfit just waiting for me , if I put a little love in my heart and look .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m a garbage man .
And you might find it interesting that I became a garbage man , because I absolutely hate waste .
I hope , within the next 10 minutes , to change the way you think about a lot of the stuff in your life .
And I &apos;d like to start at the very beginning .
Think back when you were just a kid .
How did look at the stuff in your life ?
Perhaps it was like these toddler rules : It &apos;s my stuff if I saw it first .
The entire pile is my stuff if I &apos;m building something .
The more stuff that &apos;s mine , the better .
And of course , it &apos;s your stuff if it &apos;s broken .
( Laughter ) Well after spending about 20 years in the recycling industry , it &apos;s become pretty clear to me that we don &apos;t necessarily leave these toddler rules behind as we develop into adults .
And let me tell you why I have that perspective .
Because each and every day at our recycling plants around the world we handle about one million pounds of people &apos;s discarded stuff .
Now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff , but it &apos;s a tiny drop of the durable goods that are disposed each and every year around the world — well less than one percent .
In fact , the United Nations estimates that there &apos;s about 85 billion pounds a year of electronics waste that gets discarded around the world each and every year — and that &apos;s one of the most rapidly growing parts of our waste stream .
And if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth , that number well more than doubles .
And of course , the more developed the country , the bigger these mountains .
Now when you see these mountains , most people think of garbage .
We see above-ground mines .
And the reason we see mines is because there &apos;s a lot of valuable raw materials that went into making all of this stuff in the first place .
And it &apos;s becoming increasingly important that we figure out how to extract these raw materials from these extremely complicated waste streams .
Because as we &apos;ve heard all week at TED , the world &apos;s getting to be a smaller place with more people in it who want more and more stuff .
And of course , they want the toys and the tools that many of us take for granted .
And what goes into making those toys and tools that we use every single day ?
It &apos;s mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals .
And the metals , we typically get from ore that we mine in ever widening mines and ever deepening mines around the world .
And the plastics , we get from oil , which we go to more remote locations and drill ever deeper wells to extract .
And these practices have significant economic and environmental implications that we &apos;re already starting to see today .
The good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end-of-life stuff and starting to recycle our end-of-life stuff , particularly in regions of the world like here in Europe that have recycling policies in place that require that this stuff be recycled in a responsible manner .
Most of what &apos;s extracted from our end-of-life stuff , if it makes it to a recycler , are the metals .
To put that in perspective — and I &apos;m using steel as a proxy here for metals , because it &apos;s the most common metal — if your stuff makes it to a recycler , probably over 90 percent of the metals are going to be recovered and reused for another purpose .
Plastics are a whole other story : well less than 10 percent are recovered .
In fact , it &apos;s more like five percent .
Most of it &apos;s incinerated or landfilled .
Now most people think that &apos;s because plastics are a throw-away material , have very little value .
But actually , plastics are several times more valuable than steel .
And there &apos;s more plastics produced and consumed around the world on a volume basis every year than steel .
So why is such a plentiful and valuable material not recovered at anywhere near the rate of the less valuable material ?
Well it &apos;s predominantly because metals are very easy to recycle from other materials and from one another .
They have very different densities .
They have different electrical and magnetic properties .
And they even have different colors .
So it &apos;s very easy for either humans or machines to separate these metals from one another and from other materials .
Plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range .
They have either identical or very similar electrical and magnetic properties .
And any plastic can be any color , as you probably well know .
So the traditional ways of separating materials just simply don &apos;t work for plastics .
Another consequence of metals being so easy to recycle by humans is that a lot of our stuff from the developed world — and sadly to say , particularly from the United States , where we don &apos;t have any recycling policies in place like here in Europe — finds its way to developing countries for low-cost recycling .
People , for as little as a dollar a day , pick through our stuff .
They extract what they can , which is mostly the metals — circuit boards and so forth — and they leave behind mostly what they can &apos;t recover , which is , again , mostly the plastics .
Or they burn the plastics to get to the metals in burn houses like you see here .
And they extract the metals by hand .
Now while this may be the low-economic-cost solution , this is certainly not the low-environmental or human health-and-safety solution .
I call this environmental arbitrage .
And it &apos;s not fair , it &apos;s not safe and it &apos;s not sustainable .
Now because the plastics are so plentiful — and by the way , those other methods don &apos;t lead to the recovery of plastics , obviously — but people do try to recover the plastics .
This is just one example .
This is a photo I took standing on the rooftops of one of the largest slums in the world in Mumbai , India .
They store the plastics on the roofs .
They bring them below those roofs into small workshops like these , and people try very hard to separate the plastics , by color , by shape , by feel , by any technique they can .
And sometimes they &apos;ll resort to what &apos;s known as the &quot; &quot; burn and sniff &quot; &quot; technique where they &apos;ll burn the plastic and smell the fumes to try to determine the type of plastic .
None of these techniques result in any amount of recycling in any significant way .
And by the way , please don &apos;t try this technique at home .
So what are we to do about this space-age material , at least what we used to call a space-aged material , these plastics ?
Well I certainly believe that it &apos;s far too valuable and far too abundant to keep putting back in the ground or certainly send up in smoke .
So about 20 years ago , I literally started in my garage tinkering around , trying to figure out how to separate these very similar materials from each other , and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends , in the mining world actually , and in the plastics world , and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world .
Because after all , we &apos;re doing above-ground mining .
And we eventually broke the code .
This is the last frontier of recycling .
It &apos;s the last major material to be recovered in any significant amount on the Earth .
And we finally figured out how to do it .
And in the process , we started recreating how the plastics industry makes plastics .
The traditional way to make plastics is with oil or petrochemicals .
You breakdown the molecules , you recombine them in very specific ways , to make all the wonderful plastics that we enjoy each and every day .
We said , there &apos;s got to be a more sustainable way to make plastics .
And not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint , sustainable from an economic standpoint as well .
Well a good place to start is with waste .
It certainly doesn &apos;t cost as much as oil , and it &apos;s plentiful , as I hope that you &apos;ve been able to see from the photographs .
And because we &apos;re not breaking down the plastic into molecules and recombining them , we &apos;re using a mining approach to extract the materials .
We have significantly lower capital costs in our plant equipment .
We have enormous energy savings .
I don &apos;t know how many other projects on the planet right now can save 80 to 90 percent of the energy compared to making something the traditional way .
And instead of plopping down several hundred million dollars to build a chemical plant that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life , our plants can make any type of plastic we feed them .
And we make a drop-in replacement for that plastic that &apos;s made from petrochemicals .
Our customers get to enjoy huge CO2 savings .
They get to close the loop with their products .
And they get to make more sustainable products .
In the short time period I have , I want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this .
It starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits .
They recover the metals and leave behind what &apos;s called shredder residue — it &apos;s their waste — a very complex mixture of materials , but predominantly plastics .
We take out the things that aren &apos;t plastics , such as the metals they missed , carpeting , foam , rubber , wood , glass , paper , you name it .
Even an occasional dead animal , unfortunately .
And it goes in the first part of our process here , which is more like traditional recycling .
We &apos;re sieving the material , we &apos;re using magnets , we &apos;re using air classification .
It looks like the Willy Wonka factory at this point .
At the end of this process , we have a mixed plastic composite : many different types of plastics and many different grades of plastics .
This goes into the more sophisticated part of our process , and the really hard work , multi-step separation process begins .
We grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail .
We use a very highly automated process to sort those plastics , not only by type , but by grade .
And out the end of that part of the process come little flakes of plastic : one type , one grade .
We then use optical sorting to color sort this material .
We blend it in 50,000-lb. blending silos .
We push that material to extruders where we melt it , push it through small die holes , make spaghetti-like plastic strands .
And we chop those strands into what are called pellets .
And this becomes the currency of the plastics industry .
This is the same material that you would get from oil .
And today , we &apos;re producing it from your old stuff , and it &apos;s going right back into your new stuff .
( Applause ) So now , instead of your stuff ending up on a hillside in a developing country or literally going up in smoke , you can find your old stuff back on top of your desk in new products , in your office , or back at work in your home .
And these are just a few examples of companies that are buying our plastic , replacing virgin plastic , to make their new products .
So I hope I &apos;ve changed the way you look at at least some of the stuff in your life .
We took our clues from mother nature .
Mother nature wastes very little , reuses practically everything .
And I hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer — that &apos;s a label I &apos;ve always hated my entire life — and think of yourself as just using resources in one form , until they can be transformed to another form for another use later in time .
And finally , I hope you agree with me to change that last toddler rule just a little bit to : &quot; &quot; If it &apos;s broken , it &apos;s my stuff . &quot; &quot; Thank you for your time .
( Applause )
I &apos;d like to take you to another world .
And I &apos;d like to share a 45 year-old love story with the poor , living on less than one dollar a day .
I went to a very elitist , snobbish , expensive education in India , and that almost destroyed me .
I was all set to be a diplomat , teacher , doctor — all laid out .
Then , I don &apos;t look it , but I was the Indian national squash champion for three years .
( Laughter ) The whole world was laid out for me .
Everything was at my feet .
I could do nothing wrong .
And then I thought out of curiosity I &apos;d like to go and live and work and just see what a village is like .
So in 1965 , I went to what was called the worst Bihar famine in India , and I saw starvation , death , people dying of hunger , for the first time .
It changed my life .
I came back home , told my mother , &quot; I &apos;d like to live and work in a village . &quot;
Mother went into a coma .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; What is this ?
The whole world is laid out for you , the best jobs are laid out for you , and you want to go and work in a village ?
I mean , is there something wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;ve got the best eduction .
It made me think .
And I wanted to give something back in my own way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want to do in a village ?
No job , no money , no security , no prospect . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I want to live and dig wells for five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dig wells for five years ?
You went to the most expensive school and college in India , and you want to dig wells for five years ? &quot; &quot; She didn &apos;t speak to me for a very long time , because she thought I &apos;d let my family down .
But then , I was exposed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills that very poor people have , which are never brought into the mainstream — which is never identified , respected , applied on a large scale .
And I thought I &apos;d start a Barefoot College — college only for the poor .
What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college .
I went to this village for the first time .
Elders came to me and said , &quot; &quot; Are you running from the police ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You failed in your exam ? &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot;
&quot; You didn &apos;t get a government job ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
&quot; &quot; What are you doing here ?
Why are you here ?
The education system in India makes you look at Paris and New Delhi and Zurich ; what are you doing in this village ?
Is there something wrong with you you &apos;re not telling us ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I want to actually start a college only for the poor .
What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college . &quot; &quot; So the elders gave me some very sound and profound advice .
They said , &quot; &quot; Please , don &apos;t bring anyone with a degree and qualification into your college . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s the only college in India where , if you should have a Ph.D. or a Master &apos;s , you are disqualified to come .
You have to be a cop-out or a wash-out or a dropout to come to our college .
You have to work with your hands .
You have to have a dignity of labor .
You have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community and provide a service to the community .
So we started the Barefoot College , and we redefined professionalism .
Who is a professional ?
A professional is someone who has a combination of competence , confidence and belief .
A water diviner is a professional .
A traditional midwife is a professional .
A traditional bone setter is a professional .
These are professionals all over the world .
You find them in any inaccessible village around the world .
And we thought that these people should come into the mainstream and show that the knowledge and skills that they have is universal .
It needs to be used , needs to be applied , needs to be shown to the world outside — that these knowledge and skills are relevant even today .
So the college works following the lifestyle and workstyle of Mahatma Gandhi .
You eat on the floor , you sleep on the floor , you work on the floor .
There are no contracts , no written contracts .
You can stay with me for 20 years , go tomorrow .
And no one can get more than $ 100 a month .
You come for the money , you don &apos;t come to Barefoot College .
You come for the work and the challenge , you &apos;ll come to the Barefoot College .
That is where we want you to try crazy ideas .
Whatever idea you have , come and try it .
It doesn &apos;t matter if you fail .
Battered , bruised , you start again .
It &apos;s the only college where the teacher is the learner and the learner is the teacher .
And it &apos;s the only college where we don &apos;t give a certificate .
You are certified by the community you serve .
You don &apos;t need a paper to hang on the wall to show that you are an engineer .
So when I said that , they said , &quot; &quot; Well show us what is possible . What are you doing ?
This is all mumbo-jumbo if you can &apos;t show it on the ground . &quot; &quot; So we built the first Barefoot College in 1986 .
It was built by 12 Barefoot architects who can &apos;t read and write , built on $ 1.50 a sq. ft .
150 people lived there , worked there .
They got the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2002 .
But then they suspected , they thought there was an architect behind it .
I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , they made the blueprints , but the Barefoot architects actually constructed the college . &quot; &quot; We are the only ones who actually returned the award for $ 50,000 , because they didn &apos;t believe us , and we thought that they were actually casting aspersions on the Barefoot architects of Tilonia .
I asked a forester — high-powered , paper-qualified expert — I said , &quot; &quot; What can you build in this place ? &quot; &quot; He had one look at the soil and said , &quot; &quot; Forget it . No way .
Not even worth it .
No water , rocky soil . &quot; &quot; I was in a bit of a spot .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;ll go to the old man in village and say , &apos; What should I grow in this spot ? &apos; &quot; &quot; He looked quietly at me and said , &quot; You build this , you build this , you put this , and it &apos;ll work . &quot;
This is what it looks like today .
Went to the roof , and all the women said , &quot; &quot; Clear out .
The men should clear out because we don &apos;t want to share this technology with the men .
This is waterproofing the roof . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It is a bit of jaggery , a bit of urens and a bit of other things I don &apos;t know .
But it actually doesn &apos;t leak .
Since 1986 , it hasn &apos;t leaked .
This technology , the women will not share with the men .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s the only college which is fully solar-electrified .
All the power comes from the sun .
45 kilowatts of panels on the roof .
And everything works off the sun for the next 25 years .
So long as the sun shines , we &apos;ll have no problem with power .
But the beauty is that is was installed by a priest , a Hindu priest , who &apos;s only done eight years of primary schooling — never been to school , never been to college .
He knows more about solar than anyone I know anywhere in the world guaranteed .
Food , if you come to the Barefoot College , is solar cooked .
But the people who fabricated that solar cooker are women , illiterate women , who actually fabricate the most sophisticated solar cooker .
It &apos;s a parabolic Scheffler solar cooker .
Unfortunately , they &apos;re almost half German , they &apos;re so precise .
( Laughter ) You &apos;ll never find Indian women so precise .
Absolutely to the last inch , they can make that cooker .
And we have 60 meals twice a day of solar cooking .
We have a dentist — she &apos;s a grandmother , illiterate , who &apos;s a dentist .
She actually looks after the teeth of 7,000 children .
Barefoot technology : this was 1986 — no engineer , no architect thought of it — but we are collecting rainwater from the roofs .
Very little water is wasted .
All the roofs are connected underground to a 400,000 liter tank , and no water is wasted .
If we have four years of drought , we still have water on the campus , because we collect rainwater .
60 percent of children don &apos;t go to school , because they have to look after animals — sheep , goats — domestic chores .
So we thought of starting a school at night for the children .
Because the night schools of Tilonia , over 75,000 children have gone through these night schools .
Because it &apos;s for the convenience of the child ; it &apos;s not for the convenience of the teacher .
And what do we teach in these schools ?
Democracy , citizenship , how you should measure your land , what you should do if you &apos;re arrested , what you should do if your animal is sick .
This is what we teach in the night schools .
But all the schools are solar-lit .
Every five years we have an election .
Between six to 14 year-old children participate in a democratic process , and they elect a prime minister .
The prime minister is 12 years old .
She looks after 20 goats in the morning , but she &apos;s prime minister in the evening .
She has a cabinet , a minister of education , a minister for energy , a minister for health .
And they actually monitor and supervise 150 schools for 7,000 children .
She got the World &apos;s Children &apos;s Prize five years ago , and she went to Sweden .
First time ever going out of her village .
Never seen Sweden .
Wasn &apos;t dazzled at all by what was happening .
And the Queen of Sweden , who &apos;s there , turned to me and said , &quot; &quot; Can you ask this child where she got her confidence from ?
She &apos;s only 12 years old , and she &apos;s not dazzled by anything . &quot; &quot; And the girl , who &apos;s on her left , turned to me and looked at the queen straight in the eye and said , &quot; &quot; Please tell her I &apos;m the prime minister . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Where the percentage of illiteracy is very high , we use puppetry .
Puppets is the way we communicate .
You have Jokhim Chacha who is 300 years old .
He is my psychoanalyst . He is my teacher .
He &apos;s my doctor . He &apos;s my lawyer .
He &apos;s my donor .
He actually raises money , solves my disputes .
He solves my problems in the village .
If there &apos;s tension in the village , if attendance at the schools goes down and there &apos;s a friction between the teacher and the parent , the puppet calls the teacher and the parent in front of the whole village and says , &quot; &quot; Shake hands .
The attendance must not drop . &quot; &quot; These puppets are made out of recycled World Bank reports .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this decentralized , demystified approach of solar-electrifying villages , we &apos;ve covered all over India from Ladakh up to Bhutan — all solar-electrified villages by people who have been trained .
And we went to Ladakh , and we asked this woman — this , at minus 40 , you have to come out of the roof , because there &apos;s no place , it was all snowed up on both sides — and we asked this woman , &quot; &quot; What was the benefit you had from solar electricity ? &quot; &quot; And she thought for a minute and said , &quot; It &apos;s the first time I can see my husband &apos;s face in winter . &quot;
( Laughter ) Went to Afghanistan .
One lesson we learned in India was men are untrainable .
( Laughter ) Men are restless , men are ambitious , men are compulsively mobile , and they all want a certificate . ( Laughter )
All across the globe , you have this tendency of men wanting a certificate .
Why ? Because they want to leave the village and go to a city , looking for a job .
So we came up with a great solution : train grandmothers .
What &apos;s the best way of communicating in the world today ?
Television ? No .
Telegraph ? No .
Telephone ? No .
Tell a woman .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So we went to Afghanistan for the first time , and we picked three women and said , &quot; &quot; We want to take them to India . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Impossible . They don &apos;t even go out of their rooms , and you want to take them to India . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll make a concession . I &apos;ll take the husbands along as well . &quot; &quot; So I took the husbands along .
Of course , the women were much more intelligent than the men .
In six months , how do we train these women ?
Sign language .
You don &apos;t choose the written word .
You don &apos;t choose the spoken word .
You use sign language .
And in six months they can become solar engineers .
They go back and solar-electrify their own village .
This woman went back and solar-electrified the first village , set up a workshop — the first village ever to be solar-electrified in Afghanistan &#91; was &#93; by the three women . This woman
is an extraordinary grandmother .
55 years old , and she &apos;s solar-electrified 200 houses for me in Afghanistan .
And they haven &apos;t collapsed .
She actually went and spoke to an engineering department in Afghanistan and told the head of the department the difference between AC and DC .
He didn &apos;t know .
Those three women have trained 27 more women and solar-electrified 100 villages in Afghanistan .
We went to Africa , and we did the same thing .
All these women sitting at one table from eight , nine countries , all chatting to each other , not understanding a word , because they &apos;re all speaking a different language .
But their body language is great .
They &apos;re speaking to each other and actually becoming solar engineers .
I went to Sierra Leone , and there was this minister driving down in the dead of night — comes across this village .
Comes back , goes into the village , says , &quot; &quot; Well what &apos;s the story ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; These two grandmothers ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grandmothers ? &quot; &quot; The minister couldn &apos;t believe what was happening .
&quot; Where did they go ? &quot; &quot; Went to India and back . &quot;
Went straight to the president .
He said , &quot; &quot; Do you know there &apos;s a solar-electrified village in Sierra Leone ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Half the cabinet went to see the grandmothers the next day .
&quot; What &apos;s the story . &quot;
So he summoned me and said , &quot; &quot; Can you train me 150 grandmothers ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t , Mr. President .
But they will . The grandmothers will . &quot; &quot; So he built me the first Barefoot training center in Sierra Leone .
And 150 grandmothers have been trained in Sierra Leone .
Gambia : we went to select a grandmother in Gambia .
Went to this village .
I knew which woman I would like to take .
The community got together and said , &quot; &quot; Take these two women . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I want to take this woman . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Why ? She doesn &apos;t know the language . You don &apos;t know her . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I like the body language . I like the way she speaks . &quot; &quot; &quot; Difficult husband ; not possible . &quot;
Called the husband , the husband came , swaggering , politician , mobile in his hand . &quot; &quot; Not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; Why not ? &quot; &quot; The woman , look how beautiful she is . &quot;
I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , she is very beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; What happens if she runs off with an Indian man ? &quot;
That was his biggest fear .
I said , &quot; &quot; She &apos;ll be happy . She &apos;ll ring you up on the mobile . &quot; &quot; She went like a grandmother and came back like a tiger .
She walked out of the plane and spoke to the whole press as if she was a veteran .
She handled the national press , and she was a star .
And when I went back six months later , I said , &quot; &quot; Where &apos;s your husband ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , somewhere . It doesn &apos;t matter . &quot;
( Laughter ) Success story . ( Laughter )
( Applause ) I &apos;ll just wind up by saying that I think you don &apos;t have to look for solutions outside .
Look for solutions within .
And listen to people . They have the solutions in front of you .
They &apos;re all over the world .
Don &apos;t even worry .
Don &apos;t listen to the World Bank , listen to the people on the ground .
They have all the solutions in the world .
I &apos;ll end with a quotation by Mahatma Gandhi .
&quot; &quot; First they ignore you , then they laugh at you , then they fight you , and then you win . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause )
So there are lands few and far between on Earth itself that are hospitable to humans by any measure , but survive we have .
Our primitive ancestors , when they found their homes and livelihood endangered , they dared to make their way into unfamiliar territories in search of better opportunities .
And as the descendants of these explorers , we have their nomadic blood coursing through our own veins .
But at the same time , distracted by our bread and circuses and embroiled in the wars that we have waged on each other , it seems that we have forgotten this desire to explore .
We , as a species , we &apos;re evolved uniquely for Earth , on Earth , and by Earth , and so content are we with our living conditions that we have grown complacent and just too busy to notice that its resources are finite , and that our Sun &apos;s life is also finite .
While Mars and all the movies made in its name have reinvigorated the ethos for space travel , few of us seem to truly realize that our species &apos; fragile constitution is woefully unprepared for long duration journeys into space .
Let us take a trek to your local national forest for a quick reality check .
So just a quick show of hands here : how many of you think you would be able to survive in this lush wilderness for a few days ?
Well , that &apos;s a lot of you .
How about a few weeks ?
That &apos;s a decent amount .
How about a few months ?
That &apos;s pretty good too .
Now , let us imagine that this local national forest experiences an eternal winter .
Same questions : how many of you think you would be able to survive for a few days ?
That &apos;s quite a lot .
How about a few weeks ?
So for a fun twist , let us imagine that the only source of water available is trapped as frozen blocks miles below the surface .
Soil nutrients are so minimal that no vegetation can be found , and of course hardly any atmosphere exists to speak of .
Such examples are only a few of the many challenges we would face on a planet like Mars .
So how do we steel ourselves for voyages whose destinations are so far removed from a tropical vacation ?
Will we continuously ship supplies from Planet Earth ?
Build space elevators , or impossible miles of transport belts that tether your planet of choice to our home planet ?
And how do we grow things like food that grew up on Earth like us ?
But I &apos;m getting ahead of myself .
In our species &apos; journey to find a new home under a new sun , we are more likely than not going to be spending much time in the journey itself , in space , on a ship , a hermetic flying can , possibly for many generations .
The longest continuous amount of time that any human has spent in space is in the vicinity of 12 to 14 months .
From astronauts &apos; experiences in space , we know that spending time in a microgravity environment means bone loss , muscle atrophy , cardiovascular problems , among many other complications that range for the physiological to the psychological .
And what about macrogravity , or any other variation in gravitational pull of the planet that we find ourselves on ?
In short , our cosmic voyages will be fraught with dangers both known and unknown .
So far we &apos;ve been looking to this new piece of mechanical technology or that great next generation robot as part of a lineup to ensure our species safe passage in space .
Wonderful as they are , I believe the time has come for us to complement these bulky electronic giants with what nature has already invented : the microbe , a single-celled organism that is itself a self-generating , self-replenishing , living machine .
It requires fairly little to maintain , offers much flexibility in design and only asks to be carried in a single plastic tube .
The field of study that has enabled us to utilize the capabilities of the microbe is known as synthetic biology .
It comes from molecular biology , which has given us antibiotics , vaccines and better ways to observe the physiological nuances of the human body .
Using the tools of synthetic biology , we can now edit the genes of nearly any organism , microscopic or not , with incredible speed and fidelity .
Given the limitations of our man-made machines , synthetic biology will be a means for us to engineer not only our food , our fuel and our environment , but also ourselves to compensate for our physical inadequacies and to ensure our survival in space .
To give you an example of how we can use synthetic biology for space exploration , let us return to the Mars environment .
The Martian soil composition is similar to that of Hawaiian volcanic ash , with trace amounts of organic material .
Let &apos;s say , hypothetically , what if martian soil could actually support plant growth without using Earth-derived nutrients ?
The first question we should probably ask is , how would we make our plants cold-tolerant ?
Because , on average , the temperature on Mars is a very uninviting negative 60 degrees centigrade .
The next question we should ask is , how do we make our plants drought-tolerant ?
Considering that most of the water that forms as frost evaporates more quickly than I can say the word &quot; &quot; evaporate . &quot; &quot; Well , it turns out we &apos;ve already done things like this .
By borrowing genes for anti-freeze protein from fish and genes for drought tolerance from other plants like rice and then stitching them into the plants that need them , we now have plants that can tolerate most droughts and freezes .
They &apos;re known on Earth as GMOs , or genetically modified organisms , and we rely on them to feed all the mouths of human civilization .
Nature does stuff like this already , without our help .
We have simply found more precise ways to do it .
So why would we want to change the genetic makeup of plants for space ?
Well , to not do so would mean needing to engineer endless acres of land on an entirely new planet by releasing trillions of gallons of atmospheric gasses and then constructing a giant glass dome to contain it all .
It &apos;s an unrealistic engineering enterprise that quickly becomes a high-cost cargo transport mission .
One of the best ways to ensure that we will have the food supplies and the air that we need is to bring with us organisms that have been engineered to adapt to new and harsh environments .
In essence , using engineered organisms to help us terraform a planet both in the short and long term .
These organisms can then also be engineered to make medicine or fuel .
So we can use synthetic biology to bring highly engineered plants with us , but what else can we do ?
Well , I mentioned earlier that we , as a species , were evolved uniquely for planet Earth .
That fact has not changed much in the last five minutes that you were sitting here and I was standing there .
And so , if we were to dump any of us on Mars right this minute , even given ample food , water , air and a suit , we are likely to experience very unpleasant health problems from the amount of ionizing radiation that bombards the surface of planets like Mars that have little or nonexistent atmosphere .
Unless we plan to stay holed up underground for the duration of our stay on every new planet , we must find better ways of protecting ourselves without needing to resort to wearing a suit of armor that weighs something equal to your own body weight , or needing to hide behind a wall of lead .
So let us appeal to nature for inspiration .
Among the plethora of life here on Earth , there &apos;s a subset of organisms known as extremophiles , or lovers of extreme living conditions , if you &apos;ll remember from high school biology .
And among these organisms is a bacterium by the name of Deinococcus radiodurans .
It is known to be able to withstand cold , dehydration , vacuum , acid , and , most notably , radiation .
While its radiation tolerance mechanisms are known , we have yet to adapt the relevant genes to mammals .
To do so is not particularly easy .
There are many facets that go into its radiation tolerance , and it &apos;s not as simple as transferring one gene .
But given a little bit of human ingenuity and a little bit of time , I think to do so is not very hard either .
Even if we borrow just a fraction of its ability to tolerate radiation , it would be infinitely better than what we already have , which is just the melanin in our skin .
Using the tools of synthetic biology , we can harness Deinococcus radiodurans &apos; ability to thrive under otherwise very lethal doses of radiation .
As difficult as it is to see , homo sapiens , that is humans , evolves every day , and still continues to evolve .
Thousands of years of human evolution has not only given us humans like Tibetans , who can thrive in low-oxygen conditions , but also Argentinians , who can ingest and metabolize arsenic , the chemical element that can kill the average human being .
Every day , the human body evolves by accidental mutations that equally accidentally allow certain humans to persevere in dismal situations .
But , and this is a big but , such evolution requires two things that we may not always have , or be able to afford , and they are death and time .
In our species &apos; struggle to find our place in the universe , we may not always have the time necessary for the natural evolution of extra functions for survival on non-Earth planets .
We &apos;re living in what E.O. Wilson has termed the age of gene circumvention , during which we remedy our genetic defects like cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy with temporary external supplements .
But with every passing day , we approach the age of volitional evolution , a time during which we as a species will have the capacity to decide for ourselves our own genetic destiny .
Augmenting the human body with new abilities is no longer a question of how , but of when .
Using synthetic biology to change the genetic makeup of any living organisms , especially our own , is not without its moral and ethical quandaries .
Will engineering ourselves make us less human ?
But then again , what is humanity but star stuff that happens to be conscious ?
Where should human genius direct itself ?
Surely it is a bit of a waste to sit back and marvel at it .
How do we use our knowledge to protect ourselves from the external dangers and then protect ourselves from ourselves ?
I pose these questions not to engender the fear of science but to bring to light the many possibilities that science has afforded and continues to afford us .
We must coalesce as humans to discuss and embrace the solutions not only with caution but also with courage .
Mars is a destination , but it will not be our last .
Our true final frontier is the line we must cross in deciding what we can and should make of our species &apos; improbable intelligence .
Space is cold , brutal and unforgiving .
Our path to the stars will be rife with trials that will bring us to question not only who we are but where we will be going .
The answers will lie in our choice to use or abandon the technology that we have gleaned from life itself , and it will define us for the remainder of our term in this universe .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Thank you very much .
Please excuse me for sitting ; I &apos;m very old .
( Laughter ) Well , the topic I &apos;m going to discuss is one which is , in a certain sense , very peculiar because it &apos;s very old .
Roughness is part of human life forever and forever , and ancient authors have written about it .
It was very much uncontrollable , and in a certain sense , it seemed to be the extreme of complexity , just a mess , a mess and a mess .
There are many different kinds of mess .
Now , in fact , by a complete fluke , I got involved many years ago in a study of this form of complexity , and to my utter amazement , I found traces — very strong traces , I must say — of order in that roughness .
And so today , I would like to present to you a few examples of what this represents .
I prefer the word roughness to the word irregularity because irregularity — to someone who had Latin in my long-past youth — means the contrary of regularity .
But it is not so .
Regularity is the contrary of roughness because the basic aspect of the world is very rough .
So let me show you a few objects .
Some of them are artificial .
Others of them are very real , in a certain sense .
Now this is the real . It &apos;s a cauliflower .
Now why do I show a cauliflower , a very ordinary and ancient vegetable ?
Because old and ancient as it may be , it &apos;s very complicated and it &apos;s very simple , both at the same time .
If you try to weigh it — of course it &apos;s very easy to weigh it , and when you eat it , the weight matters — but suppose you try to measure its surface .
Well , it &apos;s very interesting .
If you cut , with a sharp knife , one of the florets of a cauliflower and look at it separately , you think of a whole cauliflower , but smaller .
And then you cut again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , and you still get small cauliflowers .
So the experience of humanity has always been that there are some shapes which have this peculiar property , that each part is like the whole , but smaller .
Now , what did humanity do with that ?
Very , very little .
( Laughter ) So what I did actually is to study this problem , and I found something quite surprising .
That one can measure roughness by a number , a number , 2.3 , 1.2 and sometimes much more .
One day , a friend of mine , to bug me , brought a picture and said , &quot; What is the roughness of this curve ? &quot;
I said , &quot; &quot; Well , just short of 1.5 . &quot; &quot; It was 1.48 .
Now , it didn &apos;t take me any time .
I &apos;ve been looking at these things for so long .
So these numbers are the numbers which denote the roughness of these surfaces .
I hasten to say that these surfaces are completely artificial .
They were done on a computer , and the only input is a number , and that number is roughness .
So on the left , I took the roughness copied from many landscapes .
To the right , I took a higher roughness .
So the eye , after a while , can distinguish these two very well .
Humanity had to learn about measuring roughness .
This is very rough , and this is sort of smooth , and this perfectly smooth .
Very few things are very smooth .
So then if you try to ask questions : &quot; What &apos;s the surface of a cauliflower ? &quot;
Well , you measure and measure and measure .
Each time you &apos;re closer , it gets bigger , down to very , very small distances .
What &apos;s the length of the coastline of these lakes ?
The closer you measure , the longer it is .
The concept of length of coastline , which seems to be so natural because it &apos;s given in many cases , is , in fact , complete fallacy ; there &apos;s no such thing .
You must do it differently .
What good is that , to know these things ?
Well , surprisingly enough , it &apos;s good in many ways .
To begin with , artificial landscapes , which I invented sort of , are used in cinema all the time .
We see mountains in the distance .
They may be mountains , but they may be just formulae , just cranked on .
Now it &apos;s very easy to do .
It used to be very time-consuming , but now it &apos;s nothing .
Now look at that . That &apos;s a real lung .
Now a lung is something very strange .
If you take this thing , you know very well it weighs very little .
The volume of a lung is very small , but what about the area of the lung ?
Anatomists were arguing very much about that .
Some say that a normal male &apos;s lung has an area of the inside of a basketball &#91; court &#93; .
And the others say , no , five basketball &#91; courts &#93; .
Enormous disagreements .
Why so ? Because , in fact , the area of the lung is something very ill-defined .
The bronchi branch , branch , branch and they stop branching , not because of any matter of principle , but because of physical considerations : the mucus , which is in the lung .
So what happens is that in a way you have a much bigger lung , but it branches and branches down to distances about the same for a whale , for a man and for a little rodent .
Now , what good is it to have that ?
Well , surprisingly enough , amazingly enough , the anatomists had a very poor idea of the structure of the lung until very recently .
And I think that my mathematics , surprisingly enough , has been of great help to the surgeons studying lung illnesses and also kidney illnesses , all these branching systems , for which there was no geometry .
So I found myself , in other words , constructing a geometry , a geometry of things which had no geometry .
And a surprising aspect of it is that very often , the rules of this geometry are extremely short .
You have formulas that long .
And you crank it several times .
Sometimes repeatedly : again , again , again , the same repetition .
And at the end , you get things like that .
This cloud is completely , 100 percent artificial .
Well , 99.9 .
And the only part which is natural is a number , the roughness of the cloud , which is taken from nature .
Something so complicated like a cloud , so unstable , so varying , should have a simple rule behind it .
Now this simple rule is not an explanation of clouds .
The seer of clouds had to take account of it .
I don &apos;t know how much advanced these pictures are . They &apos;re old .
I was very much involved in it , but then turned my attention to other phenomena .
Now , here is another thing which is rather interesting .
One of the shattering events in the history of mathematics , which is not appreciated by many people , occurred about 130 years ago , 145 years ago .
Mathematicians began to create shapes that didn &apos;t exist .
Mathematicians got into self-praise to an extent which was absolutely amazing , that man can invent things that nature did not know .
In particular , it could invent things like a curve which fills the plane .
A curve &apos;s a curve , a plane &apos;s a plane , and the two won &apos;t mix .
Well , they do mix .
A man named Peano did define such curves , and it became an object of extraordinary interest .
It was very important , but mostly interesting because a kind of break , a separation between the mathematics coming from reality , on the one hand , and new mathematics coming from pure man &apos;s mind .
Well , I was very sorry to point out that the pure man &apos;s mind has , in fact , seen at long last what had been seen for a long time .
And so here I introduce something , the set of rivers of a plane-filling curve .
And well , it &apos;s a story unto itself .
So it was in 1875 to 1925 , an extraordinary period in which mathematics prepared itself to break out from the world .
And the objects which were used as examples , when I was a child and a student , as examples of the break between mathematics and visible reality — those objects , I turned them completely around .
I used them for describing some of the aspects of the complexity of nature .
Well , a man named Hausdorff in 1919 introduced a number which was just a mathematical joke , and I found that this number was a good measurement of roughness .
When I first told it to my friends in mathematics they said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be silly . It &apos;s just something &#91; silly &#93; . &quot; &quot; Well actually , I was not silly .
The great painter Hokusai knew it very well .
The things on the ground are algae .
He did not know the mathematics ; it didn &apos;t yet exist .
And he was Japanese who had no contact with the West .
But painting for a long time had a fractal side .
I could speak of that for a long time .
The Eiffel Tower has a fractal aspect .
I read the book that Mr. Eiffel wrote about his tower , and indeed it was astonishing how much he understood .
This is a mess , mess , mess , Brownian loop .
One day I decided — halfway through my career , I was held by so many things in my work — I decided to test myself .
Could I just look at something which everybody had been looking at for a long time and find something dramatically new ?
Well , so I looked at these things called Brownian motion — just goes around .
I played with it for a while , and I made it return to the origin .
Then I was telling my assistant , &quot; I don &apos;t see anything . Can you paint it ? &quot;
So he painted it , which means he put inside everything . He said : &quot; &quot; Well , this thing came out ... &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Stop ! Stop ! Stop !
I see ; it &apos;s an island . &quot; &quot; And amazing .
So Brownian motion , which happens to have a roughness number of two , goes around .
I measured it , 1.33 .
Again , again , again .
Long measurements , big Brownian motions , 1.33 .
Mathematical problem : how to prove it ?
It took my friends 20 years .
Three of them were having incomplete proofs .
They got together , and together they had the proof .
So they got the big &#91; Fields &#93; medal in mathematics , one of the three medals that people have received for proving things which I &apos;ve seen without being able to prove them .
Now everybody asks me at one point or another , &quot; &quot; How did it all start ?
What got you in that strange business ? &quot; &quot; What got you to be , at the same time , a mechanical engineer , a geographer and a mathematician and so on , a physicist ?
Well actually I started , oddly enough , studying stock market prices .
And so here I had this theory , and I wrote books about it — financial prices increments .
To the left you see data over a long period .
To the right , on top , you see a theory which is very , very fashionable .
It was very easy , and you can write many books very fast about it .
( Laughter ) There are thousands of books on that .
Now compare that with real price increments .
Where are real price increments ?
Well , these other lines include some real price increments and some forgery which I did .
So the idea there was that one must be able to — how do you say ? — model price variation .
And it went really well 50 years ago .
For 50 years , people were sort of pooh-poohing me because they could do it much , much easier .
But I tell you , at this point , people listened to me .
( Laughter ) These two curves are averages : Standard &amp; Poor , the blue one ; and the red one is Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s from which the five biggest discontinuities are taken out .
Now discontinuities are a nuisance , so in many studies of prices , one puts them aside .
&quot; &quot; Well , acts of God .
And you have the little nonsense which is left .
Acts of God . &quot; &quot; In this picture , five acts of God are as important as everything else .
In other words , it is not acts of God that we should put aside .
That is the meat , the problem .
If you master these , you master price , and if you don &apos;t master these , you can master the little noise as well as you can , but it &apos;s not important .
Well , here are the curves for it .
Now , I get to the final thing , which is the set of which my name is attached .
In a way , it &apos;s the story of my life .
My adolescence was spent during the German occupation of France .
Since I thought that I might vanish within a day or a week , I had very big dreams .
And after the war , I saw an uncle again .
My uncle was a very prominent mathematician , and he told me , &quot; &quot; Look , there &apos;s a problem which I could not solve 25 years ago , and which nobody can solve .
This is a construction of a man named &#91; Gaston &#93; Julia and &#91; Pierre &#93; Fatou .
If you could find something new , anything , you will get your career made . &quot; &quot; Very simple .
So I looked , and like the thousands of people that had tried before , I found nothing .
But then the computer came , and I decided to apply the computer , not to new problems in mathematics — like this wiggle wiggle , that &apos;s a new problem — but to old problems .
And I went from what &apos;s called real numbers , which are points on a line , to imaginary , complex numbers , which are points on a plane , which is what one should do there , and this shape came out .
This shape is of an extraordinary complication .
The equation is hidden there , z goes into z squared , plus c .
It &apos;s so simple , so dry .
It &apos;s so uninteresting .
Now you turn the crank once , twice : twice , marvels come out .
I mean this comes out .
I don &apos;t want to explain these things .
This comes out . This comes out .
Shapes which are of such complication , such harmony and such beauty .
This comes out repeatedly , again , again , again .
And that was one of my major discoveries , to find that these islands were the same as the whole big thing , more or less .
And then you get these extraordinary baroque decorations all over the place .
All that from this little formula , which has whatever , five symbols in it .
And then this one .
The color was added for two reasons .
First of all , because these shapes are so complicated that one couldn &apos;t make any sense of the numbers .
And if you plot them , you must choose some system .
And so my principle has been to always present the shapes with different colorings because some colorings emphasize that , and others it is that or that .
It &apos;s so complicated .
( Laughter ) In 1990 , I was in Cambridge , U.K.
to receive a prize from the university , and three days later , a pilot was flying over the landscape and found this thing .
So where did this come from ?
Obviously , from extraterrestrials .
( Laughter ) Well , so the newspaper in Cambridge published an article about that &quot; &quot; discovery &quot; &quot; and received the next day 5,000 letters from people saying , &quot; But that &apos;s simply a Mandelbrot set very big . &quot;
Well , let me finish .
This shape here just came out of an exercise in pure mathematics .
Bottomless wonders spring from simple rules , which are repeated without end .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
We live on a human-dominated planet , putting unprecedented pressure on the systems on Earth .
This is bad news , but perhaps surprising to you , it &apos;s also part of the good news .
We &apos;re the first generation — thanks to science — to be informed that we may be undermining the stability and the ability of planet Earth to support human development as we know it .
It &apos;s also good news , because the planetary risks we &apos;re facing are so large , that business as usual is not an option .
In fact , we &apos;re in a phase where transformative change is necessary , which opens the window for innovation , for new ideas and new paradigms .
This is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity in the global phase of sustainability .
On this journey , I &apos;d like to bring , apart from yourselves , a good friend , a stakeholder , who &apos;s always absent when we deal with the negotiations on environmental issues , a stakeholder who refuses to compromise — planet Earth .
So I thought I &apos;d bring her with me today on stage , to have her as a witness of a remarkable journey , which humbly reminds us of the period of grace we &apos;ve had over the past 10,000 years .
This is the living conditions on the planet over the last 100,000 years .
It &apos;s a very important period — it &apos;s roughly half the period when we &apos;ve been fully modern humans on the planet .
We &apos;ve had the same , roughly , abilities that developed civilizations as we know it .
This is the environmental conditions on the planet .
Here , used as a proxy , temperature variability .
It was a jumpy ride . 80,000 years back in a crisis , we leave Africa , we colonize Australia in another crisis , 60,000 years back , we leave Asia for Europe in another crisis , 40,000 years back , and then we enter the remarkably stable Holocene phase , the only period in the whole history of the planet , that we know of , that can support human development .
A thousand years into this period , we abandon our hunting and gathering patterns .
We go from a couple of million people to the seven billion people we are today .
The Mesopotamian culture : we invent agriculture , we domesticate animals and plants .
You have the Roman , the Greek and the story as you know it .
The only phase , as we know it that can support humanity .
The trouble is we &apos;re putting a quadruple sqeeze on this poor planet , a quadruple sqeeze , which , as its first squeeze , has population growth of course .
Now , this is not only about numbers ; this is not only about the fact that we &apos;re seven billion people committed to nine billion people , it &apos;s an equity issue as well .
The majority of the environmental impacts on the planet have been caused by the rich minority , the 20 percent that jumped onto the industrial bandwagon in the mid-18th century .
The majority of the planet , aspiring for development , having the right for development , are in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle , a momentous pressure .
The second pressure on the planet is , of course the climate agenda — the big issue — where the policy interpretation of science is that it would be enough to stabilize greenhouse gases at 450 ppm to avoid average temperatures exceeding two degrees , to avoid the risk that we may be destabilizing the West Antarctic Ice Sheet , holding six meters — level rising , the risk of destabilizing the Greenland Ice Sheet , holding another seven meters — sea level rising .
Now , you would have wished the climate pressure to hit a strong planet , a resilient planet , but unfortunately , the third pressure is the ecosystem decline .
Never have we seen , in the past 50 years , such a sharp decline of ecosystem functions and services on the planet , one of them being the ability to regulate climate on the long term , in our forests , land and biodiversity .
The forth pressure is surprise , the notion and the evidence that we need to abandon our old paradigm , that ecosystems behave linearly , predictably , controllably in our — so to say — linear systems , and that in fact , surprise is universal , as systems tip over very rapidly , abruptly and often irreversibly .
This , dear friends , poses a human pressure on the planet of momentous scale .
We may , in fact , have entered a new geological era — the Anthropocene , where humans are the predominant driver of change at a planetary level .
Now , as a scientist , what &apos;s the evidence for this ?
Well , the evidence is , unfortunately , ample .
It &apos;s not only carbon dioxide that has this hockey stick pattern of accelerated change .
You can take virtually any parameter that matters for human well-being — nitrous oxide , methane , deforestation , overfishing land degredation , loss of species — they all show the same pattern over the past 200 years .
Simultaneously , they branch off in the mid-50s , 10 years after the Second World War , showing very clearly that the great acceleration of the human enterprise starts in the mid-50s .
You see , for the first time , an imprint on the global level .
And I can tell you , you enter the disciplinary research in each of these , you find something remarkably important , the conclusion that we may have come to the point where we have to bend the curves , that we may have entered the most challenging and exciting decade in the history humanity on the planet , the decade when we have to bend the curves .
Now , as if this was not enough — to just bend the curves and understanding the accelerated pressure on the planet — we also have to recognize the fact that systems do have multiple stable states , separated by thresholds — illustrated here by this ball and cup diagram , where the depth of the cup is the resilience of the system .
Now , the system may gradually — under pressure of climate change , erosion , biodiversity loss — lose the depth of the cup , the resilience , but appear to be healthy and appear to suddenly , under a threshold , be tipping over . Upff .
Sorry . Changing state and literally ending up in an undesired situation , where new biophysical logic takes over , new species take over , and the system gets locked .
Do we have evidence of this ? Yes , coral reef systems .
Biodiverse , low-nutrient , hard coral systems under multiple pressures of overfishing , unsustainable tourism , climate change .
A trigger and the system tips over , loses its resilience , soft corals take over , and we get undesired systems that cannot support economic and social development .
The Arctic — a beautiful system — a regulating biome at the planetary level , taking the knock after knock on climate change , appearing to be in a good state .
No scientist could predict that in 2007 , suddenly , what could be crossing a threshold .
The system suddenly , very surprisingly , loses 30 to 40 percent of its summer ice cover .
And the drama is , of course , that when the system does this , the logic may change .
It may get locked in an undesired state , because it changes color , absorbs more energy , and the system may get stuck .
In my mind , the largest red flag warning for humanity that we are in a precarious situation .
As a sideline , you know that the only red flag that popped up here was a submarine from an unnamed country that planted a red flag at the bottom of the Arctic to be able to control the oil resources .
Now , if we have evidence , which we now have , that wetlands , forests , &#91; unclear &#93; monsoon system , the rainforests , behave in this nonlinear way .
30 or so scientists around the world gathered and asked a question for the first time , &quot; Do we have to put the planet into the the pot ? &quot;
So we have to ask ourselves : are we threatening this extraordinarily stable Holocene state ?
Are we in fact putting ourselves in a situation where we &apos;re coming too close to thresholds that could lead to deleterious and very undesired , if now catastrophic , change for human development ?
You know , you don &apos;t want to stand there .
In fact , you &apos;re not even allowed to stand where this gentleman is standing , at the foaming , slippery waters at the threshold .
In fact , there &apos;s a fence quite upstream of this threshold , beyond which you are in a danger zone .
And this is the new paradigm , which we gathered two , three years back , recognizing that our old paradigm of just analyzing and pushing and predicting parameters into the future , aiming at minimalizing environmental impacts , is of the past .
Now we to ask ourselves : which are the large environmental processes that we have to be stewards of to keep ourselves safe in the Holocene ?
And could we even , thanks to major advancements in Earth systems science , identify the thresholds , the points where we may expect nonlinear change ?
And could we even define a planetary boundary , a fence , within which we then have a safe operating space for humanity ?
This work , which was published in &quot; &quot; Nature , &quot; &quot; late 2009 , after a number of years of analysis , led to the final proposition that we can only find nine planetary boundaries with which , under active stewardship , would allow ourselves to have a safe operating space .
These include , of course , climate .
It may surprise you that it &apos;s not only climate .
But it shows that we are interconnected , among many systems on the planet , with the three big systems , climate change , stratospheric ozone depletion and ocean acidification being the three big systems , where the scientific evidence of large-scale thresholds in the paleo-record of the history of the planet .
But we also include , what we call , the slow variables , the systems that , under the hood , regulate and buffer the capacity of the resilience of the planet — the interference of the big nitrogen and phosphorus cycles on the planet , land use change , rate of biodiversity loss , freshwater use , functions which regulate biomass on the planet , carbon sequestration , diversity .
And then we have two parameters which we were not able to quantify — air pollution , including warming gases and air-polluting sulfates and nitrates , but also chemical pollution .
Together , these form an integrated whole for guiding human development in the Anthropocene , understanding that the planet is a complex self-regulating system .
In fact , most evidence indicates that these nine may behave as three Musketeers , &quot; One for all . All for one . &quot;
You degrade forests , you go beyond the boundary on land , you undermine the ability of the climate system to stay stable .
The drama here is , in fact , that it may show that the climate challenge is the easy one , if you consider the whole challenge of sustainable development .
Now this is the Big Bang equivalent then of human development within the safe operating space of the planetary boundaries .
What you see here in black line is the safe operating space , the quantified boundaries , as suggested by this analysis .
The yellow dot in the middle here is our starting point , the pre-industrial point , where we &apos;re very safely in the safe operating space .
In the &apos; 50s , we start branching out .
In the &apos; 60s already , through the green revolution and the Haber-Bosch process of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere — you know , human &apos;s today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere than the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole .
We don &apos;t transgress the climate boundary until the early &apos; 90s , actually , right after Rio .
And today , we are in a situation where we estimate that we &apos;ve transgressed three boundaries , the rate of biodiversity loss , which is the sixth extinction period in the history of humanity — one of them being the extinctions of the dinosaurs — nitrogen and climate change .
But we still have some degrees of freedom on the others , but we are approaching fast on land , water , phosphorus and oceans .
But this gives a new paradigm to guide humanity , to put the light on our , so far overpowered industrial vehicle , which operates as if we &apos;re only on a dark , straight highway .
Now the question then is : how gloomy is this ?
Is then sustainable development utopia ?
Well , there &apos;s no science to suggest .
In fact , there is ample science to indicate that we can do this transformative change , that we have the ability to now move into a new innovative , a transformative gear , across scales .
The drama is , of course , is that 200 countries on this planet have to simultaneously start moving in the same direction .
But it changes fundamentally our governance and management paradigm , from the current linear , command and control thinking , looking at efficiencies and optimization towards a much more flexible , a much more adaptive approach , where we recognize that redundancy , both in social and environmental systems , is key to be able to deal with a turbulent era of global change .
We have to invest in persistence , in the ability of social systems and ecological systems to withstand shocks and still remain in that desired cup .
We have to invest in transformations capability , moving from crisis into innovation and the ability to rise after a crisis , and of course to adapt to unavoidable change .
This is a new paradigm .
We &apos;re not doing that at any scale on governance .
But is it happening anywhere ?
Do we have any examples of success on this mind shift being applied at the local level ?
Well , yes , in fact we do and the list can start becoming longer and longer .
There &apos;s good news here , for example , from Latin America , where plow-based farming systems of the &apos; 50s and &apos; 60s led farming basically to a dead-end , with lower and lower yields , degrading the organic matter and fundamental problems at the livelihood levels in Paraguay , Uruguay and a number of countries , Brazil , leading to innovation and entrepreneurship among farmers in partnership with scientists into an agricultural revolution of zero tillage systems combined with mulch farming with locally adapted technologies , which today , for example , in some countries , have led to a tremendous increase in area under mulch , zero till farming which , not only produces more food ,
but also sequesters carbon .
The Australian Great Barrier Reef is another success story .
Under the realization from tourist operators , fishermen , the Australian Great Barrier Reef Authority and scientists that the Great Barrier Reef is doomed under the current governance regime .
Global change , beautification rack culture , overfishing and unsustainable tourism , all together placing this system in the realization of crisis .
But the window of opportunity was innovation and new mindset , which today has led to a completely new governance strategy to build resilience , acknowledge redundancy and invest in the whole system as an integrated whole , and then allow for much more redundancy in the system .
Sweden , the country I come from , has other examples , where wetlands in southern Sweden were seen as — as in many countries — as flood-prone polluted nuisance in the peri-urban regions .
But again , a crisis , new partnerships , actors locally , transforming these into a key component of sustainable urban planning .
So crisis leading into opportunities .
Now , what about the future ?
Well , the future , of course , has one massive challenge , which is feeding a world of nine billion people .
We need nothing less than a new green revolution , and the planet boundaries shows that agriculture has to go from a source of greenhouse gases to a sink .
It has to basically do this on current land .
We cannot expand anymore , because it erodes the planetary boundaries .
We cannot continue consuming water as we do today , with 25 percent of world rivers not even reaching the ocean .
And we need a transformation .
Well , interestingly , and based on my work and others in Africa , for example , we &apos;ve shown that even the most vulnerable small-scale rainfall farming systems , with innovations and supplementary irrigation to bridge dry spells and droughts , sustainable sanitation systems to close the loop on nutrients from toilets back to farmers &apos; fields , and innovations in tillage systems , we can triple , quadruple , yield levels on current land .
Elinor Ostrom , the latest Nobel laureate of economics , clearly shows empirically across the world that we can govern the commons if we invest in trust , local , action-based partnerships and cross-scale institutional innovations , where local actors , together , can deal with the global commons at a large scale .
But even on the hard policy area we have innovations .
We know that we have to move from our fossil dependence very quickly into a low-carbon economy in record time .
And what shall we do ?
Everybody talks about carbon taxes — it won &apos;t work — emission schemes , but for example , one policy measure , feed-in tariffs on the energy system , which is already applied , from China doing it on offshore wind systems , all the way to the U.S.
where you give the guaranteed price for investment in renewable energy , but you can subsidize electricity to poor people .
You get people out of poverty .
You solve the climate issue with regards to the energy sector , while at the same time , stimulating innovation — examples of things that can be out scaled quickly at the planetary level .
So there is — no doubt — opportunity here , and we can list many , many examples of transformative opportunities around the planet .
The key though in all of these , the red thread , is the shift in mindset , moving away from a situation where we simply are pushing ourselves into a dark future , where we instead backcast our future , and we say , &quot; &quot; What is the playing field on the planet ?
What are the planetary boundaries within which we can safely operate ? &quot; &quot; and then backtrack innovations within that .
But of course , the drama is , it clearly shows that incremental change is not an option .
So , there is scientific evidence .
They sort of say the harsh news , that we are facing the largest transformative development since the industrialization .
In fact , what we have to do over the next 40 years is much more dramatic and more exciting than what we did when we moved into the situation we &apos;re in today .
Now , science indicates that , yes , we can achieve a prosperous future within the safe operating space , if we move simultaneously , collaborating on a global level , from local to global scale , in transformative options , which build resilience on a finite planet .
Thank you .

I &apos;m here because I have a very important message : I think we have found the most important factor for success .
And it was found close to here , Stanford .
Psychology professor took kids that were four years old and put them in a room all by themselves .
And he would tell the child , a four-year-old kid , &quot; &quot; Johnny , I am going to leave you here with a marshmallow for 15 minutes .
If , after I come back , this marshmallow is here , you will get another one . So you will have two . &quot; &quot; To tell a four-year-old kid to wait 15 minutes for something that they like , is equivalent to telling us , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll bring you coffee in two hours . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Exact equivalent .
So what happened when the professor left the room ?
As soon as the door closed ...
two out of three ate the marshmallow .
Five seconds , 10 seconds , 40 seconds , 50 seconds , two minutes , four minutes , eight minutes .
Some lasted 14-and-a-half minutes .
( Laughter ) Couldn &apos;t do it . Could not wait .
What &apos;s interesting is that one out of three would look at the marshmallow and go like this ...
Would look at it .
Put it back .
They would walk around . They would play with their skirts and pants .
That child already , at four , understood the most important principle for success , which is the ability to delay gratification .
Self-discipline : the most important factor for success .
15 years later , 14 or 15 years later , follow-up study .
What did they find ?
They went to look for these kids who were now 18 and 19 .
And they found that 100 percent of the children that had not eaten the marshmallow were successful .
They had good grades . They were doing wonderful .
They were happy . They had their plans .
They had good relationships with the teachers , students .
They were doing fine .
A great percentage of the kids that ate the marshmallow , they were in trouble .
They did not make it to university .
They had bad grades . Some of them dropped out .
A few were still there with bad grades .
A few had good grades .
I had a question in my mind : Would Hispanic kids react the same way as the American kids ?
So I went to Colombia . And I reproduced the experiment .
And it was very funny . I used four , five and six years old kids .
And let me show you what happened .
( Spanish ) ( Laughter ) So what happened in Colombia ?
Hispanic kids , two out of three ate the marshmallow ; one out of three did not .
This little girl was interesting ; she ate the inside of the marshmallow .
( Laughter ) In other words , she wanted us to think that she had not eaten it , so she would get two .
But she ate it .
So we know she &apos;ll be successful . But we have to watch her .
( Laughter ) She should not go into banking , for example , or work at a cash register .
But she will be successful .
And this applies for everything . Even in sales .
The sales person that — the customer says , &quot; &quot; I want that . &quot; &quot; And the person says , &quot; &quot; Okay , here you are . &quot; &quot; That person ate the marshmallow .
If the sales person says , &quot; &quot; Wait a second .
Let me ask you a few questions to see if this is a good choice . &quot; &quot; Then you sell a lot more .
So this has applications in all walks of life .
I end with — the Koreans did this .
You know what ? This is so good that we want a marshmallow book for children .
We did one for children . And now it is all over Korea .
They are teaching these kids exactly this principle .
And we need to learn that principle here in the States , because we have a big debt .
We are eating more marshmallows than we are producing .
Thank you so much .
I am a writer .
Writing books is my profession but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It is also my great lifelong love and fascination .
And I don &apos;t expect that that &apos;s ever going to change .
But , that said , something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career , which has caused me to have to recalibrate my whole relationship with this work .
And the peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book , this memoir called &quot; &quot; Eat , Pray , Love &quot; &quot; which , decidedly unlike any of my previous books , went out in the world for some reason , and became this big , mega-sensation , international bestseller thing .
The result of which is that everywhere I go now , people treat me like I &apos;m doomed .
Seriously — doomed , doomed !
The answer — the short answer to all those questions is , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; Yes , I &apos;m afraid of all those things .
And I always have been .
And what is it specifically about creative ventures that seems to make us really nervous about each other &apos;s mental health in a way that other careers kind of don &apos;t do , you know ?
Like my dad , for example , was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t recall once in his 40 years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer , you know ?
&quot; That chemical-engineering block , John , how &apos;s it going ? &quot;
It just didn &apos;t come up like that , you know ?
( Laughter ) We writers , we kind of do have that reputation , and not just writers , but creative people across all genres , it seems , have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable .
And all you have to do is look at the very grim death count in the 20th century alone , of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands , you know ?
And even the ones who didn &apos;t literally commit suicide seem to be really undone by their gifts , you know .
Norman Mailer , just before he died , last interview , he said , &quot; Every one of my books has killed me a little more . &quot;
An extraordinary statement to make about your life &apos;s work .
But we don &apos;t even blink when we hear somebody say this , because we &apos;ve heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we &apos;ve completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry , in the end , will always ultimately lead to anguish .
Are you comfortable with that ?
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I also think it &apos;s dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see it perpetuated into the next century .
Which is — you know , like check it out , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m only about 40 years old .
I should just put it bluntly , because we &apos;re all sort of friends here now — it &apos;s exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me .
So Jesus , what a thought !
And so , it seems to me , upon a lot of reflection , that the way that I have to work now , in order to continue writing , is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct , right ?
And that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome .
So stay with me , because it does circle around and back .
People believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source , for distant and unknowable reasons .
The Greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity &quot; &quot; daemons . &quot; &quot; Socrates , famously , believed that he had a daemon who spoke wisdom to him from afar .
The Romans had the same idea , but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius .
And everyone knew that this is how it functioned , right ?
If your work bombed , not entirely your fault , you know ?
Everyone knew your genius was kind of lame .
And I got to tell you , I think that was a huge error .
It &apos;s like asking somebody to swallow the sun .
It just completely warps and distorts egos , and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance .
And I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it is true , the question becomes , what now ?
Can we do this differently ?
Maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery .
Maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought in one 18 minute speech .
And there &apos;s probably people in this audience who would raise really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of , basically , fairies who follow people around rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff .
I &apos;m not , probably , going to bring you all along with me on this .
But the question that I kind of want to pose is — you know , why not ?
Why not think about it this way ?
Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process .
And , in fact , can sometimes feel downright paranormal .
And she said it was like a thunderous train of air .
And it would come barreling down at her over the landscape .
And in these instances , the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards , from the last word to the first .
( Laughter ) So when I heard that I was like — that &apos;s uncanny , that &apos;s exactly what my creative process is like . ( Laughter )
That &apos;s not at all what my creative process is — I &apos;m not the pipeline !
And I would imagine that a lot of you have too .
And what is that thing ?
And how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds , but , in fact , might actually keep us sane ?
And for me , the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that is the musician Tom Waits , who I got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment .
But then he got older , he got calmer , and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles , and this is when it all changed for him .
He just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Do I look like I can write down a song right now ?
If you really want to exist , come back at a more opportune moment when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , go bother somebody else today .
Go bother Leonard Cohen . &quot; &quot; And his whole work process changed after that .
Not the work , the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever .
But then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I tried it .
So I just lifted my face up from the manuscript and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room .
And I said aloud , &quot; &quot; Listen you , thing , you and I both know that if this book isn &apos;t brilliant that is not entirely my fault , right ?
And all of a sudden , he would no longer appear to be merely human .
And when this happened , back then , people knew it for what it was , you know , they called it by its name .
That &apos;s God , you know .
In Spain , when a performer has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , olé , olé , Allah , magnificent , bravo , &quot; incomprehensible , there it is — a glimpse of God .
He &apos;s just an aging mortal with really bad knees , and maybe he &apos;s never going to ascend to that height again .
And maybe nobody will ever chant God &apos;s name again as he spins , and what is he then to do with the rest of his life ?
This is hard .
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite so full of anguish if you never happened to believe , in the first place , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you .
And what I have to sort of keep telling myself when I get really psyched out about that is don &apos;t be afraid .
Don &apos;t be daunted . Just do your job .
Continue to show up for your piece of it , whatever that might be .
And &quot; &quot; Olé ! &quot; &quot; to you , nonetheless .
I believe this and I feel that we must teach it .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
June Cohen : Olé ! ( Applause )
He was an economically rational person .
Might fail , kid . Don &apos;t make a lot of money at that , kid .
So this right here is the tiny village of Elle , close to Lista .
It &apos;s right at the southernmost tip of Norway .
And on January 2 this year , an elderly guy who lives in the village , he went out to see what was cast ashore during a recent storm .
And on a patch of grass right next to the water &apos;s edge , he found a wetsuit .
It was grey and black , and he thought it looked cheap .
Out of each leg of the wetsuit there were sticking two white bones .
It was clearly the remains of a human being .
And usually , in Norway , dead people are identified quickly .
So the police started searching through missing reports from the local area , national missing reports , and looked for accidents with a possible connection .
They found nothing .
So they ran a DNA profile , and they started searching internationally through Interpol .
Nothing .
This was a person that nobody seemed to be missing .
It was an invisible life heading for a nameless grave .
But then , after a month , the police in Norway got a message from the police in the Netherlands .
A couple of months earlier , they had found a body , in an identical wetsuit , and they had no idea who this person was .
But the police in the Netherlands managed to trace the wetsuit by an RFID chip that was sewn in the suit .
So they were then able to tell that both wetsuits were bought by the same customer at the same time , October 7 , 2014 , in the French city of Calais by the English Channel .
But this was all they were able to figure out .
The customer paid cash .
There was no surveillance footage from the shop .
So it became a cold case .
We heard this story , and it triggered me and my colleague , photographer Tomm Christiansen , and we of course had the obvious question : who were these people ?
At the time , I &apos;d barely heard about Calais , but it took about two or three seconds to figure out Calais is basically known for two things .
It &apos;s the spot in continental Europe closest to Britain , and a lot of migrants and refugees are staying in this camp and are trying desperately to cross over to Britain .
And right there was a plausible theory about the identity of the two people , and the police made this theory as well .
Because if you or I or anybody else with a firm connection to Europe goes missing off the coast of France , people would just know .
Your friends or family would report you missing , the police would come search for you , the media would know , and there would be pictures of you on lampposts .
It &apos;s difficult to disappear without a trace .
But if you just fled the war in Syria , and your family , if you have any family left , don &apos;t necessarily know where you are , and you &apos;re staying here illegally amongst thousands of others who come and go every day .
Well , if you disappear one day , nobody will notice .
The police won &apos;t come search for you because nobody knows you &apos;re gone .
And this is what happened to Shadi Omar Kataf and Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria .
Me and Tomm went to Calais for the first time in April this year , and after three months of investigation , we were able to tell the story about how these two young men fled the war in Syria , ended up stuck in Calais , bought wetsuits and drowned in what seems to have been an attempt to swim across the English Channel in order to reach England .
It is a story about the fact that everybody has a name , everybody has a story , everybody is someone .
But it is also a story about what it &apos;s like to be a refugee in Europe today .
So this is where we started our search .
This is in Calais .
Right now , between 3,500 and 5,000 people are living here under horrible conditions .
It has been dubbed the worst refugee camp in Europe .
Limited access to food , limited access to water , limited access to health care .
Disease and infections are widespread .
And they &apos;re all stuck here because they &apos;re trying to get to England in order to claim asylum .
And they do that by hiding in the back of trucks headed for the ferry , or the Eurotunnel , or they sneak inside the tunnel terminal at night to try to hide on the trains .
Most want to go to Britain because they know the language , and so they figure it would be easier to restart their lives from there .
They want to work , they want to study , they want to be able to continue their lives .
A lot of these people are highly educated and skilled workers .
If you go to Calais and talk to refugees , you &apos;ll meet lawyers , politicians , engineers , graphic designers , farmers , soldiers .
You &apos;ve got the whole spectrum .
But who all of these people are usually gets lost in the way we talk about refugees and migrants , because we usually do that in statistics .
So you have 60 million refugees globally .
About half a million have made the crossing over the Mediterranean into Europe so far this year , and roughly 4,000 are staying in Calais .
But these are numbers , and the numbers don &apos;t say anything about who these people are , where they came from , or why they &apos;re here .
And first , I want to tell you about one of them .
This is 22-year-old Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria .
We first heard about him after being in Calais the first time looking for answers to the theory of the two dead bodies .
And after a while , we heard this story about a Syrian man who was living in Bradford in England , and had been desperately searching for his nephew Mouaz for months .
And it turned out the last time anybody had heard anything from Mouaz was October 7 , 2014 .
That was the same date the wetsuits were bought .
So we flew over there and we met the uncle and we did DNA samples of him , and later on got additional DNA samples from Mouaz &apos;s closest relative who now lives in Jordan .
The analysis concluded the body who was found in a wetsuit on a beach in the Netherlands was actually Mouaz Al Balkhi .
And while we were doing all this investigation , we got to know Mouaz &apos;s story .
He was born in the Syrian capital of Damascus in 1991 .
He was raised in a middle class family , and his father in the middle there is a chemical engineer who spent 11 years in prison for belonging to the political opposition in Syria .
While his father was in prison , Mouaz took responsibility and he cared for his three sisters .
They said he was that kind of guy .
Mouaz studied to become an electrical engineer at the University of Damascus .
So a couple of years into the Syrian war , the family fled Damascus and went to the neighboring country , Jordan .
Their father had problems finding work in Jordan , and Mouaz could not continue his studies , so he figured , &quot; &quot; OK , the best thing I can do to help my family would be to go somewhere where I can finish my studies and find work . &quot; &quot; So he goes to Turkey .
In Turkey , he &apos;s not accepted at a university , and once he had left Jordan as a refugee , he was not allowed to reenter .
So then he decides to head for the UK , where his uncle lives .
He makes it into Algeria , walks into Libya , pays a people smuggler to help him with the crossing into Italy by boat , and from there on he heads to Dunkirk , the city right next to Calais by the English Channel .
We know he made at least 12 failed attempts to cross the English Channel by hiding in a truck .
But at some point , he must have given up all hope .
The last night we know he was alive , he spent at a cheap hotel close to the train station in Dunkirk .
We found his name in the records , and he seems to have stayed there alone .
The day after , he went into Calais , entered a sports shop a couple of minutes before 8 o &apos;clock in the evening , along with Shadi Kataf .
They both bought wetsuits , and the woman in the shop was the last person we know of to have seen them alive .
We have tried to figure out where Shadi met Mouaz , but we weren &apos;t able to do that .
But they do have a similar story .
We first heard about Shadi after a cousin of his , living in Germany , had read an Arabic translation of the story made of Mouaz on Facebook .
So we got in touch with him .
Shadi , a couple of years older than Mouaz , was also raised in Damascus .
He was a working kind of guy .
He ran a tire repair shop and later worked in a printing company .
He lived with his extended family , but their house got bombed early in the war .
So the family fled to an area of Damascus known as Camp Yarmouk .
Yarmouk is being described as the worst place to live on planet Earth .
They &apos;ve been bombed by the military , they &apos;ve been besieged , they &apos;ve been stormed by ISIS and they &apos;ve been cut off from supplies for years .
There was a UN official who visited last year , and he said , &quot; &quot; They ate all the grass so there was no grass left . &quot; &quot; Out of a population of 150,000 , only 18,000 are believed to still be left in Yarmouk .
Shadi and his sisters got out .
The parents are still stuck inside .
So Shadi and one of his sisters , they fled to Libya .
This was after the fall of Gaddafi , but before Libya turned into full-blown civil war .
And in this last remaining sort of stability in Libya , Shadi took up scuba diving , and he seemed to spend most of his time underwater .
He fell completely in love with the ocean , so when he finally decided that he could no longer be in Libya , late August 2014 , he hoped to find work as a diver when he reached Italy .
Reality was not that easy .
We don &apos;t know much about his travels because he had a hard time communicating with his family , but we do know that he struggled .
And by the end of September , he was living on the streets somewhere in France .
On October 7 , he calls his cousin in Belgium , and explains his situation .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m in Calais . I need you to come get my backpack and my laptop .
I can &apos;t afford to pay the people smugglers to help me with the crossing to Britain , but I will go buy a wetsuit and I will swim . &quot; &quot; His cousin , of course , tried to warn him not to , but Shadi &apos;s battery on the phone went flat , and his phone was never switched on again .
What was left of Shadi was found nearly three months later , 800 kilometers away in a wetsuit on a beach in Norway .
He &apos;s still waiting for his funeral in Norway , and none of his family will be able to attend .
Many may think that the story about Shadi and Mouaz is a story about death , but I don &apos;t agree .
To me , this is a story about two questions that I think we all share : what is a better life , and what am I willing to do to achieve it ?
And to me , and probably a lot of you , a better life would mean being able to do more of what we think of as meaningful , whether that be spending more time with your family and friends , travel to an exotic place , or just getting money to buy that cool new device or a pair of new sneakers .
And this is all within our reach pretty easily .
But if you are fleeing a war zone , the answers to those two questions are dramatically different .
A better life is a life in safety .
It &apos;s a life in dignity .
A better life means not having your house bombed , not fearing being kidnapped .
It means being able to send your children to school , go to university , or just find work to be able to provide for yourself and the ones you love .
A better life would be a future of some possibilities compared to nearly none , and that &apos;s a strong motivation .
And I have no trouble imagining that after spending weeks or even months as a second-grade citizen , living on the streets or in a horrible makeshift camp with a stupid , racist name like &quot; &quot; The Jungle , &quot; &quot; most of us would be willing to do just about anything .
If I could ask Shadi and Mouaz the second they stepped into the freezing waters of the English Channel , they would probably say , &quot; &quot; This is worth the risk , &quot; &quot; because they could no longer see any other option .
And that &apos;s desperation , but that &apos;s the reality of living as a refugee in Western Europe in 2015 .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Bruno Giussani : Thank you , Anders .
This is Tomm Christiansen , who took most of the pictures you have seen and they &apos;ve done reporting together .
Tomm , you two have been back to Calais recently .
This was the third trip .
It was after the publication of the article .
What has changed ? What have you seen there ?
Tomm Christiansen : The first time we were in Calais , it was about 1,500 refugees there .
They had a difficult time , but they were positive , they had hope .
The last time , the camp has grown , maybe four or five thousand people .
It seemed more permanent , NGOs have arrived , a small school has opened .
But the thing is that the refugees have stayed for a longer time , and the French government has managed to seal off the borders better , so now The Jungle is growing , along with the despair and hopelessness among the refugees .
BG : Are you planning to go back ? And continue the reporting ?
TC : Yes .
BG : Anders , I &apos;m a former journalist , and to me , it &apos;s amazing that in the current climate of slashing budgets and publishers in crisis , Dagbladet has consented so many resources for this story , which tells a lot about newspapers taking the responsibility , but how did you sell it to your editors ?
Anders Fjellberg : It wasn &apos;t easy at first , because we weren &apos;t able to know what we actually could figure out .
As soon as it became clear that we actually could be able to identify who the first one was , we basically got the message that we could do whatever we wanted , just travel wherever you need to go , do whatever you need to do , just get this done .
BG : That &apos;s an editor taking responsibility .
The story , by the way , has been translated and published across several European countries , and certainly will continue to do .
And we want to read the updates from you . Thank you Anders . Thank you Tomm .

Companies are losing control .
What happens on Wall Street no longer stays on Wall Street .
What happens in Vegas ends up on YouTube . ( Laughter ) Reputations are volatile . Loyalties are fickle .
Management teams seem increasingly disconnected from their staff . ( Laughter ) A recent survey said that 27 percent of bosses believe their employees are inspired by their firm .
However , in the same survey , only four percent of employees agreed .
Companies are losing control of their customers and their employees .
But are they really ?
I &apos;m a marketer , and as a marketer , I know that I &apos;ve never really been in control .
Your brand is what other people say about you when you &apos;re not in the room , the saying goes .
Hyperconnectivity and transparency allow companies to be in that room now , 24 / 7 .
They can listen and join the conversation .
In fact , they have more control over the loss of control than ever before .
They can design for it . But how ?
First of all , they can give employees and customers more control .
They can collaborate with them on the creation of ideas , knowledge , content , designs and product .
They can give them more control over pricing , which is what the band Radiohead did with its pay-as-you-like online release of its album &quot; &quot; In Rainbows . &quot; &quot; Buyers could determine the price , but the offer was exclusive , and only stood for a limited period of time .
The album sold more copies than previous releases of the band .
The Danish chocolate company Anthon Berg opened a so-called &quot; &quot; generous store &quot; &quot; in Copenhagen .
It asked customers to purchase chocolate with the promise of good deeds towards loved ones .
It turned transactions into interactions , and generosity into a currency .
Companies can even give control to hackers .
When Microsoft Kinect came out , the motion-controlled add-on to its Xbox gaming console , it immediately drew the attention of hackers .
Microsoft first fought off the hacks , but then shifted course when it realized that actively supporting the community came with benefits .
The sense of co-ownership , the free publicity , the added value , all helped drive sales .
The ultimate empowerment of customers is to ask them not to buy .
Outdoor clothier Patagonia encouraged prospective buyers to check out eBay for its used products and to resole their shoes before purchasing new ones .
In an even more radical stance against consumerism , the company placed a &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t Buy This Jacket &quot; &quot; advertisement during the peak of shopping season .
It may have jeopardized short-term sales , but it builds lasting , long-term loyalty based on shared values .
Research has shown that giving employees more control over their work makes them happier and more productive .
The Brazilian company Semco Group famously lets employees set their own work schedules and even their salaries .
Hulu and Netflix , among other companies , have open vacation policies .
Companies can give people more control , but they can also give them less control .
Traditional business wisdom holds that trust is earned by predictable behavior , but when everything is consistent and standardized , how do you create meaningful experiences ?
Giving people less control might be a wonderful way to counter the abundance of choice and make them happier .
Take the travel service Nextpedition .
Nextpedition turns the trip into a game , with surprising twists and turns along the way .
It does not tell the traveler where she &apos;s going until the very last minute , and information is provided just in time . Similarly , Dutch airline KLM launched a surprise campaign , seemingly randomly handing out small gifts to travelers en route to their destination .
U.K.-based Interflora monitored Twitter for users who were having a bad day , and then sent them a free bouquet of flowers .
Is there anything companies can do to make their employees feel less pressed for time ? Yes .
Force them to help others .
A recent study suggests that having employees complete occasional altruistic tasks throughout the day increases their sense of overall productivity .
At Frog , the company I work for , we hold internal speed meet sessions that connect old and new employees , helping them get to know each other fast .
By applying a strict process , we give them less control , less choice , but we enable more and richer social interactions .
Companies are the makers of their fortunes , and like all of us , they are utterly exposed to serendipity .
That should make them more humble , more vulnerable and more human .
At the end of the day , as hyperconnectivity and transparency expose companies &apos; behavior in broad daylight , staying true to their true selves is the only sustainable value proposition .
Or as the ballet dancer Alonzo King said , &quot; What &apos;s interesting about you is you . &quot;
For the true selves of companies to come through , openness is paramount , but radical openness is not a solution , because when everything is open , nothing is open .
&quot; A smile is a door that is half open and half closed , &quot; the author Jennifer Egan wrote .
Companies can give their employees and customers more control or less . They can worry about how much openness is good for them , and what needs to stay closed .
Or they can simply smile , and remain open to all possibilities .

But on the right , you have the students with the growth mindset , the idea that abilities can be developed .
Are we raising them for now instead of yet ?
How can we build that bridge to yet ?
There are other ways to reward yet .
In this game , students were rewarded for effort , strategy and progress .
So the Native kids outdid the Microsoft kids .
A few months ago the Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to two teams of astronomers for a discovery that has been hailed as one of the most important astronomical observations ever .
And today , after briefly describing what they found , I &apos;m going to tell you about a highly controversial framework for explaining their discovery , namely the possibility that way beyond the Earth , the Milky Way and other distant galaxies , we may find that our universe is not the only universe , but is instead part of a vast complex of universes that we call the multiverse .
Now the idea of a multiverse is a strange one .
I mean , most of us were raised to believe that the word &quot; &quot; universe &quot; &quot; means everything .
And I say most of us with forethought , as my four-year-old daughter has heard me speak of these ideas since she was born .
And last year I was holding her and I said , &quot; &quot; Sophia , I love you more than anything in the universe . &quot; &quot; And she turned to me and said , &quot; &quot; Daddy , universe or multiverse ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But barring such an anomalous upbringing , it is strange to imagine other realms separate from ours , most with fundamentally different features , that would rightly be called universes of their own .
And yet , speculative though the idea surely is , I aim to convince you that there &apos;s reason for taking it seriously , as it just might be right .
I &apos;m going to tell the story of the multiverse in three parts .
In part one , I &apos;m going to describe those Nobel Prize-winning results and to highlight a profound mystery which those results revealed .
In part two , I &apos;ll offer a solution to that mystery .
It &apos;s based on an approach called string theory , and that &apos;s where the idea of the multiverse will come into the story .
Finally , in part three , I &apos;m going to describe a cosmological theory called inflation , which will pull all the pieces of the story together .
Okay , part one starts back in 1929 when the great astronomer Edwin Hubble realized that the distant galaxies were all rushing away from us , establishing that space itself is stretching , it &apos;s expanding .
Now this was revolutionary .
The prevailing wisdom was that on the largest of scales the universe was static .
But even so , there was one thing that everyone was certain of : The expansion must be slowing down .
That , much as the gravitational pull of the Earth slows the ascent of an apple tossed upward , the gravitational pull of each galaxy on every other must be slowing the expansion of space .
Now let &apos;s fast-forward to the 1990s when those two teams of astronomers I mentioned at the outset were inspired by this reasoning to measure the rate at which the expansion has been slowing .
And they did this by painstaking observations of numerous distant galaxies , allowing them to chart how the expansion rate has changed over time .
Here &apos;s the surprise : They found that the expansion is not slowing down .
Instead they found that it &apos;s speeding up , going faster and faster .
That &apos;s like tossing an apple upward and it goes up faster and faster .
Now if you saw an apple do that , you &apos;d want to know why .
What &apos;s pushing on it ?
Similarly , the astronomers &apos; results are surely well-deserving of the Nobel Prize , but they raised an analogous question .
What force is driving all galaxies to rush away from every other at an ever-quickening speed ?
Well the most promising answer comes from an old idea of Einstein &apos;s .
You see , we are all used to gravity being a force that does one thing , pulls objects together .
But in Einstein &apos;s theory of gravity , his general theory of relativity , gravity can also push things apart .
How ? Well according to Einstein &apos;s math , if space is uniformly filled with an invisible energy , sort of like a uniform , invisible mist , then the gravity generated by that mist would be repulsive , repulsive gravity , which is just what we need to explain the observations .
Because the repulsive gravity of an invisible energy in space — we now call it dark energy , but I &apos;ve made it smokey white here so you can see it — its repulsive gravity would cause each galaxy to push against every other , driving expansion to speed up , not slow down .
And this explanation represents great progress .
But I promised you a mystery here in part one .
Here it is .
When the astronomers worked out how much of this dark energy must be infusing space to account for the cosmic speed up , look at what they found .
This number is small .
Expressed in the relevant unit , it is spectacularly small .
And the mystery is to explain this peculiar number .
We want this number to emerge from the laws of physics , but so far no one has found a way to do that .
Now you might wonder , should you care ?
Maybe explaining this number is just a technical issue , a technical detail of interest to experts , but of no relevance to anybody else .
Well it surely is a technical detail , but some details really matter .
Some details provide windows into uncharted realms of reality , and this peculiar number may be doing just that , as the only approach that &apos;s so far made headway to explain it invokes the possibility of other universes — an idea that naturally emerges from string theory , which takes me to part two : string theory .
So hold the mystery of the dark energy in the back of your mind as I now go on to tell you three key things about string theory .
First off , what is it ?
Well it &apos;s an approach to realize Einstein &apos;s dream of a unified theory of physics , a single overarching framework that would be able to describe all the forces at work in the universe .
And the central idea of string theory is quite straightforward .
It says that if you examine any piece of matter ever more finely , at first you &apos;ll find molecules and then you &apos;ll find atoms and subatomic particles .
But the theory says that if you could probe smaller , much smaller than we can with existing technology , you &apos;d find something else inside these particles — a little tiny vibrating filament of energy , a little tiny vibrating string .
And just like the strings on a violin , they can vibrate in different patterns producing different musical notes .
These little fundamental strings , when they vibrate in different patterns , they produce different kinds of particles — so electrons , quarks , neutrinos , photons , all other particles would be united into a single framework , as they would all arise from vibrating strings .
It &apos;s a compelling picture , a kind of cosmic symphony , where all the richness that we see in the world around us emerges from the music that these little , tiny strings can play .
But there &apos;s a cost to this elegant unification , because years of research have shown that the math of string theory doesn &apos;t quite work .
It has internal inconsistencies , unless we allow for something wholly unfamiliar — extra dimensions of space .
That is , we all know about the usual three dimensions of space .
And you can think about those as height , width and depth .
But string theory says that , on fantastically small scales , there are additional dimensions crumpled to a tiny size so small that we have not detected them .
But even though the dimensions are hidden , they would have an impact on things that we can observe because the shape of the extra dimensions constrains how the strings can vibrate .
And in string theory , vibration determines everything .
So particle masses , the strengths of forces , and most importantly , the amount of dark energy would be determined by the shape of the extra dimensions .
So if we knew the shape of the extra dimensions , we should be able to calculate these features , calculate the amount of dark energy .
The challenge is we don &apos;t know the shape of the extra dimensions .
All we have is a list of candidate shapes allowed by the math .
Now when these ideas were first developed , there were only about five different candidate shapes , so you can imagine analyzing them one-by-one to determine if any yield the physical features we observe .
But over time the list grew as researchers found other candidate shapes .
From five , the number grew into the hundreds and then the thousands — A large , but still manageable , collection to analyze , since after all , graduate students need something to do .
But then the list continued to grow into the millions and the billions , until today .
The list of candidate shapes has soared to about 10 to the 500 .
So , what to do ?
Well some researchers lost heart , concluding that was so many candidate shapes for the extra dimensions , each giving rise to different physical features , string theory would never make definitive , testable predictions .
But others turned this issue on its head , taking us to the possibility of a multiverse .
Here &apos;s the idea .
Maybe each of these shapes is on an equal footing with every other .
Each is as real as every other , in the sense that there are many universes , each with a different shape , for the extra dimensions .
And this radical proposal has a profound impact on this mystery : the amount of dark energy revealed by the Nobel Prize-winning results .
Because you see , if there are other universes , and if those universes each have , say , a different shape for the extra dimensions , then the physical features of each universe will be different , and in particular , the amount of dark energy in each universe will be different .
Which means that the mystery of explaining the amount of dark energy we &apos;ve now measured would take on a wholly different character .
In this context , the laws of physics can &apos;t explain one number for the dark energy because there isn &apos;t just one number , there are many numbers .
Which means we have been asking the wrong question .
It &apos;s that the right question to ask is , why do we humans find ourselves in a universe with a particular amount of dark energy we &apos;ve measured instead of any of the other possibilities that are out there ?
And that &apos;s a question on which we can make headway .
Because those universes that have much more dark energy than ours , whenever matter tries to clump into galaxies , the repulsive push of the dark energy is so strong that it blows the clump apart and galaxies don &apos;t form .
And in those universes that have much less dark energy , well they collapse back on themselves so quickly that , again , galaxies don &apos;t form .
And without galaxies , there are no stars , no planets and no chance for our form of life to exist in those other universes .
So we find ourselves in a universe with the particular amount of dark energy we &apos;ve measured simply because our universe has conditions hospitable to our form of life .
And that would be that .
Mystery solved , multiverse found .
Now some find this explanation unsatisfying .
We &apos;re used to physics giving us definitive explanations for the features we observe .
But the point is , if the feature you &apos;re observing can and does take on a wide variety of different values across the wider landscape of reality , then thinking one explanation for a particular value is simply misguided .
An early example comes from the great astronomer Johannes Kepler who was obsessed with understanding a different number — why the Sun is 93 million miles away from the Earth .
And he worked for decades trying to explain this number , but he never succeeded , and we know why .
Kepler was asking the wrong question .
We now know that there are many planets at a wide variety of different distances from their host stars .
So hoping that the laws of physics will explain one particular number , 93 million miles , well that is simply wrongheaded .
Instead the right question to ask is , why do we humans find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance , instead of any of the other possibilities ?
And again , that &apos;s a question we can answer .
Those planets which are much closer to a star like the Sun would be so hot that our form of life wouldn &apos;t exist .
And those planets that are much farther away from the star , well they &apos;re so cold that , again , our form of life would not take hold .
So we find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance simply because it yields conditions vital to our form of life .
And when it comes to planets and their distances , this clearly is the right kind of reasoning .
The point is , when it comes to universes and the dark energy that they contain , it may also be the right kind of reasoning .
One key difference , of course , is we know that there are other planets out there , but so far I &apos;ve only speculated on the possibility that there might be other universes .
So to pull it all together , we need a mechanism that can actually generate other universes .
And that takes me to my final part , part three .
Because such a mechanism has been found by cosmologists trying to understand the Big Bang .
You see , when we speak of the Big Bang , we often have an image of a kind of cosmic explosion that created our universe and set space rushing outward .
But there &apos;s a little secret .
The Big Bang leaves out something pretty important , the Bang .
It tells us how the universe evolved after the Bang , but gives us no insight into what would have powered the Bang itself .
And this gap was finally filled by an enhanced version of the Big Bang theory .
It &apos;s called inflationary cosmology , which identified a particular kind of fuel that would naturally generate an outward rush of space .
The fuel is based on something called a quantum field , but the only detail that matters for us is that this fuel proves to be so efficient that it &apos;s virtually impossible to use it all up , which means in the inflationary theory , the Big Bang giving rise to our universe is likely not a one-time event .
Instead the fuel not only generated our Big Bang , but it would also generate countless other Big Bangs , each giving rise to its own separate universe with our universe becoming but one bubble in a grand cosmic bubble bath of universes .
And now , when we meld this with string theory , here &apos;s the picture we &apos;re led to .
Each of these universes has extra dimensions .
The extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shapes .
The different shapes yield different physical features .
And we find ourselves in one universe instead of another simply because it &apos;s only in our universe that the physical features , like the amount of dark energy , are right for our form of life to take hold .
And this is the compelling but highly controversial picture of the wider cosmos that cutting-edge observation and theory have now led us to seriously consider .
One big remaining question , of course , is , could we ever confirm the existence of other universes ?
Well let me describe one way that might one day happen .
The inflationary theory already has strong observational support .
Because the theory predicts that the Big Bang would have been so intense that as space rapidly expanded , tiny quantum jitters from the micro world would have been stretched out to the macro world , yielding a distinctive fingerprint , a pattern of slightly hotter spots and slightly colder spots , across space , which powerful telescopes have now observed .
Going further , if there are other universes , the theory predicts that every so often those universes can collide .
And if our universe got hit by another , that collision would generate an additional subtle pattern of temperature variations across space that we might one day be able to detect .
And so exotic as this picture is , it may one day be grounded in observations , establishing the existence of other universes .
I &apos;ll conclude with a striking implication of all these ideas for the very far future .
You see , we learned that our universe is not static , that space is expanding , that that expansion is speeding up and that there might be other universes all by carefully examining faint pinpoints of starlight coming to us from distant galaxies .
But because the expansion is speeding up , in the very far future , those galaxies will rush away so far and so fast that we won &apos;t be able to see them — not because of technological limitations , but because of the laws of physics .
The light those galaxies emit , even traveling at the fastest speed , the speed of light , will not be able to overcome the ever-widening gulf between us .
So astronomers in the far future looking out into deep space will see nothing but an endless stretch of static , inky , black stillness .
And they will conclude that the universe is static and unchanging and populated by a single central oasis of matter that they inhabit — a picture of the cosmos that we definitively know to be wrong .
Now maybe those future astronomers will have records handed down from an earlier era , like ours , attesting to an expanding cosmos teeming with galaxies .
But would those future astronomers believe such ancient knowledge ?
Or would they believe in the black , static empty universe that their own state-of-the-art observations reveal ?
I suspect the latter .
Which means that we are living through a remarkably privileged era when certain deep truths about the cosmos are still within reach of the human spirit of exploration .
It appears that it may not always be that way .
Because today &apos;s astronomers , by turning powerful telescopes to the sky , have captured a handful of starkly informative photons — a kind of cosmic telegram billions of years in transit .
and the message echoing across the ages is clear .
Sometimes nature guards her secrets with the unbreakable grip of physical law .
Sometimes the true nature of reality beckons from just beyond the horizon .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : Brian , thank you .
The range of ideas you &apos;ve just spoken about are dizzying , exhilarating , incredible .
How do you think of where cosmology is now , in a sort of historical side ?
Are we in the middle of something unusual historically in your opinion ?
BG : Well it &apos;s hard to say .
When we learn that astronomers of the far future may not have enough information to figure things out , the natural question is , maybe we &apos;re already in that position and certain deep , critical features of the universe already have escaped our ability to understand because of how cosmology evolves .
So from that perspective , maybe we will always be asking questions and never be able to fully answer them .
On the other hand , we now can understand how old the universe is .
We can understand how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation that was set down 13.72 billion years ago — and yet , we can do calculations today to predict how it will look and it matches .
Holy cow ! That &apos;s just amazing .
So on the one hand , it &apos;s just incredible where we &apos;ve gotten , but who knows what sort of blocks we may find in the future .
CA : You &apos;re going to be around for the next few days .
Maybe some of these conversations can continue .
Thank you . Thank you , Brian . ( BG : My pleasure . ) ( Applause )
I &apos;d been thinking about it a lot lately , partly because it &apos;s now exactly 100 years since drugs were first banned in the United States and Britain , and we then imposed that on the rest of the world .
And a few years ago , I was looking at some of the addicts in my life who I love , and trying to figure out if there was some way to help them .
And I realized there were loads of incredibly basic questions I just didn &apos;t know the answer to , like , what really causes addiction ?
Why do we carry on with this approach that doesn &apos;t seem to be working , and is there a better way out there that we could try instead ?
And the thing I realized that really blew my mind is , almost everything we think we know about addiction is wrong , and if we start to absorb the new evidence about addiction , I think we &apos;re going to have to change a lot more than our drug policies .
But let &apos;s start with what we think we know , what I thought I knew .
Let &apos;s think about this middle row here .
Imagine all of you , for 20 days now , went off and used heroin three times a day .
Imagine you did that , right ?
What would happen ?
That &apos;s what I thought .
Diamorphine is heroin .
It &apos;s actually much better heroin than you &apos;re going to buy on the streets , because the stuff you buy from a drug dealer is contaminated .
But here &apos;s the fascinating thing : In Rat Park , they don &apos;t like the drug water .
They almost never use it .
None of them ever use it compulsively .
None of them ever overdose .
You go from almost 100 percent overdose when they &apos;re isolated to zero percent overdose when they have happy and connected lives .
Now , when he first saw this , Professor Alexander thought , maybe this is just a thing about rats , they &apos;re quite different to us .
It was called the Vietnam War .
Now , those soldiers who were using loads of heroin were followed home .
Ninety-five percent of them just stopped .
Now , if you believe the story about chemical hooks , that makes absolutely no sense , but Professor Alexander began to think there might be a different story about addiction .
He said , what if addiction isn &apos;t about your chemical hooks ?
What if addiction is about your cage ?
What if addiction is an adaptation to your environment ?
Human beings have a natural and innate need to bond , and when we &apos;re happy and healthy , we &apos;ll bond and connect with each other , but if you can &apos;t do that , because you &apos;re traumatized or isolated or beaten down by life , you will bond with something that will give you some sense of relief .
That &apos;s what we want as human beings .
And at first , I found this quite a difficult thing to get my head around , but one way that helped me to think about it is , I can see , I &apos;ve got over by my seat a bottle of water , right ?
I &apos;m looking at lots of you , and lots of you have bottles of water with you .
Totally legally , all of those bottles of water could be bottles of vodka , right ?
We could all be getting drunk — I might after this — ( Laughter ) — but we &apos;re not .
You wouldn &apos;t end up homeless .
You &apos;re not going to do that , and the reason you &apos;re not going to do that is not because anyone &apos;s stopping you .
Now , this has really significant implications .
The most obvious implications are for the War on Drugs .
In Arizona , I went out with a group of women who were made to wear t-shirts saying , &quot; &quot; I was a drug addict , &quot; &quot; and go out on chain gangs and dig graves while members of the public jeer at them , and when those women get out of prison , they &apos;re going to have criminal records that mean they &apos;ll never work in the legal economy again .
Now , there &apos;s a place that decided to do the exact opposite , and I went there to see how it worked .
In the year 2000 , Portugal had one of the worst drug problems in Europe .
One percent of the population was addicted to heroin , which is kind of mind-blowing , and every year , they tried the American way more and more .
So they do do residential rehab , they do psychological therapy , that does have some value .
So say you used to be a mechanic .
Overdose is massively down , HIV is massively down among addicts .
Addiction in every study is significantly down .
One of the ways you know it &apos;s worked so well is that almost nobody in Portugal wants to go back to the old system .
Now , that &apos;s the political implications .
I actually think there &apos;s a layer of implications to all this research below that .
We live in a culture where people feel really increasingly vulnerable to all sorts of addictions , whether it &apos;s to their smartphones or to shopping or to eating .
The amount of floor space an individual has in their home has been steadily increasing , and I think that &apos;s like a metaphor for the choice we &apos;ve made as a culture .
And Bruce Alexander , the guy who did the Rat Park experiment , says , we talk all the time in addiction about individual recovery , and it &apos;s right to talk about that , but we need to talk much more about social recovery .
Something &apos;s gone wrong with us , not just with individuals but as a group , and we &apos;ve created a society where , for a lot of us , life looks a whole lot more like that isolated cage and a whole lot less like Rat Park .
If I &apos;m honest , this isn &apos;t why I went into it .
I didn &apos;t go in to the discover the political stuff , the social stuff .
I wanted to know how to help the people I love .
Everyone has a bit of them that looks at an addict and thinks , I wish someone would just stop you .
And I began to think , I began to see why that approach doesn &apos;t work , and I began to think that &apos;s almost like the importing of the logic of the Drug War into our private lives .
So I was thinking , how could I be Portuguese ?
And what I &apos;ve tried to do now , and I can &apos;t tell you I do it consistently and I can &apos;t tell you it &apos;s easy , is to say to the addicts in my life that I want to deepen the connection with them , to say to them , I love you whether you &apos;re using or you &apos;re not .
I love you , whatever state you &apos;re in , and if you need me , I &apos;ll come and sit with you because I love you and I don &apos;t want you to be alone or to feel alone .
And I think the core of that message — you &apos;re not alone , we love you — has to be at every level of how we respond to addicts , socially , politically and individually .
For 100 years now , we &apos;ve been singing war songs about addicts .
I think all along we should have been singing love songs to them , because the opposite of addiction is not sobriety .
The opposite of addiction is connection .
Thank you .

Good morning everybody .
I work with really amazing , little , itty-bitty creatures called cells .
And let me tell you what it &apos;s like to grow these cells in the lab .
I work in a lab where we take cells out of their native environment .
We plate them into dishes that we sometimes call petri dishes .
And we feed them — sterilely of course — with what we call cell culture media — which is like their food — and we grow them in incubators .
Why do I do this ?
We observe the cells in a plate , and they &apos;re just on the surface .
But what we &apos;re really trying to do in my lab is to engineer tissues out of them .
What does that even mean ?
Well it means growing an actual heart , let &apos;s say , or grow a piece of bone that can be put into the body .
Not only that , but they can also be used for disease models .
And for this purpose , traditional cell culture techniques just really aren &apos;t enough .
The cells are kind of homesick ; the dish doesn &apos;t feel like their home .
And so we need to do better at copying their natural environment to get them to thrive .
We call this the biomimetic paradigm — copying nature in the lab .
Let &apos;s take the example of the heart , the topic of a lot of my research .
What makes the heart unique ?
Well , the heart beats , rhythmically , tirelessly , faithfully .
We copy this in the lab by outfitting cell culture systems with electrodes .
These electrodes act like mini pacemakers to get the cells to contract in the lab .
What else do we know about the heart ?
Well , heart cells are pretty greedy .
Nature feeds the heart cells in your body with a very , very dense blood supply .
In the lab , we micro-pattern channels in the biomaterials on which we grow the cells , and this allows us to flow the cell culture media , the cells &apos; food , through the scaffolds where we &apos;re growing the cells — a lot like what you might expect from a capillary bed in the heart .
So this brings me to lesson number one : life can do a lot with very little .
Let &apos;s take the example of electrical stimulation .
Let &apos;s see how powerful just one of these essentials can be .
On the left , we see a tiny piece of beating heart tissue that I engineered from rat cells in the lab .
It &apos;s about the size of a mini marshmallow .
And after one week , it &apos;s beating .
You can see it in the upper left-hand corner .
But don &apos;t worry if you can &apos;t see it so well .
It &apos;s amazing that these cells beat at all .
But what &apos;s really amazing is that the cells , when we electrically stimulate them , like with a pacemaker , that they beat so much more .
But that brings me to lesson number two : cells do all the work .
In a sense , tissue engineers have a bit of an identity crisis here , because structural engineers build bridges and big things , computer engineers , computers , but what we are doing is actually building enabling technologies for the cells themselves .
What does this mean for us ?
Let &apos;s do something really simple .
Let &apos;s remind ourselves that cells are not an abstract concept .
Let &apos;s remember that our cells sustain our lives in a very real way .
&quot; &quot; We are what we eat , &quot; &quot; could easily be described as , &quot; &quot; We are what our cells eat . &quot; &quot; And in the case of the flora in our gut , these cells may not even be human .
But it &apos;s also worth noting that cells also mediate our experience of life .
Behind every sound , sight , touch , taste and smell is a corresponding set of cells that receive this information and interpret it for us .
It begs the question : shall we expand our sense of environmental stewardship to include the ecosystem of our own bodies ?
I invite you to talk about this with me further , and in the meantime , I wish you luck .
May none of your non-cancer cells become endangered species .
Thank you .

My name is Joshua Walters .
I &apos;m a performer .
( Beatboxing ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But as far as being a performer , I &apos;m also diagnosed bipolar .
I reframe that as a positive because the crazier I get onstage , the more entertaining I become .
When I was 16 in San Francisco , I had my breakthrough manic episode in which I thought I was Jesus Christ .
Maybe you thought that was scary , but actually there &apos;s no amount of drugs you can take that can get you as high as if you think you &apos;re Jesus Christ .
( Laughter ) I was sent to a place , a psych ward , and in the psych ward , everyone is doing their own one-man show . ( Laughter )
There &apos;s no audience like this to justify their rehearsal time .
They &apos;re just practicing .
One day they &apos;ll get here .
Now when I got out , I was diagnosed and I was given medications by a psychiatrist .
&quot; &quot; Okay , Josh , why don &apos;t we give you some — why don &apos;t we give you some Zyprexa .
Okay ? Mmhmm ?
At least that &apos;s what it says on my pen . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Some of you are in the field , I can see .
I can feel your noise .
The first half of high school was the struggle of the manic episode , and the second half was the overmedications of these drugs , where I was sleeping through high school .
The second half was just one big nap , pretty much , in class .
When I got out I had a choice .
I could either deny my mental illness or embrace my mental skillness .
( Bugle sound ) There &apos;s a movement going on right now to reframe mental illness as a positive — at least the hypomanic edge part of it .
Now if you don &apos;t know what hypomania is , it &apos;s like an engine that &apos;s out of control , maybe a Ferrari engine , with no breaks .
Many of the speakers here , many of you in the audience , have that creative edge , if you know what I &apos;m talking about .
You &apos;re driven to do something that everyone has told you is impossible .
And there &apos;s a book — John Gartner .
John Gartner wrote this book called &quot; &quot; The Hypomanic Edge &quot; &quot; in which Christopher Columbus and Ted Turner and Steve Jobs and all these business minds have this edge to compete .
A different book was written not too long ago in the mid-90s called &quot; &quot; Touched With Fire &quot; &quot; by Kay Redfield Jamison in which it was looked at in a creative sense in which Mozart and Beethoven and Van Gogh all have this manic depression that they were suffering with .
Some of them committed suicide .
So it wasn &apos;t all the good side of the illness .
Now recently , there &apos;s been development in this field .
And there was an article written in the New York Times , September 2010 , that stated : &quot; Just Manic Enough . &quot;
Just be manic enough in which investors who are looking for entrepreneurs that have this kind of spectrum — you know what I &apos;m talking about — not maybe full bipolar , but they &apos;re in the bipolar spectrum — where on one side , maybe you think you &apos;re Jesus , and on the other side maybe they just make you a lot of money .
( Laughter ) Your call . Your call .
And everyone &apos;s somewhere in the middle .
Everyone &apos;s somewhere in the middle .
So maybe , you know , there &apos;s no such thing as crazy , and being diagnosed with a mental illness doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re crazy .
But maybe it just means you &apos;re more sensitive to what most people can &apos;t see or feel .
Maybe no one &apos;s really crazy .
Everyone is just a little bit mad .
How much depends on where you fall in the spectrum . How much
depends on how lucky you are .
Thank you .

At every stage of our lives we make decisions that will profoundly influence the lives of the people we &apos;re going to become , and then when we become those people , we &apos;re not always thrilled with the decisions we made .
So young people pay good money to get tattoos removed that teenagers paid good money to get .
Middle-aged people rushed to divorce people who young adults rushed to marry .
Older adults work hard to lose what middle-aged adults worked hard to gain .
On and on and on .
The question is , as a psychologist , that fascinates me is , why do we make decisions that our future selves so often regret ?
Now , I think one of the reasons — I &apos;ll try to convince you today — is that we have a fundamental misconception about the power of time .
Every one of you knows that the rate of change slows over the human lifespan , that your children seem to change by the minute but your parents seem to change by the year .
But what is the name of this magical point in life where change suddenly goes from a gallop to a crawl ?
Is it teenage years ? Is it middle age ?
Is it old age ? The answer , it turns out , for most people , is now , wherever now happens to be .
What I want to convince you today is that all of us are walking around with an illusion , an illusion that history , our personal history , has just come to an end , that we have just recently become the people that we were always meant to be and will be for the rest of our lives .
Let me give you some data to back up that claim .
So here &apos;s a study of change in people &apos;s personal values over time .
Here &apos;s three values .
Everybody here holds all of them , but you probably know that as you grow , as you age , the balance of these values shifts .
So how does it do so ?
Well , we asked thousands of people .
We asked half of them to predict for us how much their values would change in the next 10 years , and the others to tell us how much their values had changed in the last 10 years .
And this enabled us to do a really interesting kind of analysis , because it allowed us to compare the predictions of people , say , 18 years old , to the reports of people who were 28 , and to do that kind of analysis throughout the lifespan .
Here &apos;s what we found .
First of all , you are right , change does slow down as we age , but second , you &apos;re wrong , because it doesn &apos;t slow nearly as much as we think .
At every age , from 18 to 68 in our data set , people vastly underestimated how much change they would experience over the next 10 years .
We call this the &quot; &quot; end of history &quot; &quot; illusion .
To give you an idea of the magnitude of this effect , you can connect these two lines , and what you see here is that 18-year-olds anticipate changing only as much as 50-year-olds actually do .
Now it &apos;s not just values . It &apos;s all sorts of other things .
For example , personality .
Many of you know that psychologists now claim that there are five fundamental dimensions of personality : neuroticism , openness to experience , agreeableness , extraversion , and conscientiousness .
Again , we asked people how much they expected to change over the next 10 years , and also how much they had changed over the last 10 years , and what we found , well , you &apos;re going to get used to seeing this diagram over and over , because once again the rate of change does slow as we age , but at every age , people underestimate how much their personalities will change in the next decade .
And it isn &apos;t just ephemeral things like values and personality .
You can ask people about their likes and dislikes , their basic preferences .
For example , name your best friend , your favorite kind of vacation , what &apos;s your favorite hobby , what &apos;s your favorite kind of music .
People can name these things .
We ask half of them to tell us , &quot; Do you think that that will change over the next 10 years ? &quot;
and half of them to tell us , &quot; Did that change over the last 10 years ? &quot;
And what we find , well , you &apos;ve seen it twice now , and here it is again : people predict that the friend they have now is the friend they &apos;ll have in 10 years , the vacation they most enjoy now is the one they &apos;ll enjoy in 10 years , and yet , people who are 10 years older all say , &quot; Eh , you know , that &apos;s really changed . &quot;
Does any of this matter ?
Is this just a form of mis-prediction that doesn &apos;t have consequences ?
No , it matters quite a bit , and I &apos;ll give you an example of why .
It bedevils our decision-making in important ways .
Bring to mind right now for yourself your favorite musician today and your favorite musician 10 years ago .
I put mine up on the screen to help you along .
Now we asked people to predict for us , to tell us how much money they would pay right now to see their current favorite musician perform in concert 10 years from now , and on average , people said they would pay 129 dollars for that ticket .
And yet , when we asked them how much they would pay to see the person who was their favorite 10 years ago perform today , they say only 80 dollars .
Now , in a perfectly rational world , these should be the same number , but we overpay for the opportunity to indulge our current preferences because we overestimate their stability .
Why does this happen ? We &apos;re not entirely sure , but it probably has to do with the ease of remembering versus the difficulty of imagining .
Most of us can remember who we were 10 years ago , but we find it hard to imagine who we &apos;re going to be , and then we mistakenly think that because it &apos;s hard to imagine , it &apos;s not likely to happen .
Sorry , when people say &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; they &apos;re usually talking about their own lack of imagination , and not about the unlikelihood of the event that they &apos;re describing .
The bottom line is , time is a powerful force .
It transforms our preferences .
It reshapes our values .
It alters our personalities .
We seem to appreciate this fact , but only in retrospect .
Only when we look backwards do we realize how much change happens in a decade .
It &apos;s as if , for most of us , the present is a magic time .
It &apos;s a watershed on the timeline .
It &apos;s the moment at which we finally become ourselves .
Human beings are works in progress that mistakenly think they &apos;re finished .
The person you are right now is as transient , as fleeting and as temporary as all the people you &apos;ve ever been .
The one constant in our life is change .
Thank you .

About four years ago , the New Yorker published an article about a cache of dodo bones that was found in a pit on the island of Mauritius .
Now , the island of Mauritius is a small island off the east coast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean , and it is the place where the dodo bird was discovered and extinguished , all within about 150 years .
Everyone was very excited about this archaeological find , because it meant that they might finally be able to assemble a single dodo skeleton .
See , while museums all over the world have dodo skeletons in their collection , nobody — not even the actual Natural History Museum on the island of Mauritius — has a skeleton that &apos;s made from the bones of a single dodo .
Well , this isn &apos;t exactly true .
The fact is , is that the British Museum had a complete specimen of a dodo in their collection up until the 18th century — it was actually mummified , skin and all — but in a fit of space-saving zeal , they actually cut off the head and they cut off the feet and they burned the rest in a bonfire .
If you go look at their website today , they &apos;ll actually list these specimens , saying , the rest was lost in a fire .
Not quite the whole truth . Anyway .
The frontispiece of this article was this photo , and I &apos;m one of the people that thinks that Tina Brown was great for bringing photos to the New Yorker , because this photo completely rocked my world .
I became obsessed with the object — not just the beautiful photograph itself , and the color , the shallow depth of field , the detail that &apos;s visible , the wire you can see on the beak there that the conservator used to put this skeleton together — there &apos;s an entire story here .
And I thought to myself , wouldn &apos;t it be great if I had my own dodo skeleton ?
( Laughter ) I want to point out here at this point that I &apos;ve spent my life obsessed by objects and the stories that they tell , and this was the very latest one .
So I began looking around for — to see if anyone sold a kit , some kind of model that I could get , and I found lots of reference material , lots of lovely pictures .
No dice : no dodo skeleton for me . But the damage had been done .
I had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletons into my &quot; &quot; Creative Projects &quot; &quot; folder — it &apos;s a repository for my brain , everything that I could possibly be interested in .
Any time I have an internet connection , there &apos;s a sluice of stuff moving into there , everything from beautiful rings to cockpit photos .
The key that the Marquis du Lafayette sent to George Washington to celebrate the storming of the Bastille .
Russian nuclear launch key : The one on the top is the picture of the one I found on eBay ; the one on the bottom is the one I made for myself , because I couldn &apos;t afford the one on eBay .
Storm trooper costumes . Maps of Middle Earth — that &apos;s one I hand-drew myself . There &apos;s the dodo skeleton folder .
This folder has 17,000 photos — over 20 gigabytes of information — and it &apos;s growing constantly .
And one day , a couple of weeks later , it might have been maybe a year later , I was in the art store with my kids , and I was buying some clay tools — we were going to have a craft day .
I bought some Super Sculpeys , some armature wire , some various materials .
And I looked down at this Sculpey , and I thought , maybe , yeah , maybe I could make my own dodo skull .
I should point out at this time — I &apos;m not a sculptor ; I &apos;m a hard-edged model maker .
You give me a drawing , you give me a prop to replicate , you give me a crane , scaffolding , parts from &quot; &quot; Star Wars &quot; &quot; — especially parts from &quot; &quot; Star Wars &quot; &quot; — I can do this stuff all day long .
It &apos;s exactly how I made my living for 15 years .
But you give me something like this — my friend Mike Murnane sculpted this ; it &apos;s a maquette for &quot; &quot; Star Wars , Episode Two &quot; &quot; — this is not my thing — this is something other people do — dragons , soft things .
However , I felt like I had looked at enough photos of dodo skulls to actually be able to understand the topology and perhaps replicate it — I mean , it couldn &apos;t be that difficult .
So , I started looking at the best photos I could find .
I grabbed all the reference , and I found this lovely piece of reference .
This is someone selling this on eBay ; it was clearly a woman ’ s hand , hopefully a woman &apos;s hand .
Assuming it was roughly the size of my wife &apos;s hand , I made some measurements of her thumb , and I scaled them out to the size of the skull .
I blew it up to the actual size , and I began using that , along with all the other reference that I had , comparing it to it as size reference for figuring out exactly how big the beak should be , exactly how long , etc .
And over a few hours , I eventually achieved what was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull . And I didn &apos;t mean to continue , I — it &apos;s kind of like , you know , you can only clean a super messy room by picking up one thing at a time ; you can &apos;t think about the totality .
I wasn &apos;t thinking about a dodo skeleton ; I just noticed that as I finished this skull , the armature wire that I had been used to holding it up was sticking out of the back just where a spine would be .
And one of the other things I &apos;d been interested in and obsessed with over the years is spines and skeletons , having collected a couple of hundred .
I actually understood the mechanics of vertebrae enough to kind of start to imitate them .
And so button by button , vertebrae by vertebrae , I built my way down .
And actually , by the end of the day , I had a reasonable skull , a moderately good vertebrae and half of a pelvis .
And again , I kept on going , looking for more reference , every bit of reference I could find — drawings , beautiful photos .
This guy — I love this guy ! He put a dodo leg bones on a scanner with a ruler .
This is the kind of accuracy that I wanted , and I replicated every last bone and put it in .
And after about six weeks , I finished , painted , mounted my own dodo skeleton .
You can see that I even made a museum label for it that includes a brief history of the dodo .
And TAP Plastics made me — although I didn &apos;t photograph it — a museum vitrine .
I don &apos;t have the room for this in my house , but I had to finish what I had started .
And this actually represented kind of a sea change to me .
Again , like I said , my life has been about being fascinated by objects and the stories that they tell , and also making them for myself , obtaining them , appreciating them and diving into them .
And in this folder , &quot; &quot; Creative Projects , &quot; &quot; there are tons of projects that I &apos;m currently working on , projects that I &apos;ve already worked on , things that I might want to work on some day , and things that I may just want to find and buy and have and look at and touch .
But now there was potentially this new category of things that I could sculpt that was different , that I — you know , I have my own R2D2 , but that &apos;s — honestly , relative to sculpting , to me , that &apos;s easy .
And so I went back and looked through my &quot; &quot; Creative Projects &quot; &quot; folder , and I happened across the Maltese Falcon .
Now , this is funny for me : to fall in love with an object from a Hammett novel , because if it &apos;s true that the world is divided into two types of people , Chandler people and Hammett people , I am absolutely a Chandler person .
But in this case , it &apos;s not about the author , it &apos;s not about the book or the movie or the story , it &apos;s about the object in and of itself .
And in this case , this object is — plays on a host of levels .
First of all , there &apos;s the object in the world .
This is the &quot; &quot; Kniphausen Hawk . &quot; &quot; It is a ceremonial pouring vessel made around 1700 for a Swedish Count , and it is very likely the object from which Hammett drew his inspiration for the Maltese Falcon .
Then there is the fictional bird , the one that Hammett created for the book .
Built out of words , it is the engine that drives the plot of his book and also the movie , in which another object is created : a prop that has to represent the thing that Hammett created out of words , inspired by the Kniphausen Hawk , and this represents the falcon in the movie .
And then there is this fourth level , which is a whole new object in the world : the prop made for the movie , the representative of the thing , becomes , in its own right , a whole other thing , a whole new object of desire .
And so now it was time to do some research .
I actually had done some research a few years before — it &apos;s why the folder was there .
I &apos;d bought a replica , a really crappy replica , of the Maltese Falcon on eBay , and had downloaded enough pictures to actually have some reasonable reference .
But I discovered , in researching further , really wanting precise reference , that one of the original lead birds had been sold at Christie &apos;s in 1994 , and so I contacted an antiquarian bookseller who had the original Christie &apos;s catalogue , and in it I found this magnificent picture , which included a size reference .
I was able to scan the picture , blow it up to exactly full size .
I found other reference . Avi &#91; Ara &#93; Chekmayan , a New Jersey editor , actually found this resin Maltese Falcon at a flea market in 1991 , although it took him five years to authenticate this bird to the auctioneers &apos; specifications , because there was a lot of controversy about it .
It was made out of resin , which wasn &apos;t a common material for movie props about the time the movie was made .
It &apos;s funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it , because I can see it compared to this thing , and I can tell you — it &apos;s real , it &apos;s the real thing , it &apos;s made from the exact same mold that this one is .
In this one , because the auction was actually so controversial , Profiles in History , the auction house that sold this — I think in 1995 for about 100,000 dollars — they actually included — you can see here on the bottom — not just a front elevation , but also a side , rear and other side elevation .
So now , I had all the topology I needed to replicate the Maltese Falcon .
What do they do , how do you start something like that ? I really don &apos;t know .
So what I did was , again , like I did with the dodo skull , I blew all my reference up to full size , and then I began cutting out the negatives and using those templates as shape references .
So I took Sculpey , and I built a big block of it , and I passed it through until , you know , I got the right profiles .
And then slowly , feather by feather , detail by detail , I worked out and achieved — working in front of the television and Super Sculpey — here &apos;s me sitting next to my wife — it &apos;s the only picture I took of the entire process .
As I moved through , I achieved a very reasonable facsimile of the Maltese Falcon .
But again , I am not a sculptor , and so I don &apos;t know a lot of the tricks , like , I don &apos;t know how my friend Mike gets beautiful , shiny surfaces with his Sculpey ; I certainly wasn &apos;t able to get it .
So , I went down to my shop , and I molded it and I cast it in resin , because in the resin , then , I could absolutely get the glass smooth finished .
Now there &apos;s a lot of ways to fill and get yourself a nice smooth finish .
My preference is about 70 coats of this — matte black auto primer .
I spray it on for about three or four days , it drips to hell , but it allows me a really , really nice gentle sanding surface and I can get it glass-smooth .
Oh , finishing up with triple-zero steel wool .
Now , the great thing about getting it to this point was that because in the movie , when they finally bring out the bird at the end , and they place it on the table , they actually spin it .
So I was able to actually screen-shot and freeze-frame to make sure .
And I &apos;m following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as I &apos;m holding the light in the same position , I &apos;m getting the same type of reflection on it — that &apos;s the level of detail I &apos;m going into this thing .
I ended up with this : my Maltese Falcon .
And it &apos;s beautiful . And I can state with authority at this point in time , when I &apos;d finished it , of all of the replicas out there — and there is a few — this is by far the most accurate representation of the original Maltese Falcon than anyone has sculpted . Now the original one , I should tell you , is sculpted by a guy named Fred Sexton .
This is where it gets weird .
Fred Sexton was a friend of this guy , George Hodel .
Terrifying guy — agreed by many to be the killer of the Black Dahlia .
Now , James Ellroy believes that Fred Sexton , the sculptor of the Maltese Falcon , killed James Elroy &apos;s mother .
I &apos;ll go you one stranger than that : In 1974 , during the production of a weird comedy sequel to &quot; &quot; The Maltese Falcon , &quot; &quot; called &quot; &quot; The Black Bird , &quot; &quot; starring George Segal , the Los Angeles County Museum of Art had a plaster original of the Maltese Falcon — one of the original six plasters , I think , made for the movie — stolen out of the museum . A lot of people thought it was a publicity stunt for the movie .
John &apos;s Grill , which actually is seen briefly in &quot; &quot; The Maltese Falcon , &quot; &quot; is still a viable San Francisco eatery , counted amongst its regular customers Elisha Cook , who played Wilmer Cook in the movie , and he gave them one of his original plasters of the Maltese Falcon .
And they had it in their cabinet for about 15 years , until it got stolen in January of 2007 .
It would seem that the object of desire only comes into its own by disappearing repeatedly .
So here I had this Falcon , and it was lovely . It looked really great , the light worked on it really well , it was better than anything that I could achieve or obtain out in the world .
But there was a problem . And the problem was that : I wanted the entirety of the object , I wanted the weight behind the object .
This thing was made of resin and it was too light .
There &apos;s this group online that I frequent .
It &apos;s a group of prop crazies just like me called the Replica Props Forum , and it &apos;s people who trade , make and travel in information about movie props .
And it turned out that one of the guys there , a friend of mine that I never actually met , but befriended through some prop deals , was the manager of a local foundry .
He took my master Falcon pattern , he actually did lost wax casting in bronze for me , and this is the bronze I got back .
And this is , after some acid etching , the one that I ended up with .
And this thing , it &apos;s deeply , deeply satisfying to me .
Here , I &apos;m going to put it out there , later on tonight , and I want you to pick it up and handle it .
You want to know how obsessed I am . This project &apos;s only for me , and yet I went so far as to buy on eBay a 1941 Chinese San Francisco-based newspaper , in order so that the bird could properly be wrapped ...
like it is in the movie .
( Laughter ) Yeah , I know !
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) There you can see , it &apos;s weighing in at 27 and a half pounds .
That &apos;s half the weight of my dog , Huxley .
But there &apos;s a problem .
Now , here &apos;s the most recent progression of Falcons .
On the far left is a piece of crap — a replica I bought on eBay .
There &apos;s my somewhat ruined Sculpey Falcon , because I had to get it back out of the mold . There &apos;s my first casting , there &apos;s my master and there &apos;s my bronze .
There &apos;s a thing that happens when you mold and cast things , which is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin , you lose a little bit of volume , you lose a little bit of size .
And when I held my bronze one up against my Sculpey one , it was shorter by three-quarters of an inch .
Yeah , no , really , this was like aah — why didn &apos;t I remember this ?
Why didn &apos;t I start and make it bigger ?
So what do I do ? I figure I have two options .
One , I can fire a freaking laser at it , which I have already done , to do a 3D scan — there &apos;s a 3D scan of this Falcon .
I had figured out the exact amount of shrinkage I achieved going from a wax master to a bronze master and blown this up big enough to make a 3D lithography master of this , which I will polish , then I will send to the mold maker and then I will have it done in bronze . Or : There are several people who own originals , and I have been attempting to contact them and reach them , hoping that they will let me spend a few minutes in the presence of one of the real birds , maybe to take a picture , or even to pull out the hand-held laser scanner
that I happen to own that fits inside a cereal box , and could maybe , without even touching their bird , I swear , get a perfect 3D scan . And I &apos;m even willing to sign pages saying that I &apos;ll never let anyone else have it , except for me in my office , I promise .
I &apos;ll give them one if they want it .
And then , maybe , then I &apos;ll achieve the end of this exercise .
But really , if we &apos;re all going to be honest with ourselves , I have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise was never the point of the exercise to begin with , was it .
Thank you .
I love a challenge , and saving the Earth is probably a good one .
We all know the Earth is in trouble .
We have now entered in the 6X , the sixth major extinction on this planet .
I often wondered , if there was a United Organization of Organisms — otherwise known as &quot; &quot; Uh-Oh &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — and every organism had a right to vote , would we be voted on the planet , or off the planet ?
I think that vote is occurring right now .
I want to present to you a suite of six mycological solutions , using fungi , and these solutions are based on mycelium .
The mycelium infuses all landscapes , it holds soils together , it &apos;s extremely tenacious .
This holds up to 30,000 times its mass .
They &apos;re the grand molecular disassemblers of nature — the soil magicians .
They generate the humus soils across the landmasses of Earth .
We have now discovered that there is a multi-directional transfer of nutrients between plants , mitigated by the mcyelium — so the mycelium is the mother that is giving nutrients from alder and birch trees to hemlocks , cedars and Douglas firs .
Dusty and I , we like to say , on Sunday , this is where we go to church .
I &apos;m in love with the old-growth forest , and I &apos;m a patriotic American because we have those .
Most of you are familiar with Portobello mushrooms .
And frankly , I face a big obstacle .
When I mention mushrooms to somebody , they immediately think Portobellos or magic mushrooms , their eyes glaze over , and they think I &apos;m a little crazy .
So , I hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group .
We call it mycophobia , the irrational fear of the unknown , when it comes to fungi .
Mushrooms are very fast in their growth .
Day 21 , day 23 , day 25 .
Mushrooms produce strong antibiotics .
In fact , we &apos;re more closely related to fungi than we are to any other kingdom .
A group of 20 eukaryotic microbiologists published a paper two years ago erecting opisthokonta — a super-kingdom that joins animalia and fungi together .
We share in common the same pathogens .
Fungi don &apos;t like to rot from bacteria , and so our best antibiotics come from fungi .
But here is a mushroom that &apos;s past its prime .
After they sporulate , they do rot .
But I propose to you that the sequence of microbes that occur on rotting mushrooms are essential for the health of the forest .
They give rise to the trees , they create the debris fields that feed the mycelium .
And so we see a mushroom here sporulating .
And the spores are germinating , and the mycelium forms and goes underground .
In a single cubic inch of soil , there can be more than eight miles of these cells .
My foot is covering approximately 300 miles of mycelium .
This is photomicrographs from Nick Read and Patrick Hickey .
And notice that as the mycelium grows , it conquers territory and then it begins the net .
I &apos;ve been a scanning electron microscopist for many years , I have thousands of electron micrographs , and when I &apos;m staring at the mycelium , I realize that they are microfiltration membranes .
We exhale carbon dioxide , so does mycelium .
It inhales oxygen , just like we do .
But these are essentially externalized stomachs and lungs .
And I present to you a concept that these are extended neurological membranes .
And in these cavities , these micro-cavities form , and as they fuse soils , they absorb water .
These are little wells .
And inside these wells , then microbial communities begin to form .
And so the spongy soil not only resists erosion , but sets up a microbial universe that gives rise to a plurality of other organisms .
I first proposed , in the early 1990s , that mycelium is Earth &apos;s natural Internet .
When you look at the mycelium , they &apos;re highly branched .
And if there &apos;s one branch that is broken , then very quickly , because of the nodes of crossing — Internet engineers maybe call them hot points — there are alternative pathways for channeling nutrients and information .
The mycelium is sentient .
It knows that you are there .
When you walk across landscapes , it leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab debris .
So , I believe the invention of the computer Internet is an inevitable consequence of a previously proven , biologically successful model .
The Earth invented the computer Internet for its own benefit , and we now , being the top organism on this planet , are trying to allocate resources in order to protect the biosphere .
Going way out , dark matter conforms to the same mycelial archetype .
I believe matter begets life ; life becomes single cells ; single cells become strings ; strings become chains ; chains network .
And this is the paradigm that we see throughout the universe .
Most of you may not know that fungi were the first organisms to come to land .
They came to land 1.3 billion years ago , and plants followed several hundred million years later .
How is that possible ?
It &apos;s possible because the mycelium produces oxalic acids , and many other acids and enzymes , pockmarking rock and grabbing calcium and other minerals and forming calcium oxalates .
Makes the rocks crumble , and the first step in the generation of soil .
Oxalic acid is two carbon dioxide molecules joined together .
So , fungi and mycelium sequester carbon dioxide in the form of calcium oxalates .
And all sorts of other oxalates are also sequestering carbon dioxide through the minerals that are being formed and taken out of the rock matrix .
This was first discovered in 1859 .
This is a photograph by Franz Hueber .
This photograph &apos;s taken 1950s in Saudi Arabia .
420 million years ago , this organism existed .
It was called Prototaxites .
Prototaxites , laying down , was about three feet tall .
The tallest plants on Earth at that time were less than two feet .
Dr. Boyce , at the University of Chicago , published an article in the Journal of Geology this past year determining that Prototaxites was a giant fungus , a giant mushroom .
Across the landscapes of Earth were dotted these giant mushrooms .
All across most land masses .
And these existed for tens of millions of years .
Now , we &apos;ve had several extinction events , and as we march forward — 65 million years ago — most of you know about it — we had an asteroid impact .
The Earth was struck by an asteroid , a huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere .
Sunlight was cut off , and fungi inherited the Earth .
Those organisms that paired with fungi were rewarded , because fungi do not need light .
More recently , at Einstein University , they just determined that fungi use radiation as a source of energy , much like plants use light .
So , the prospect of fungi existing on other planets elsewhere , I think , is a forgone conclusion , at least in my own mind .
The largest organism in the world is in Eastern Oregon .
I couldn &apos;t miss it . It was 2,200 acres in size : 2,200 acres in size , 2,000 years old .
The largest organism on the planet is a mycelial mat , one cell wall thick .
How is it that this organism can be so large , and yet be one cell wall thick , whereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us ?
The mycelium , in the right conditions , produces a mushroom — it bursts through with such ferocity that it can break asphalt .
We were involved with several experiments .
I &apos;m going to show you six , if I can , solutions for helping to save the world .
Battelle Laboratories and I joined up in Bellingham , Washington .
There were four piles saturated with diesel and other petroleum waste : one was a control pile ; one pile was treated with enzymes ; one pile was treated with bacteria ; and our pile we inoculated with mushroom mycelium .
The mycelium absorbs the oil .
The mycelium is producing enzymes — peroxidases — that break carbon-hydrogen bonds .
These are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together .
So , the mycelium becomes saturated with the oil , and then , when we returned six weeks later , all the tarps were removed , all the other piles were dead , dark and stinky .
We came back to our pile , it was covered with hundreds of pounds of oyster mushrooms , and the color changed to a light form .
The enzymes remanufactured the hydrocarbons into carbohydrates — fungal sugars .
Some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms .
They &apos;re very large .
They &apos;re showing how much nutrition that they could &apos;ve obtained .
But something else happened , which was an epiphany in my life .
They sporulated , the spores attract insects , the insects laid eggs , eggs became larvae .
Birds then came , bringing in seeds , and our pile became an oasis of life .
Whereas the other three piles were dead , dark and stinky , and the PAH &apos;s — the aromatic hydrocarbons — went from 10,000 parts per million to less than 200 in eight weeks .
The last image we don &apos;t have .
The entire pile was a green berm of life .
These are gateway species , vanguard species that open the door for other biological communities .
So I invented burlap sacks , bunker spawn — and putting the mycelium — using storm blown debris , you can take these burlap sacks and put them downstream from a farm that &apos;s producing E. coli , or other wastes , or a factory with chemical toxins , and it leads to habitat restoration .
So , we set up a site in Mason County , Washington , and we &apos;ve seen a dramatic decrease in the amount of coliforms .
And I &apos;ll show you a graph here .
This is a logarithmic scale , 10 to the eighth power .
There &apos;s more than a 100 million colonies per gram , and 10 to the third power is around 1,000 .
In 48 hours to 72 hours , these three mushroom species reduced the amount of coliform bacteria 10,000 times .
Think of the implications .
This is a space-conservative method that uses storm debris — and we can guarantee that we will have storms every year .
So , this one mushroom , in particular , has drawn our interest over time .
This is my wife Dusty , with a mushroom called Fomitopsis officinalis — Agarikon .
It &apos;s a mushroom exclusive to the old-growth forest that Dioscorides first described in 65 A.D.
as a treatment against consumption .
This mushroom grows in Washington State , Oregon , northern California , British Columbia , now thought to be extinct in Europe .
May not seem that large — let &apos;s get closer .
This is extremely rare fungus .
Our team — and we have a team of experts that go out — we went out 20 times in the old-growth forest last year .
We found one sample to be able to get into culture .
Preserving the genome of these fungi in the old-growth forest I think is absolutely critical for human health .
I &apos;ve been involved with the U.S. Defense Department BioShield program .
We submitted over 300 samples of mushrooms that were boiled in hot water , and mycelium harvesting these extracellular metabolites .
And a few years ago , we received these results .
We have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms that were highly active against poxviruses .
Dr. Earl Kern , who &apos;s a smallpox expert of the U.S. Defense Department , states that any compounds that have a selectivity index of two or more are active .
10 or greater are considered to be very active .
Our mushroom strains were in the highly active range .
There &apos;s a vetted press release that you can read — it &apos;s vetted by DOD — if you Google &quot; &quot; Stamets &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; smallpox . &quot; &quot; Or you can go to NPR.org and listen to a live interview .
So , encouraged by this , naturally we went to flu viruses .
And so , for the first time , I am showing this .
We have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms highly active against flu viruses .
Here &apos;s the selectivity index numbers — against pox , you saw 10s and 20s — now against flu viruses , compared to the ribavirin controls , we have an extraordinarily high activity .
And we &apos;re using a natural extract within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical .
We tried it against flu A viruses — H1N1 , H3N2 — as well as flu B viruses .
So then we tried a blend , and in a blend combination we tried it against H5N1 , and we got greater than 1,000 selectivity index .
( Applause ) I then think that we can make the argument that we should save the old-growth forest as a matter of national defense . ( Applause )
I became interested in entomopathogenic fungi — fungi that kill insects .
Our house was being destroyed by carpenter ants .
So , I went to the EPA homepage , and they were recommending studies with metarhizium species of a group of fungi that kill carpenter ants , as well as termites .
I did something that nobody else had done .
I actually chased the mycelium , when it stopped producing spores .
These are spores — this is in their spores .
I was able to morph the culture into a non-sporulating form .
And so the industry has spent over 100 million dollars specifically on bait stations to prevent termites from eating your house .
But the insects aren &apos;t stupid , and they would avoid the spores when they came close , and so I morphed the cultures into a non-sporulating form .
And I got my daughter &apos;s Barbie doll dish , I put it right where a bunch of carpenter ants were making debris fields , every day , in my house , and the ants were attracted to the mycelium , because there &apos;s no spores .
They gave it to the queen .
One week later , I had no sawdust piles whatsoever .
And then — a delicate dance between dinner and death — the mycelium is consumed by the ants , they become mummified , and , boing , a mushroom pops out of their head .
( Laughter ) Now after sporulation , the spores repel .
So , the house is no longer suitable for invasion .
So , you have a near-permanent solution for reinvasion of termites .
And so my house came down , I received my first patent against carpenter ants , termites and fire ants .
Then we tried extracts , and lo and behold , we can steer insects to different directions .
This has huge implications .
I then received my second patent — and this is a big one .
It &apos;s been called an Alexander Graham Bell patent .
It covers over 200,000 species .
This is the most disruptive technology — I &apos;ve been told by executives of the pesticide industry — that they have ever witnessed .
This could totally revamp the pesticide industries throughout the world .
You could fly 100 Ph.D. students under the umbrella of this concept , because my supposition is that entomopathogenic fungi , prior to sporulation , attract the very insects that are otherwise repelled by those spores .
And so I came up with a Life Box , because I needed a delivery system .
The Life Box — you &apos;re gonna be getting a DVD of the TED conference — you add soil , you add water , you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores , like of the Agarikon mushroom .
The seeds then are mothered by this mycelium .
And then you put tree seeds in here , and then you end up growing — potentially — an old-growth forest from a cardboard box .
I want to reinvent the delivery system , and the use of cardboard around the world , so they become ecological footprints .
If there &apos;s a YouTube-like site that you could put up , you could make it interactive , zip code specific — where people could join together , and through satellite imaging systems , through Virtual Earth or Google Earth , you could confirm carbon credits are being sequestered by the trees that are coming through Life Boxes .
You could take a cardboard box delivering shoes , you could add water — I developed this for the refugee community — corns , beans and squash and onions .
I took several containers — my wife said , if I could do this , anybody could — and I ended up growing a seed garden .
Then you harvest the seeds — and thank you , Eric Rasmussen , for your help on this — and then you &apos;re harvesting the seed garden .
Then you can harvest the kernels , and then you just need a few kernels .
I add mycelium to it , and then I inoculate the corncobs .
Now , three corncobs , no other grain — lots of mushrooms begin to form .
Too many withdrawals from the carbon bank , and so this population will be shut down .
But watch what happens here .
The mushrooms then are harvested , but very importantly , the mycelium has converted the cellulose into fungal sugars .
And so I thought , how could we address the energy crisis in this country ?
And we came up with Econol .
Generating ethanol from cellulose using mycelium as an intermediary — and you gain all the benefits that I &apos;ve described to you already .
But to go from cellulose to ethanol is ecologically unintelligent , and I think that we need to be econologically intelligent about the generation of fuels .
So , we build the carbon banks on the planet , renew the soils .
These are a species that we need to join with .
I think engaging mycelium can help save the world .
Thank you very much .

We are here today because &#91; the &#93; United Nations have defined goals for the progress of countries .
They &apos;re called Millennium Development Goals .
And the reason I really like these goals is that there are eight of them .
And by specifying eight different goals , the United Nations has said that there are so many things needed to change in a country in order to get the good life for people .
Look here — you have to end poverty , education , gender , child and maternal health , control infections , protect the environment and get the good global links between nations in every aspect from aid to trade .
There &apos;s a second reason I like these development goals , and that is because each and every one is measured .
Take child mortality ; the aim here is to reduce child mortality by two-thirds , from 1990 to 2015 .
That &apos;s a four percent reduction per year — and this , with measuring .
That &apos;s what makes the difference between political talking like this and really going for the important thing , a better life for people .
And what I &apos;m so happy about with this is that we have already documented that there are many countries in Asia , in the Middle East , in Latin America and East Europe that &#91; are &#93; reducing with this rate .
And even mighty Brazil is going down with five percent per year , and Turkey with seven percent per year .
So there &apos;s good news .
But then I hear people saying , &quot; &quot; There is no progress in Africa .
And there &apos;s not even statistics on Africa to know what is happening . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll prove them wrong on both points .
Come with me to the wonderful world of statistics .
I bring you to the webpage , ChildMortality.org , where you can take deaths in children below five years of age for all countries — it &apos;s done by U.N. specialists .
And I will take Kenya as an example .
Here you see the data .
Don &apos;t panic — don &apos;t panic now , I &apos;ll help you through this .
It looks nasty , like in college when you didn &apos;t like statistics .
But first thing , when you see dots like this , you have to ask yourself : from where do the data come ?
What is the origin of the data ?
Is it so that in Kenya , there are doctors and other specialists who write the death certificate at the death of the child and it &apos;s sent to the statistical office ?
No — low-income countries like Kenya still don &apos;t have that level of organization .
It exists , but it &apos;s not complete because so many deaths occur in the home with the family , and it &apos;s not registered .
What we rely on is not an incomplete system .
We have interviews , we have surveys .
And this is highly professional female interviewers who sit down for one hour with a woman and ask her about &#91; her &#93; birth history .
How many children did you have ?
Are they alive ?
If they died , at what age and what year ?
And then this is done in a representative sample of thousands of women in the country and put together in what used to be called a demographic health survey report .
But these surveys are costly , so they can only be done &#91; in &#93; three- to five-year intervals .
But they have good quality .
So this is a limitation .
And all these colored lines here are results ; each color is one survey .
But that &apos;s too complicated for today , so I &apos;ll simplify it for you , and I give you one average point for each survey .
This was 1977 , 1988 , 1992 , &apos; 97 and 2002 .
And when the experts in the U.N.
have got these surveys in place in their database , then they use advanced mathematical formulas to produce a trend line , and the trend line looks like this .
See here — it &apos;s the best fit they can get of this point .
But watch out — they continue the line beyond the last point out into nothing .
And they estimated that in 2008 , Kenya had per child mortality of 128 .
And I was sad , because we could see this reversal in Kenya with an increased child mortality in the 90s .
It was so tragic .
But in June , I got a mail in my inbox from Demographic Health Surveys , and it showed good news from Kenya .
I was so happy .
This was the estimate of the new survey .
Then it just took another three months for &#91; the &#93; U.N. to get it into their server , and on Friday we got the new trend line — it was down here .
Isn &apos;t it nice — isn &apos;t it nice , yeah ?
I was actually , on Friday , sitting in front of my computer , and I saw the death rate fall from 128 to 84 just that morning .
So we celebrated .
But now , when you have this trend line , how do we measure progress ?
I &apos;m going into some details here , because &#91; the &#93; U.N. do it like this .
They start &#91; in &#93; 1990 — they measure to 2009 .
They say , &quot; &quot; 0.9 percent , no progress . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s unfair .
As a professor , I think I have the right to propose something differently .
I would say , at least do this — 10 years is enough to follow the trend .
It &apos;s two surveys , and you can see what &apos;s happening now .
They have 2.4 percent .
Had I been in the Ministry of Health in Kenya , I may have joined these two points .
So what I &apos;m telling you is that we know the child mortality .
We have a decent trend .
It &apos;s coming into some tricky things then when we are measuring MDGs .
And the reason here for Africa is especially important , because &apos; 90s was a bad decade , not only in Kenya , but across Africa .
The HIV epidemic peaked .
There was resistance for the old malaria drugs , until we got the new drugs .
We got , later , the mosquito netting .
And there was socio-economic problems , which are now being solved at a much better scale .
So look at the average here — this is the average for all of sub-Saharan Africa .
And &#91; the &#93; U.N. says it &apos;s a reduction with 1.8 percent .
Now this sounds a little theoretical , but it &apos;s not so theoretical .
You know , these economists , they love money , they want more and more of it , they want it to grow .
So they calculate the percent annual growth rate of &#91; the &#93; economy .
We in public health , we hate child death , so we want less and less and less of child deaths .
So we calculate the percent reduction per year , but it &apos;s sort of the same percentage .
If your economy grows with four percent , you ought to reduce child mortality four percent ; if it &apos;s used well and people are really involved and can get the use of the resources in the way they want it .
So is this fair now to measure this over 19 years ?
An economist would never do that .
I have just divided it into two periods .
In the 90s , only 1.2 percent , only 1.2 percent .
Whereas now , second gear — it &apos;s like Africa had first gear , now they go into second gear .
But even this is not a fair representation of Africa , because it &apos;s an average , it &apos;s an average speed of reduction in Africa .
And look here when I take you into my bubble graphs .
Still here , child death per 1,000 on that axis .
Here we have &#91; the &#93; year .
And I &apos;m now giving you a wider picture than the MDG .
I start 50 years ago when Africa celebrated independence in most countries .
I give you Congo , which was high , Ghana — lower . And Kenya — even lower .
And what has happened over the years since then ? Here we go .
You can see , with independence , literacy improved and vaccinations started , smallpox was eradicated , hygiene was improved , and things got better .
But then , in the &apos; 80s , watch out here .
Congo got into civil war , and they leveled off here .
Ghana got very ahead , fast .
This was the backlash in Kenya , and Ghana bypassed , but then Kenya and Ghana go down together — still a standstill in Congo .
That &apos;s where we are today .
You can see it doesn &apos;t make sense to make an average of this zero improvement and this very fast improvement .
Time has come to stop thinking about sub-Saharan Africa as one place .
Their countries are so different , and they merit to be recognized in the same way , as we don &apos;t talk about Europe as one place .
I can tell you that the economy in Greece and Sweden are very different — everyone knows that .
And they are judged , each country , on how they are doing .
So let me show the wider picture .
My country , Sweden : 1800 , we were up there .
What a strange personality disorder we must have , counting the children so meticulously in spite of a high child death rate .
It &apos;s very strange . It &apos;s sort of embarrassing .
But we had that habit in Sweden , you know , that we counted all the child deaths , even if we didn &apos;t do anything about it .
And then , you see , these were famine years .
These were bad years , and people got fed up with Sweden .
My ancestors moved to the United States .
And eventually , soon they started to get better and better here .
And here we got better education , and we got health service , and child mortality came down .
We never had a war ; Sweden was in peace all this time .
But look , the rate of lowering in Sweden was not fast .
Sweden achieved a low child mortality because we started early .
We had primary school actually started in 1842 .
And then you get that wonderful effect when we got female literacy one generation later .
You have to realize that the investments we do in progress are long-term investments .
It &apos;s not about just five years — it &apos;s long-term investments .
And Sweden never reached &#91; the &#93; Millennium Development Goal rate , 3.1 percent when I calculated .
So we are off track — that &apos;s what Sweden is .
But you don &apos;t talk about it so much .
We want others to be better than we were , and indeed , others have been better .
Let me show you Thailand , see what a success story , Thailand from the 1960s — how they went down here and reached almost the same child mortality levels as Sweden .
And I &apos;ll give you another story — Egypt , the most hidden , glorious success in public health .
Egypt was up here in 1960 , higher than Congo .
The Nile Delta was a misery for children with diarrheal disease and malaria and a lot of problems .
And then they got the Aswan Dam . They got electricity in their homes , they increased education and they got primary health care .
And down they went , you know .
And they got safer water , they eradicated malaria .
And isn &apos;t it a success story .
Millennium Development Goal rates for child mortality is fully possible .
And the good thing is that Ghana today is going with the same rate as Egypt did at its fastest .
Kenya is now speeding up .
Here we have a problem .
We have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill .
Now , let me now bring you to a wider picture , a wider picture of child mortality .
I &apos;m going to show you the relationship between child mortality on this axis here — this axis here is child mortality — and here I have the family size .
The relationship between child mortality and family size .
One , two , three , four children per woman : six , seven , eight children per woman .
This is , once again , 1960 — 50 years ago .
Each bubble is a country — the color , you can see , a continent .
The dark blue here is sub-Saharan Africa .
And the size of the bubble is the population .
And these are the so-called &quot; &quot; developing &quot; &quot; countries .
They had high , or very high , child mortality and family size , six to eight .
And the ones over there , they were so-called Western countries .
They had low child mortality and small families .
What has happened ?
What I want you &#91; to do &#93; now is to see with your own eyes the relation between fall in child mortality and decrease in family size .
I just want not to have any room for doubt — you have to see that for yourself .
This is what happened . Now I start the world .
Here we come down with the eradication of smallpox , better education , health service .
It got down there — China comes into the Western box here .
And here Brazil is in the Western Box .
India is approaching . The first African countries coming into the Western box , and we get a lot a new neighbors .
Welcome to a decent life .
Come on . We want everyone down there .
This is the vision we have , isn &apos;t it .
And look now , the first African countries here are coming in .
There we are today .
There is no such thing as a &quot; &quot; Western world &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; developing world . &quot; &quot; This is the report from &#91; the &#93; U.N. , which came out on Friday .
It &apos;s very good — &quot; &quot; Levels and Trends in Child Mortality &quot; &quot; — except this page .
This page is very bad ; it &apos;s a categorization of countries .
It labels &quot; &quot; developing countries , &quot; &quot; — I can read from the list here — developing countries : Republic of Korea — South Korea .
Huh ?
They get Samsung , how can they be &#91; a &#93; developing country ?
They have here Singapore .
They have the lowest child mortality in the world , Singapore .
They bypassed Sweden five years ago , and they are labeled a developing country .
They have here Qatar .
It &apos;s the richest country in the world with Al Jazeera .
How the heck could they be &#91; a &#93; developing country ?
This is crap .
( Applause ) The rest here is good — the rest is good .
We have to have a modern concept , which fits to the data .
And we have to realize that we are all going to into this , down to here .
What is the importance now with the relations here .
Look — even if we look in Africa — these are the African countries .
You can clearly see the relation with falling child mortality and decreasing family size , even within Africa .
It &apos;s very clear that this is what happens .
And a very important piece of research came out on Friday from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle showing that almost 50 percent of the fall in child mortality can be attributed to female education .
That is , when we get girls in school , we &apos;ll get an impact 15 to 20 years later , which is a secular trend which is very strong .
That &apos;s why we must have that long-term perspective , but we must measure the impact over 10-year periods .
It &apos;s fully possible to get child mortality down in all of these countries and to get them down in the corner where we all would like to live together .
And of course , lowering child mortality is a matter of utmost importance from humanitarian aspects .
It &apos;s a decent life for children , we are talking about .
But it is also a strategic investment in the future of all mankind , because it &apos;s about the environment .
We will not be able to manage the environment and avoid the terrible climate crisis if we don &apos;t stabilize the world population .
Let &apos;s be clear about that .
And the way to do that , that is to get child mortality down , get access to family planning and behind that drive female education .
And that is fully possible . Let &apos;s do it .
Thank you very much .

Many of us carry this image of this all-knowing superhero who stands and commands and protects his followers .
We conducted a study of 4,000 companies , and we asked them , let &apos;s see the effectiveness of your leadership development programs .
That means that despite corporate training programs , off-sites , assessments , coaching , all of these things , more than half the companies had failed to grow enough great leaders .
You may be asking yourself , is my company helping me to prepare to be a great 21st-century leader ?
Now , I &apos;ve spent 25 years of my professional life observing what makes great leaders .
I &apos;ve worked inside Fortune 500 companies , I &apos;ve advised over 200 CEOs , and I &apos;ve cultivated more leadership pipelines than you can imagine .
But a few years ago , I noticed a disturbing trend in leadership preparation .
Now , these recurring stories cause me to ask two questions .
Why are the leadership gaps widening when there &apos;s so much more investment in leadership development ?
And what are the great leaders doing distinctly different to thrive and grow ?
And so I did things like travel to South Africa , where I had an opportunity to understand how Nelson Mandela was ahead of his time in anticipating and navigating his political , social and economic context .
I also met a number of nonprofit leaders who , despite very limited financial resources , were making a huge impact in the world , often bringing together seeming adversaries .
I want to share some of those with you now .
( &quot; &quot; What makes a great leader in the 21st century ? &quot; &quot; ) In a 21st-century world , which is more global , digitally enabled and transparent , with faster speeds of information flow and innovation , and where nothing big gets done without some kind of a complex matrix , relying on traditional development practices will stunt your growth as a leader .
Leadership in the 21st century is defined and evidenced by three questions .
The answer to this question is on your calendar .
Who are you spending time with ? On what topics ?
Where are you traveling ? What are you reading ?
Great leaders are not head-down .
They see around corners , shaping their future , not just reacting to it .
The second question is , what is the diversity measure of your personal and professional stakeholder network ?
You know , we hear often about good ol &apos; boy networks and they &apos;re certainly alive and well in many institutions .
But to some extent , we all have a network of people that we &apos;re comfortable with .
So this question is about your capacity to develop relationships with people that are very different than you .
And those differences can be biological , physical , functional , political , cultural , socioeconomic .
Great leaders dare to be different .
They don &apos;t just talk about risk-taking , they actually do it .
And one of the leaders shared with me the fact that the most impactful development comes when you are able to build the emotional stamina to withstand people telling you that your new idea is naïve or reckless or just plain stupid .
Now interestingly , the people who will join you are not your usual suspects in your network .
They &apos;re often people that think differently and therefore are willing to join you in taking a courageous leap .
And it &apos;s a leap , not a step .
More than traditional leadership programs , answering these three questions will determine your effectiveness as a 21st-century leader .
So what makes a great leader in the 21st century ?
I &apos;ve met many , and they stand out .
They are women and men who are preparing themselves not for the comfortable predictability of yesterday but also for the realities of today and all of those unknown possibilities of tomorrow .
Thank you .
Antiquated zoning and land-use regulations are still used to this day to continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood .
But I &apos;ll tell you later , if you want to know .
I have a vision for each one of you , and the vision I have for you is that when you wake up in the morning , your blood is singing at the thought of being who you are and doing what you do ; that as you go through the day , you can literally sink to your knees in gratitude at the tremendous good fortune that &apos;s been bestowed on you ; that as you go through the day , you become radiantly alive several times .
And if your life isn &apos;t like that , I &apos;d like to humbly suggest that you &apos;re wasting your life .
A life is too short to be wasted .
So what I propose to do in the next 17 minutes — I &apos;ve used up one minute already — is to give you a set of powerful tools which can get you started on being there .
Is that of interest to you ?
Audience : Yes .
Srikumar Rao : OK .
This is a conference on happiness , but even if it wasn &apos;t a conference on happiness , would it be right if I said that in some way , shape , fashion or form , you &apos;re devoting your entire life to being happy ?
Everything you do — your job , family , children , relationships , whatever — is a quest for happiness .
Correct ?
I &apos;d like you to think about the following : What do you have to get in order to be happy ?
We &apos;re just going to spend a minute on this .
What do you have to get in order to be happy ?
Anybody , quick ?
When I conduct this experiment , a bunch of stuff comes up : vast wealth , trophy spouse , good health , lots of travel , time , etc , etc , etc .
Is that correct ?
So , vast wealth can make you happy . Vast wealth can disappear tomorrow .
A number of people in the financial sector have discovered this already .
So whatever you get that can make you happy can go away .
Where does that leave you ?
Not a very nice place , right ?
I have a different proposition to suggest to you .
What I have to suggest to you is that there is nothing that you have to get , do or be in order to be happy .
Let me repeat that : there is nothing that you have to get , do or be in order to be happy .
In fact , happiness is your innate nature .
It is hardwired into you . It is part of your DNA .
You cannot not be happy .
Now , all of you are very polite , and in some of the other forums I speak in , such as top business schools , they &apos;re not so polite .
And invariably , somebody articulates what many of you are thinking , which is : &quot; &quot; If happiness is my innate nature , how come I am not experiencing it ?
How come I am experiencing my life sucks ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And the answer to that is actually very simple .
You have spent your entire life learning to be unhappy .
Let me repeat that : you have spent your entire life learning to be unhappy .
And the way we learn to be unhappy is by buying into a particular mental model .
A mental model is a notion we have that this is the way the world works .
All of us have mental models , we &apos;ve got dozens of mental models .
We &apos;ve got mental models on how to find a job , how to get ahead at work , how to pick a restaurant to eat at , how to have a movie to go to ... dozens of them .
The problem isn &apos;t that we have mental models .
The problem is that we don &apos;t know that we have mental models .
We think this is the way the world works .
And the more we invest in a mental model , the more it appears that this , in fact , is the way the world works .
But it isn &apos;t : it &apos;s just a mental model , and the mental model we have that we buy into so strongly is that we have to get something so we can do something so we can be something .
Like , we have to get a great deal of money so we can travel to exotic places so we can be happy .
We have to be in a relationship so we can have great sex so we can be happy .
All of this is a variation of the if-then model .
And the if-then model is : if this happens , then we will be happy .
If I were to get a better job , if I were to get more money , if my boss would have a heart attack , if only I was married , if only my wife would leave me — ( Laughter ) if only I had children , if my children would grow up and go to college ...
It doesn &apos;t matter what it is .
The whole notion is if this happens , then I will be happy .
And right now , the only thing that &apos;s different between the persons in this audience is what is the particular &quot; &quot; if &quot; &quot; that you are focusing on ?
And the only thing that &apos;s different between you now and where you were 10 years ago is what is the particular &quot; &quot; if &quot; &quot; that you were focusing on ?
Think about your life 10 years ago .
Spend a minute doing that .
Ten years ago , if you remember clearly , there were certain things you wanted .
Is that correct ?
Odds are pretty good that many of those things you wanted 10 years ago you now have .
Is that correct ?
Where has that left you ?
In exactly the same place , right ?
What we don &apos;t realize is the model itself is flawed .
The if-then model — &quot; &quot; If this happens I will be happy &quot; &quot; — the model itself is flawed .
But instead of recognizing that it is the model itself that &apos;s flawed , what we do is spend enormous amounts of time changing the &quot; &quot; if . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , well , I thought if I became CEO it would help , but now I realize it &apos;s not that I want to become a CEO .
I want to become the billionaire CEO , and then I will be happy . &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got your own variation on that .
But it &apos;s the model itself that &apos;s flawed , not what you put on the &quot; &quot; if &quot; &quot; side of the equation .
I can demonstrate that to you .
Can any of you recall a time when you were confronted with a scene of such spectacular beauty that it took you outside of yourself into a place of great serenity ?
Maybe a rainbow , a mountain range , a valley , the sea .
And if you remember that — raise your hands if you could .
Virtually all of you could , right ?
Have you ever wondered why that happened ?
The reason that happened is that somehow , for some reason , at that instant , you accepted the universe exactly as it was .
You didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a beautiful rainbow , but it &apos;s kind of off to the left , and if I could move it 200 yards to the right , it would be ever so much more beautiful . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a beautiful valley , but the tree in the foreground has too many crooked branches .
So if you gave me a chainsaw and 20 minutes , I &apos;d make it ever so much better . &quot; &quot; Oh no , the rainbow off-center was just fine .
The tree with its crooked branches was just fine .
And the moment you accepted the universe just as it was , your habitual-wanting self dropped away , and the happiness which is your innate nature surfaced , and you felt it .
And I know you felt it because now , even now after all those years , you can still remember it .
The problem is that your life right now , with all of the problems that you have — more precisely , all of the problems that you think you have — is equally perfect .
But you do not accept it .
In fact , you &apos;re spending all your time striving with might and main to make it different .
You are not accepting it .
And when you &apos;re not accepting it , you &apos;re buying into the if-then model : if this happens , then I will be happy .
And it &apos;s the model itself that is flawed .
So let me show you how you can get out of that , or at least you can begin the steps towards getting out of that .
I &apos;d like to share with you that action .
We all live our lives because we want to achieve something , correct ?
You know , we are here and we want to have something .
Alex wants to have a successful conference .
You know , many of you want to have great programs for your companies that are very successful .
You want to progress , have more money , all of that , is that correct ?
Each of those is an outcome ; you would like something to happen .
Now , I &apos;d like you to think about the following : actions are within your control , not entirely , but to a large extent .
The outcome is completely out of your control .
OK ?
Actions are within your control .
The outcome is completely outside your control .
Have any of you recognized that when you have a goal and you start to work towards it , some of the time you don &apos;t achieve your goal , and some of the time what you get is the exact opposite of what you wanted ?
Has that happened to any of you ?
Like there was a friend of mine who said , &quot; &quot; Gee , you know , I have not been paying a lot of attention to my wife , and this has to change . &quot; &quot; So the next time we went on a business trip , he bought a very expensive dress for her .
And this was his way of showing , you know , I care for you , and nice things would happen .
And when he presented the gift to his wife , her immediate reaction was , &quot; After 20 years of marriage , you don &apos;t know my size ? &quot;
( Laughter ) &quot; And furthermore , don &apos;t you know I never wear this kind of thing ? &quot;
And the next thing you know , he had a full-blown marital spat .
Has that happened to any of you ?
You &apos;ve taken action for a particular outcome and the outcome you got was the exact opposite of what you wanted ?
Happens all the time .
Well , we live in a world where what we think of , what we invest in , is the outcome .
We define our life in the following way : here I am , here is where I want to go , these are the steps I have to take in order to get from where I am to where I want to go , and if I succeed , life is wonderful .
And if I don &apos;t , then I have failed , life is no good , life sucks .
True ? False ?
That is how we live .
We invest in the outcome , and as I &apos;ve just pointed out , the outcome is frequently different from what we would like , and sometimes the diametric opposite of what we would like .
You invest in the outcome and you are guaranteed to have more than your share of frustration , angst and all the rest of the stuff that makes life suck .
There is an alternative .
And the alternative is that you do not invest in the outcome , you invest in the process .
And the best way to describe that is a quote by John Wooden .
I don &apos;t know how many of you are familiar with John Wooden .
He &apos;s very well-known in the United States and certainly among basketball fans .
He &apos;s the only person ever to make the basketball Hall of Fame both as a player and as a coach .
And what he told his entering team — he led UCLA to an unprecedented number of victories and finals in the NCAA — and what he used to tell any new team is he never spoke about winning .
He always said , &quot; &quot; When it &apos;s over and you look in the mirror , did you do the best that you were capable of ?
And if you did the best that you were capable of , the score doesn &apos;t matter .
But I would suspect that if you did the best that you were capable of , you will find the score to your liking . &quot; &quot; That is investing in a process .
What we do is the exact opposite .
We invest in the outcome .
This is what I want — oh , I want it so desperately , because if I get it I will be happy .
And you try with might and main , to do whatever you can , but you are always focusing on , &quot; &quot; This is the outcome . &quot; &quot; Now , focusing on the outcome is fine .
It gives you direction .
Investing in the outcome means that you make the achievement of a particular outcome dependent for your well-being .
And that is a surefire recipe for failure .
What you can do is something else .
You can invest in the process .
That is , once you have determined , here is where I am , here is where I want to be , and that &apos;s fine , you focus on the outcome only to the extent that it gives you direction , and then you invest yourself completely in the process .
You say , here are the steps you want to take , and you put everything into it .
And if you succeed , wonderful .
And if you don &apos;t succeed , still wonderful , because now you have a new starting point , and from that new starting point , you select another outcome and keep going .
And when you do that , you will find that every day is a blast .
Let me give you an example .
And if you have children — raise your hands if you have children .
Have you ever seen a small child learn to walk ?
What happens , and this happens typically between 11 and 13 months , is the child gets up and she sees everybody walking , she wants to walk , she gets up , she falls down , she starts crying and momma runs up and comforts her , kisses the place , makes it well .
She tries again , falls down , mommy runs up again .
After some time , mommy feels tired and no longer runs up and the child stops crying , and then she gets up , takes a step and doesn &apos;t fall down , and then she takes another , and a beautiful smile comes on her face .
And very soon , generally within 24 hours , she &apos;s walking all over the place , upsetting your living room arrangements .
And you know you &apos;ve gone to a new stage of parenting .
Right ?
Now , imagine what would happen if each time the child fell , she would say , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , I failed again .
I &apos;m never going to learn to walk . &quot; &quot; And you have to get counseling for her to help her deal with feelings of inadequacy and not being able to achieve and fail yet again .
How long do you think it would take her to learn to walk if you had to do that , if every three times she fell down , you had to get a counselor to counsel her and so on ?
Sounds funny , doesn &apos;t it ?
But that is exactly what we &apos;re doing .
What the child is doing is focusing on the process .
She &apos;s investing in the process , not in the outcome .
What we do is the exact opposite .
As we grow up , we lose the ability to invest in the process , we start investing in the outcome .
By definition the outcome is outside of our control , and if that &apos;s where we spend all of our emotional energy , we are going to get drained as we do .
But if , on the other hand , we said , &quot; &quot; Here is the outcome , I am going to invest in the process and give it every single bit I could , &quot; &quot; every day is a blast , and you &apos;re well on your way to achieving the vision that I outlined to you .
The question that I get all the time , is people say , &quot; &quot; Professor Rao , but nothing makes me passionate . &quot; &quot; So I say , &quot; &quot; OK , what would ? &quot; &quot; And they invariably come up with , you know , here is a list of things .
Here &apos;s my job and here &apos;s how much it pays , this is the kind of person my boss is , the kind of people my colleagues are , and here &apos;s how my customers are , here &apos;s how much I travel , here &apos;s how big my office is , how deep the carpeting is , how many windows I have — a bunch of parameters .
And what I tell them is what I want to share with you , because all of that stuff — first of all , it doesn &apos;t exist .
But second , even if it did and you were plugged into it , it would not take more than six months for you to be the same sorry , miserable self there as you are now , because passion exists inside you .
It does not exist in the job .
And if you don &apos;t find a way to ignite it within you right where you are , you are not going to find it outside .
But if you do find a way to ignite it where you are , then you will find that the external world rearranges itself to accommodate the new person that you are becoming .
And as you do that , you will find that miracles happen on a regular basis .
Persons come up whom you &apos;re delighted to meet .
New people enter your life .
It &apos;s just a breeze , because all you do in your life is you take journeys .
You came here to this conference ; you went on a journey .
You hang around the water cooler , talking about how terrible your place of work is ; you went on a journey .
You watch &quot; &quot; Desperate Housewives , &quot; &quot; you go on a journey .
You go on a journey where 40-something women are having affairs with 19-something gardeners while the husbands are playing around with models .
All you do is go on journeys .
There &apos;s nothing wrong with that , but just ask yourself , &quot; &quot; Is this a journey I want to take ?
Does this take me to a place I want to spend time ? &quot; &quot; And if you start doing that , you will find that your life changes .
The kind of people you meet , the things you talk about , the movies you go to , the books you read — everything changes .
And you begin all of that by focusing on the process .
Invest in the process , not in the outcome .
Thank you .
I want to talk to you today a little bit about predictable irrationality .
And my interest in irrational behavior started many years ago in the hospital .
I was burned very badly .
And if you spend a lot of time in hospital , you &apos;ll see a lot of types of irrationalities .
And the one that particularly bothered me in the burn department was the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me .
Now , you must have all taken a Band-Aid off at some point , and you must have wondered what &apos;s the right approach .
Do you rip it off quickly — short duration but high intensity — or do you take your Band-Aid off slowly — you take a long time , but each second is not as painful — which one of those is the right approach ?
The nurses in my department thought that the right approach was the ripping one , so they would grab hold and they would rip , and they would grab hold and they would rip .
And because I had 70 percent of my body burned , it would take about an hour .
And as you can imagine , I hated that moment of ripping with incredible intensity .
And I would try to reason with them and say , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t we try something else ?
Why don &apos;t we take it a little longer — maybe two hours instead of an hour — and have less of this intensity ? &quot; &quot; And the nurses told me two things .
They told me that they had the right model of the patient — that they knew what was the right thing to do to minimize my pain — and they also told me that the word patient doesn &apos;t mean to make suggestions or to interfere or ...
This is not just in Hebrew , by the way .
It &apos;s in every language I &apos;ve had experience with so far .
And , you know , there &apos;s not much — there wasn &apos;t much I could do , and they kept on doing what they were doing .
And about three years later , when I left the hospital , I started studying at the university .
And one of the most interesting lessons I learned was that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question in some abstract way , and you can try to examine this question , maybe learn something about the world .
So that &apos;s what I did .
I was still interested in this question of how do you take bandages off burn patients .
So originally I didn &apos;t have much money , so I went to a hardware store and I bought a carpenter &apos;s vice .
And I would bring people to the lab and I would put their finger in it , and I would crunch it a little bit .
( Laughter ) And I would crunch it for long periods and short periods , and pain that went up and pain that went down , and with breaks and without breaks — all kinds of versions of pain .
And when I finished hurting people a little bit , I would ask them , so , how painful was this ? Or , how painful was this ?
Or , if you had to choose between the last two , which one would you choose ?
( Laughter ) I kept on doing this for a while . ( Laughter )
And then , like all good academic projects , I got more funding .
I moved to sounds , electrical shocks — I even had a pain suit that I could get people to feel much more pain .
But at the end of this process , what I learned was that the nurses were wrong .
Here were wonderful people with good intentions and plenty of experience , and nevertheless they were getting things wrong predictably all the time .
It turns out that because we don &apos;t encode duration in the way that we encode intensity , I would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer and the intensity was lower .
It turns out it would have been better to start with my face , which was much more painful , and move toward my legs , giving me a trend of improvement over time — that would have been also less painful .
And it also turns out that it would have been good to give me breaks in the middle to kind of recuperate from the pain .
All of these would have been great things to do , and my nurses had no idea .
And from that point on I started thinking , are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong in this particular decision , or is it a more general case ?
And it turns out it &apos;s a more general case — there &apos;s a lot of mistakes we do .
And I want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities , and I want to talk to you about cheating .
And the reason I picked cheating is because it &apos;s interesting , but also it tells us something , I think , about the stock market situation we &apos;re in .
So , my interest in cheating started when Enron came on the scene , exploded all of a sudden , and I started thinking about what is happening here .
Is it the case that there was kind of a few apples who are capable of doing these things , or are we talking a more endemic situation , that many people are actually capable of behaving this way ?
So , like we usually do , I decided to do a simple experiment .
And here &apos;s how it went .
If you were in the experiment , I would pass you a sheet of paper with 20 simple math problems that everybody could solve , but I wouldn &apos;t give you enough time .
When the five minutes were over , I would say , &quot; Pass me the sheets of paper , and I &apos;ll pay you a dollar per question . &quot;
People did this . I would pay people four dollars for their task — on average people would solve four problems .
Other people I would tempt to cheat .
I would pass their sheet of paper .
When the five minutes were over , I would say , &quot; &quot; Please shred the piece of paper .
Put the little pieces in your pocket or in your backpack , and tell me how many questions you got correctly . &quot; &quot; People now solved seven questions on average .
Now , it wasn &apos;t as if there was a few bad apples — a few people cheated a lot .
Instead , what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit .
Now , in economic theory , cheating is a very simple cost-benefit analysis .
You say , what &apos;s the probability of being caught ?
How much do I stand to gain from cheating ?
And how much punishment would I get if I get caught ?
And you weigh these options out — you do the simple cost-benefit analysis , and you decide whether it &apos;s worthwhile to commit the crime or not .
So , we try to test this .
For some people , we varied how much money they could get away with — how much money they could steal .
We paid them 10 cents per correct question , 50 cents , a dollar , five dollars , 10 dollars per correct question .
You would expect that as the amount of money on the table increases , people would cheat more , but in fact it wasn &apos;t the case .
We got a lot of people cheating by stealing by a little bit .
What about the probability of being caught ?
Some people shredded half the sheet of paper , so there was some evidence left .
Some people shredded the whole sheet of paper .
Some people shredded everything , went out of the room , and paid themselves from the bowl of money that had over 100 dollars .
You would expect that as the probability of being caught goes down , people would cheat more , but again , this was not the case .
Again , a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit , and they were insensitive to these economic incentives .
So we said , &quot; &quot; If people are not sensitive to the economic rational theory explanations , to these forces , what could be going on ? &quot; &quot; And we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces .
At one hand , we all want to look at ourselves in the mirror and feel good about ourselves , so we don &apos;t want to cheat .
On the other hand , we can cheat a little bit , and still feel good about ourselves .
So , maybe what is happening is that there &apos;s a level of cheating we can &apos;t go over , but we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree , as long as it doesn &apos;t change our impressions about ourselves .
We call this like a personal fudge factor .
Now , how would you test a personal fudge factor ?
Initially we said , what can we do to shrink the fudge factor ?
So , we got people to the lab , and we said , &quot; We have two tasks for you today . &quot;
First , we asked half the people to recall either 10 books they read in high school , or to recall The Ten Commandments , and then we tempted them with cheating .
Turns out the people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments — and in our sample nobody could recall all of The Ten Commandments — but those people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments , given the opportunity to cheat , did not cheat at all .
It wasn &apos;t that the more religious people — the people who remembered more of the Commandments — cheated less , and the less religious people — the people who couldn &apos;t remember almost any Commandments — cheated more .
The moment people thought about trying to recall The Ten Commandments , they stopped cheating .
In fact , even when we gave self-declared atheists the task of swearing on the Bible and we give them a chance to cheat , they don &apos;t cheat at all .
Now , Ten Commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system , so we said , &quot; Why don &apos;t we get people to sign the honor code ? &quot;
So , we got people to sign , &quot; I understand that this short survey falls under the MIT Honor Code . &quot;
Then they shredded it . No cheating whatsoever .
And this is particularly interesting , because MIT doesn &apos;t have an honor code .
( Laughter ) So , all this was about decreasing the fudge factor .
What about increasing the fudge factor ?
The first experiment — I walked around MIT and I distributed six-packs of Cokes in the refrigerators — these were common refrigerators for the undergrads .
And I came back to measure what we technically call the half-lifetime of Coke — how long does it last in the refrigerators ?
As you can expect it doesn &apos;t last very long ; people take it .
In contrast , I took a plate with six one-dollar bills , and I left those plates in the same refrigerators .
No bill ever disappeared .
Now , this is not a good social science experiment , so to do it better I did the same experiment as I described to you before .
A third of the people we passed the sheet , they gave it back to us .
A third of the people we passed it to , they shredded it , they came to us and said , &quot; Mr. Experimenter , I solved X problems . Give me X dollars . &quot;
A third of the people , when they finished shredding the piece of paper , they came to us and said , &quot; Mr Experimenter , I solved X problems . Give me X tokens . &quot;
We did not pay them with dollars ; we paid them with something else .
And then they took the something else , they walked 12 feet to the side , and exchanged it for dollars .
Think about the following intuition .
How bad would you feel about taking a pencil from work home , compared to how bad would you feel about taking 10 cents from a petty cash box ?
These things feel very differently .
Would being a step removed from cash for a few seconds by being paid by token make a difference ?
Our subjects doubled their cheating .
I &apos;ll tell you what I think about this and the stock market in a minute .
But this did not solve the big problem I had with Enron yet , because in Enron , there &apos;s also a social element .
People see each other behaving .
In fact , every day when we open the news we see examples of people cheating .
What does this cause us ?
So , we did another experiment .
We got a big group of students to be in the experiment , and we prepaid them .
So everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment , and we told them that at the end , we asked them to pay us back the money they didn &apos;t make . OK ?
The same thing happens .
When we give people the opportunity to cheat , they cheat .
They cheat just by a little bit , all the same .
But in this experiment we also hired an acting student .
This acting student stood up after 30 seconds , and said , &quot; I solved everything . What do I do now ? &quot;
And the experimenter said , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;ve finished everything , go home .
That &apos;s it . The task is finished . &quot; &quot; So , now we had a student — an acting student — that was a part of the group .
Nobody knew it was an actor .
And they clearly cheated in a very , very serious way .
What would happen to the other people in the group ?
Will they cheat more , or will they cheat less ?
Here is what happens .
It turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirt they &apos;re wearing .
Here is the thing .
We ran this at Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh .
And at Pittsburgh there are two big universities , Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh .
All of the subjects sitting in the experiment were Carnegie Mellon students .
When the actor who was getting up was a Carnegie Mellon student — he was actually a Carnegie Mellon student — but he was a part of their group , cheating went up .
But when he actually had a University of Pittsburgh sweatshirt , cheating went down .
( Laughter ) Now , this is important , because remember , when the moment the student stood up , it made it clear to everybody that they could get away with cheating , because the experimenter said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve finished everything . Go home , &quot; &quot; and they went with the money .
So it wasn &apos;t so much about the probability of being caught again .
It was about the norms for cheating .
If somebody from our in-group cheats and we see them cheating , we feel it &apos;s more appropriate , as a group , to behave this way .
But if it &apos;s somebody from another group , these terrible people — I mean , not terrible in this — but somebody we don &apos;t want to associate ourselves with , from another university , another group , all of a sudden people &apos;s awareness of honesty goes up — a little bit like The Ten Commandments experiment — and people cheat even less .
So , what have we learned from this about cheating ?
We &apos;ve learned that a lot of people can cheat .
They cheat just by a little bit .
When we remind people about their morality , they cheat less .
When we get bigger distance from cheating , from the object of money , for example , people cheat more .
And when we see cheating around us , particularly if it &apos;s a part of our in-group , cheating goes up .
Now , if we think about this in terms of the stock market , think about what happens .
What happens in a situation when you create something where you pay people a lot of money to see reality in a slightly distorted way ?
Would they not be able to see it this way ?
Of course they would .
What happens when you do other things , like you remove things from money ?
You call them stock , or stock options , derivatives , mortgage-backed securities .
Could it be that with those more distant things , it &apos;s not a token for one second , it &apos;s something that is many steps removed from money for a much longer time — could it be that people will cheat even more ?
And what happens to the social environment when people see other people behave around them ?
I think all of those forces worked in a very bad way in the stock market .
More generally , I want to tell you something about behavioral economics .
We have many intuitions in our life , and the point is that many of these intuitions are wrong .
The question is , are we going to test those intuitions ?
We can think about how we &apos;re going to test this intuition in our private life , in our business life , and most particularly when it goes to policy , when we think about things like No Child Left Behind , when you create new stock markets , when you create other policies — taxation , health care and so on .
And the difficulty of testing our intuition was the big lesson I learned when I went back to the nurses to talk to them .
So I went back to talk to them and tell them what I found out about removing bandages .
And I learned two interesting things .
One was that my favorite nurse , Ettie , told me that I did not take her pain into consideration .
She said , &quot; &quot; Of course , you know , it was very painful for you .
But think about me as a nurse , taking , removing the bandages of somebody I liked , and had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time .
Creating so much torture was not something that was good for me , too . &quot; &quot; And she said maybe part of the reason was it was difficult for her .
But it was actually more interesting than that , because she said , &quot; &quot; I did not think that your intuition was right .
I felt my intuition was correct . &quot; &quot; So , if you think about all of your intuitions , it &apos;s very hard to believe that your intuition is wrong .
And she said , &quot; &quot; Given the fact that I thought my intuition was right ... &quot; &quot; — she thought her intuition was right — it was very difficult for her to accept doing a difficult experiment to try and check whether she was wrong .
But in fact , this is the situation we &apos;re all in all the time .
We have very strong intuitions about all kinds of things — our own ability , how the economy works , how we should pay school teachers .
But unless we start testing those intuitions , we &apos;re not going to do better .
And just think about how better my life would have been if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition , and how everything would have been better if we just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions .
Thank you very much .
Almost two years ago , I was driving in my car in Germany , and I turned on the radio .
Europe at the time was in the middle of the Euro crisis , and all the headlines were about European countries getting downgraded by rating agencies in the United States .
I listened and thought to myself , &quot; &quot; What are these rating agencies , and why is everybody so upset about their work ? &quot; &quot; Well , if you were sitting next to me in the car that day and would have told me that I would devote the next years to trying to reform them , obviously I would have called you crazy .
But guess what &apos;s really crazy : the way these rating agencies are run .
And I would like to explain to you not only why it &apos;s time to change this , but also how we can do it .
So let me tell you a little bit about what rating agencies really do .
As you would read a car magazine before purchasing a new car or taking a look at a product review before deciding which kind of tablet or phone to get , investors are reading ratings before they decide in which kind of product they are investing their money .
A rating can range from a so-called AAA , which means it &apos;s a top-performing product , and it can go down to the level of the so-called BBB- , which means it &apos;s a fairly risky investment .
Rating agencies are rating companies .
They are rating banks .
They are rating even financial products like the infamous mortgage-backed securities .
But they can also rate countries , and these ratings are called sovereign ratings , and I would like to focus in particular on these sovereign ratings .
And I can tell , as you &apos;re listening to me right now , you &apos;re thinking , so why should I really care about this , right ?
Be honest .
Well , ratings affect you .
They affect all of us .
If a rating agency rates a country , it basically assesses and evaluates a country &apos;s debt and the ability and willingness of a country to repay its debt .
So if a country gets downgraded by a rating agency , the country has to pay more in order to borrow money on the international markets .
So it affects you as a citizen and as a taxpayer , because you and your fellow countrymen have to pony up more in order to borrow .
But what if a country can &apos;t afford to pay more because it &apos;s maybe too expensive ?
Well , then the country has less available for other services , like roads , schools , healthcare .
And this is the reason why you should care , because sovereign ratings affect everyone .
They should be transparent , accessible , and available to everyone at no cost .
But here &apos;s the situation : the rating agency market is dominated by three players and three players only — Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s , Moody &apos;s , and Fitch — and we know whenever there is a market concentration , there is really no competition .
The second point , would you really buy a car just based on the advice of the dealer ?
Obviously not , right ? That would be irresponsible .
But that &apos;s actually what &apos;s going on in the rating agency sector every single day .
The customers of these rating agencies , like countries or companies , they are paying for their own ratings , and obviously this is creating a conflict of interest .
The third point is , the rating agencies are not really telling us how they are coming up with their ratings , but in this day and age , you can &apos;t even sell a candy bar without listing everything that &apos;s inside .
But for ratings , a crucial element of our economy , we really do not know what all the different ingredients are .
We are allowing the rating agencies to be intransparent about their work , and we need to change this .
I think there is no doubt that the sector needs a complete overhaul , not just a trimming at the margins .
I think it &apos;s time for a bold move .
I think it &apos;s time to upgrade the system .
And this is why we at the Bertelsmann Foundation have invested a lot of time and effort thinking about an alternative for the sector .
And we have developed the first model for a nonprofit rating agency for sovereign risk , and we call it by its acronym , INCRA .
INCRA would make a difference to the current system by adding another nonprofit player to the mix .
It would be based on a nonprofit model that would be based on a sustainable endowment .
The endowment would create income that would allow us to run the operation , to run the rating agency , and it would also allow us to make our ratings publicly available .
But this is not enough to make a difference , right ?
INCRA would also be based on a very , very clear governance structure that would avoid any conflict of interest , and it would include many stakeholders from society .
INCRA would not only be a European or an American rating agency , it would be a truly international one , in which , in particular , the emerging economies would have an equal interest , voice and representation .
If we conduct a sovereign rating , we basically take a look at the economic soil of a country , its macroeconomic fundamentals .
But we also have to ask the question , who is cultivating the economic soil of a country , right ?
Well , a country has many gardeners , and one of them is the government , so we have to ask the question , how is a country governed ?
How is it managed ?
And this is the reason why we have developed what we call forward-looking indicators .
These are indicators that give you a much better read about the socioeconomic development of a country .
I hope you would agree it &apos;s important for you to know if your government is willing to invest in renewable energy and education .
For example , if INCRA would rate South Africa right now , of course we would take a very , very close look at the youth unemployment of the country , the highest in the world .
If over 70 percent of a country &apos;s population under the age of 35 is unemployed , of course this has a huge impact on the economy today and even more so in the future .
Well , our friends at Moody &apos;s , Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s , and Fitch will tell us we would take this into account as well .
But guess what ? We do not know exactly how they will take this into account .
And this leads me to the third big difference that INCRA would make .
INCRA would not only release its ratings but it would also release its indicators and methodology .
So in contrast to the current system , INCRA would be fully transparent .
So in a nutshell , INCRA would offer an alternative to the current system of the big three rating agencies by adding a new , nonprofit player to the mix that would increase the competition , it would increase the transparency of the sector , and it would also increase the quality .
I can tell that sovereign ratings may still look to you like this very small piece of this very complex global financial world , but I tell you it &apos;s a very important one , and a very important one to fix , because sovereign ratings affect all of us , and they should be addressed and should be defined as public goods .
And this is why we are testing our model right now , and why we are trying to find out if it can bring together a group of able and willing actors to bring INCRA to life .
I truly believe building up INCRA is in everyone &apos;s interest , and that we have the unique opportunity right now to turn INCRA into a cornerstone of a new , more inclusive financial system .
Because for way too long , we have left the big financial players on their own .
It &apos;s time to give them some company .
Thank you .

I still remember the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people , and that was in 1960 .
I &apos;m going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future , but I will not use digital technology , as I &apos;ve done during my first five TEDTalks .
Instead , I have progressed , and I am , today , launching a brand new analog teaching technology that I picked up from IKEA : this box .
This box contains one billion people .
And our teacher told us that the industrialized world , 1960 , had one billion people .
In the developing world , she said , they had two billion people .
And they lived away then .
There was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world .
In the industrialized world , people were healthy , educated , rich , and they had small families .
And their aspiration was to buy a car .
And in 1960 , all Swedes were saving to try to buy a Volvo like this .
This was the economic level at which Sweden was .
But in contrast to this , in the developing world , far away , the aspiration of the average family there was to have food for the day .
They were saving to be able to buy a pair of shoes .
There was an enormous gap in the world when I grew up .
And this gap between the West and the rest has created a mindset of the world , which we still use linguistically when we talk about &quot; &quot; the West &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; the Developing World . &quot; &quot; But the world has changed , and it &apos;s overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world , and to understand it .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you , because since 1960 what has happened in the world up to 2010 is that a staggering four billion people have been added to the world population .
Just look how many .
The world population has doubled since I went to school .
And of course , there &apos;s been economic growth in the West .
A lot of companies have happened to grow the economy , so the Western population moved over to here .
And now their aspiration is not only to have a car .
Now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination and they want to fly .
So this is where they are today .
And the most successful of the developing countries , they have moved on , you know , and they have become emerging economies , we call them .
They are now buying cars .
And what happened a month ago was that the Chinese company , Geely , they acquired the Volvo company , and then finally the Swedes understood that something big had happened in the world .
( Laughter ) So there they are .
And the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes , they are still almost as poor as they were 50 years ago .
The new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions , the three billions here , which are also becoming emerging economies , because they are quite healthy , relatively well-educated , and they already also have two to three children per woman , as those &#91; richer also &#93; have .
And their aspiration now is , of course , to buy a bicycle , and then later on they would like to have a motorbike also .
But this is the world we have today , no longer any gap .
But the distance from the poorest here , the very poorest , to the very richest over here is wider than ever .
But there is a continuous world from walking , biking , driving , flying — there are people on all levels , and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle .
This is the new world we have today in 2010 .
And what will happen in the future ?
Well , I &apos;m going to project into 2050 .
I was in Shanghai recently , and I listened to what &apos;s happening in China , and it &apos;s pretty sure that they will catch up , just as Japan did .
All the projections &#91; say that &#93; this one &#91; billion &#93; will &#91; only &#93; grow with one to two or three percent .
&#91; But this second &#93; grows with seven , eight percent , and then they will end up here .
They will start flying .
And these lower or middle income countries , the emerging income countries , they will also forge forwards economically .
And if , but only if , we invest in the right green technology — so that we can avoid severe climate change , and energy can still be relatively cheap — then they will move all the way up here .
And they will start to buy electric cars .
This is what we will find there .
So what about the poorest two billion ?
What about the poorest two billion here ?
Will they move on ?
Well , here population &#91; growth &#93; comes in because there &#91; among emerging economies &#93; we already have two to three children per woman , family planning is widely used , and population growth is coming to an end .
Here &#91; among the poorest &#93; , population is growing .
So these &#91; poorest &#93; two billion will , in the next decades , increase to three billion , and they will thereafter increase to four billion .
There is nothing — but a nuclear war of a kind we &apos;ve never seen — that can stop this &#91; growth &#93; from happening .
Because we already have this &#91; growth &#93; in process .
But if , and only if , &#91; the poorest &#93; get out of poverty , they get education , they get improved child survival , they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come &#91; to live &#93; here , then population growth will stop in 2050 .
We cannot have people on this level looking for food and shoes because then we get continued population growth .
And let me show you why by converting back to the old-time digital technology .
Here I have on the screen my country bubbles .
Every bubble is a country . The size is population .
The colors show the continent .
The yellow on there is the Americas ; dark blue is Africa ; brown is Europe ; green is the Middle East and this light blue is South Asia .
That &apos;s India and this is China . Size is population .
Here I have children per woman : two children , four children , six children , eight children — big families , small families .
The year is 1960 .
And down here , child survival , the percentage of children surviving childhood up to starting school : 60 percent , 70 percent , 80 percent , 90 , and almost 100 percent , as we have today in the wealthiest and healthiest countries .
But look , this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960 : one billion Western world here — high child-survival , small families — and all the rest , the rainbow of developing countries , with very large families and poor child survival .
What has happened ? I start the world . Here we go .
Can you see , as the years pass by , child survival is increasing ?
They get soap , hygiene , education , vaccination , penicillin and then family planning . Family size is decreasing .
&#91; When &#93; they get up to 90-percent child survival , then families decrease , and most of the Arab countries in the Middle East is falling down there &#91; to small families &#93; .
Look , Bangladesh catching up with India .
The whole emerging world joins the Western world with good child survival and small family size , but we still have the poorest billion .
Can you see the poorest billion , those &#91; two &#93; boxes I had over here ?
They are still up here .
And they still have a child survival of only 70 to 80 percent , meaning that if you have six children born , there will be at least four who survive to the next generation .
And the population will double in one generation .
So the only way of really getting world population &#91; growth &#93; to stop is to continue to improve child survival to 90 percent .
That &apos;s why investments by Gates Foundation , UNICEF and aid organizations , together with national government in the poorest countries , are so good ; because they are actually helping us to reach a sustainable population size of the world .
We can stop at nine billion if we do the right things .
Child survival is the new green .
It &apos;s only by child survival that we will stop population growth .
And will it happen ?
Well , I &apos;m not an optimist , neither am I a pessimist .
I &apos;m a very serious &quot; &quot; possibilist . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a new category where we take emotion apart , and we just work analytically with the world .
It can be done .
We can have a much more just world .
With green technology and with investments to alleviate poverty , and global governance , the world can become like this .
And look at the position of the old West .
Remember when this blue box was all alone , leading the world , living its own life .
This will not happen &#91; again &#93; .
The role of the old West in the new world is to become the foundation of the modern world — nothing more , nothing less .
But it &apos;s a very important role .
Do it well and get used to it .
Thank you very much .

This is the Large Hadron Collider .
It &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference .
It &apos;s the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted .
Over 10,000 physicists and engineers from 85 countries around the world have come together over several decades to build this machine .
What we do is we accelerate protons — so , hydrogen nuclei — around 99.999999 percent the speed of light .
Right ? At that speed , they go around that 27 kilometers 11,000 times a second .
And we collide them with another beam of protons going in the opposite direction .
We collide them inside giant detectors .
They &apos;re essentially digital cameras .
And this is the one that I work on , ATLAS .
You get some sense of the size — you can just see these EU standard-size people underneath .
( Laughter ) You get some sense of the size : 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter , 7,000 tons .
And we re-create the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began up to 600 million times a second inside that detector — immense numbers .
And if you see those metal bits there — those are huge magnets that bend electrically charged particles , so it can measure how fast they &apos;re traveling .
This is a picture about a year ago .
Those magnets are in there .
And , again , a EU standard-size , real person , so you get some sense of the scale .
And it &apos;s in there that those mini-Big Bangs will be created , sometime in the summer this year .
And actually , this morning , I got an email saying that we &apos;ve just finished , today , building the last piece of ATLAS .
So as of today , it &apos;s finished . I &apos;d like to say that I planned that for TED , but I didn &apos;t . So it &apos;s been completed as of today .
( Applause ) Yeah , it &apos;s a wonderful achievement .
So , you might be asking , &quot; &quot; Why ?
Why create the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began ? &quot; &quot; Well , particle physicists are nothing if not ambitious .
And the aim of particle physics is to understand what everything &apos;s made of , and how everything sticks together .
And by everything I mean , of course , me and you , the Earth , the Sun , the 100 billion suns in our galaxy and the 100 billion galaxies in the observable universe .
Absolutely everything .
Now you might say , &quot; &quot; Well , OK , but why not just look at it ?
You know ? If you want to know what I &apos;m made of , let &apos;s look at me . &quot; &quot; Well , we found that as you look back in time , the universe gets hotter and hotter , denser and denser , and simpler and simpler .
Now , there &apos;s no real reason I &apos;m aware of for that , but that seems to be the case .
So , way back in the early times of the universe , we believe it was very simple and understandable .
All this complexity , all the way to these wonderful things — human brains — are a property of an old and cold and complicated universe .
Back at the start , in the first billionth of a second , we believe , or we &apos;ve observed , it was very simple .
It &apos;s almost like ...
imagine a snowflake in your hand , and you look at it , and it &apos;s an incredibly complicated , beautiful object . But as you heat it up , it &apos;ll melt into a pool of water , and you would be able to see that , actually , it was just made of H20 , water .
So it &apos;s in that same sense that we look back in time to understand what the universe is made of .
And , as of today , it &apos;s made of these things .
Just 12 particles of matter , stuck together by four forces of nature .
The quarks , these pink things , are the things that make up protons and neutrons that make up the atomic nuclei in your body .
The electron — the thing that goes around the atomic nucleus — held around in orbit , by the way , by the electromagnetic force that &apos;s carried by this thing , the photon .
The quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons .
And these guys , here , they &apos;re the weak nuclear force , probably the least familiar .
But , without it , the sun wouldn &apos;t shine .
And when the sun shines , you get copious quantities of these things , called neutrinos , pouring out .
Actually , if you just look at your thumbnail — about a square centimeter — there are something like 60 billion neutrinos per second from the sun , passing through every square centimeter of your body .
But you don &apos;t feel them , because the weak force is correctly named — very short range and very weak , so they just fly through you .
And these particles have been discovered over the last century , pretty much .
The first one , the electron , was discovered in 1897 , and the last one , this thing called the tau neutrino , in the year 2000 . Actually just — I was going to say , just up the road in Chicago . I know it &apos;s a big country , America , isn &apos;t it ?
Just up the road .
Relative to the universe , it &apos;s just up the road .
( Laughter ) So , this thing was discovered in the year 2000 , so it &apos;s a relatively recent picture .
One of the wonderful things , actually , I find , is that we &apos;ve discovered any of them , when you realize how tiny they are .
You know , they &apos;re a step in size from the entire observable universe .
So , 100 billion galaxies , 13.7 billion light years away — a step in size from that to Monterey , actually , is about the same as from Monterey to these things .
Absolutely , exquisitely minute , and yet we &apos;ve discovered pretty much the full set .
So , one of my most illustrious forebears at Manchester University , Ernest Rutherford , discoverer of the atomic nucleus , once said , &quot; &quot; All science is either physics or stamp collecting . &quot; &quot; Now , I don &apos;t think he meant to insult the rest of science , although he was from New Zealand , so it &apos;s possible .
( Laughter ) But what he meant was that what we &apos;ve done , really , is stamp collect there .
OK , we &apos;ve discovered the particles , but unless you understand the underlying reason for that pattern — you know , why it &apos;s built the way it is — really you &apos;ve done stamp collecting . You haven &apos;t done science .
Fortunately , we have probably one of the greatest scientific achievements of the twentieth century that underpins that pattern .
It &apos;s the Newton &apos;s laws , if you want , of particle physics .
It &apos;s called the standard model — beautifully simple mathematical equation .
You could stick it on the front of a T-shirt , which is always the sign of elegance .
This is it .
( Laughter ) I &apos;ve been a little disingenuous , because I &apos;ve expanded it out in all its gory detail .
This equation , though , allows you to calculate everything — other than gravity — that happens in the universe .
So , you want to know why the sky is blue , why atomic nuclei stick together — in principle , you &apos;ve got a big enough computer — why DNA is the shape it is .
In principle , you should be able to calculate it from that equation .
But there &apos;s a problem .
Can anyone see what it is ?
A bottle of champagne for anyone that tells me .
I &apos;ll make it easier , actually , by blowing one of the lines up .
Basically , each of these terms refers to some of the particles .
So those Ws there refer to the Ws , and how they stick together .
These carriers of the weak force , the Zs , the same .
But there &apos;s an extra symbol in this equation : H.
Right , H.
H stands for Higgs particle .
Higgs particles have not been discovered .
But they &apos;re necessary : they &apos;re necessary to make that mathematics work .
So all the exquisitely detailed calculations we can do with that wonderful equation wouldn &apos;t be possible without an extra bit .
So it &apos;s a prediction : a prediction of a new particle .
What does it do ?
Well , we had a long time to come up with good analogies .
And back in the 1980s , when we wanted the money for the LHC from the U.K. government , Margaret Thatcher , at the time , said , &quot; &quot; If you guys can explain , in language a politician can understand , what the hell it is that you &apos;re doing , you can have the money .
I want to know what this Higgs particle does . &quot; &quot; And we came up with this analogy , and it seemed to work .
Well , what the Higgs does is , it gives mass to the fundamental particles .
And the picture is that the whole universe — and that doesn &apos;t mean just space , it means me as well , and inside you — the whole universe is full of something called a Higgs field .
Higgs particles , if you will .
The analogy is that these people in a room are the Higgs particles .
Now when a particle moves through the universe , it can interact with these Higgs particles .
But imagine someone who &apos;s not very popular moves through the room .
Then everyone ignores them . They can just pass through the room very quickly , essentially at the speed of light . They &apos;re massless .
And imagine someone incredibly important and popular and intelligent walks into the room .
They &apos;re surrounded by people , and their passage through the room is impeded .
It &apos;s almost like they get heavy . They get massive .
And that &apos;s exactly the way the Higgs mechanism works .
The picture is that the electrons and the quarks in your body and in the universe that we see around us are heavy , in a sense , and massive , because they &apos;re surrounded by Higgs particles .
They &apos;re interacting with the Higgs field .
If that picture &apos;s true , then we have to discover those Higgs particles at the LHC .
If it &apos;s not true — because it &apos;s quite a convoluted mechanism , although it &apos;s the simplest we &apos;ve been able to think of — then whatever does the job of the Higgs particles we know have to turn up at the LHC .
So , that &apos;s one of the prime reasons we built this giant machine .
I &apos;m glad you recognize Margaret Thatcher .
Actually , I thought about making it more culturally relevant , but — ( Laughter ) anyway .
So that &apos;s one thing .
That &apos;s essentially a guarantee of what the LHC will find .
There are many other things . You &apos;ve heard many of the big problems in particle physics .
One of them you heard about : dark matter , dark energy .
There &apos;s another issue , which is that the forces in nature — it &apos;s quite beautiful , actually — seem , as you go back in time , they seem to change in strength .
Well , they do change in strength .
So , the electromagnetic force , the force that holds us together , gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures .
The strong force , the strong nuclear force , which sticks nuclei together , gets weaker . And what you see is the standard model — you can calculate how these change — is the forces , the three forces , other than gravity , almost seem to come together at one point .
It &apos;s almost as if there was one beautiful kind of super-force , back at the beginning of time .
But they just miss .
Now there &apos;s a theory called super-symmetry , which doubles the number of particles in the standard model , which , at first sight , doesn &apos;t sound like a simplification .
But actually , with this theory , we find that the forces of nature do seem to unify together , back at the Big Bang — absolutely beautiful prophecy . The model wasn &apos;t built to do that , but it seems to do it .
Also , those super-symmetric particles are very strong candidates for the dark matter .
So a very compelling theory that &apos;s really mainstream physics .
And if I was to put money on it , I would put money on — in a very unscientific way — that that these things would also crop up at the LHC .
Many other things that the LHC could discover .
But in the last few minutes , I just want to give you a different perspective of what I think — what particle physics really means to me — particle physics and cosmology .
And that &apos;s that I think it &apos;s given us a wonderful narrative — almost a creation story , if you &apos;d like — about the universe , from modern science over the last few decades .
And I &apos;d say that it deserves , in the spirit of Wade Davis &apos; talk , to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories of the peoples of the high Andes and the frozen north .
This is a creation story , I think , equally as wonderful .
The story goes like this : we know that the universe began 13.7 billion years ago , in an immensely hot , dense state , much smaller than a single atom .
It began to expand about a million , billion , billion , billion billionth of a second — I think I got that right — after the Big Bang .
Gravity separated away from the other forces .
The universe then underwent an exponential expansion called inflation .
In about the first billionth of a second or so , the Higgs field kicked in , and the quarks and the gluons and the electrons that make us up got mass .
The universe continued to expand and cool .
After about a few minutes , there was hydrogen and helium in the universe . That &apos;s all .
The universe was about 75 percent hydrogen , 25 percent helium . It still is today .
It continued to expand about 300 million years .
Then light began to travel through the universe .
It was big enough to be transparent to light , and that &apos;s what we see in the cosmic microwave background that George Smoot described as looking at the face of God .
After about 400 million years , the first stars formed , and that hydrogen , that helium , then began to cook into the heavier elements .
So the elements of life — carbon , and oxygen and iron , all the elements that we need to make us up — were cooked in those first generations of stars , which then ran out of fuel , exploded , threw those elements back into the universe .
They then re-collapsed into another generation of stars and planets .
And on some of those planets , the oxygen , which had been created in that first generation of stars , could fuse with hydrogen to form water , liquid water on the surface .
On at least one , and maybe only one of those planets , primitive life evolved , which evolved over millions of years into things that walked upright and left footprints about three and a half million years ago in the mud flats of Tanzania , and eventually left a footprint on another world .
And built this civilization , this wonderful picture , that turned the darkness into light , and you can see the civilization from space .
As one of my great heroes , Carl Sagan , said , these are the things — and actually , not only these , but I was looking around — these are the things , like Saturn V rockets , and Sputnik , and DNA , and literature and science — these are the things that hydrogen atoms do when given 13.7 billion years .
Absolutely remarkable .
And , the laws of physics . Right ?
So , the right laws of physics — they &apos;re beautifully balanced .
If the weak force had been a little bit different , then carbon and oxygen wouldn &apos;t be stable inside the hearts of stars , and there would be none of that in the universe .
And I think that &apos;s a wonderful and significant story .
50 years ago , I couldn &apos;t have told that story , because we didn &apos;t know it .
It makes me really feel that that civilization — which , as I say , if you believe the scientific creation story , has emerged purely as a result of the laws of physics , and a few hydrogen atoms — then I think , to me anyway , it makes me feel incredibly valuable .
So that &apos;s the LHC .
The LHC is certainly , when it turns on in summer , going to write the next chapter of that book .
And I &apos;m certainly looking forward with immense excitement to it being turned on .
Thanks .

Suppose that two American friends are traveling together in Italy .
They go to see Michelangelo &apos;s &quot; &quot; David , &quot; &quot; and when they finally come face to face with the statue , they both freeze dead in their tracks .
The first guy — we &apos;ll call him Adam — is transfixed by the beauty of the perfect human form .
The second guy — we &apos;ll call him Bill — is transfixed by embarrassment , at staring at the thing there in the center .
So here &apos;s my question for you : which one of these two guys was more likely to have voted for George Bush , which for Al Gore ?
I don &apos;t need a show of hands because we all have the same political stereotypes .
We all know that it &apos;s Bill .
And in this case , the stereotype corresponds to reality .
It really is a fact that liberals are much higher than conservatives on a major personality trait called openness to experience .
People who are high in openness to experience just crave novelty , variety , diversity , new ideas , travel .
People low on it like things that are familiar , that are safe and dependable .
If you know about this trait , you can understand a lot of puzzles about human behavior .
You can understand why artists are so different from accountants .
You can actually predict what kinds of books they like to read , what kinds of places they like to travel to , and what kinds of food they like to eat .
Once you understand this trait , you can understand why anybody would eat at Applebee &apos;s , but not anybody that you know .
( Laughter ) This trait also tells us a lot about politics .
The main researcher of this trait , Robert McCrae says that , &quot; &quot; Open individuals have an affinity for liberal , progressive , left-wing political views &quot; &quot; — they like a society which is open and changing — &quot; whereas closed individuals prefer conservative , traditional , right-wing views . &quot;
This trait also tells us a lot about the kinds of groups people join .
So here &apos;s the description of a group I found on the Web .
What kinds of people would join a global community welcoming people from every discipline and culture , who seek a deeper understanding of the world , and who hope to turn that understanding into a better future for us all ?
This is from some guy named Ted .
( Laughter ) Well , let &apos;s see now , if openness predicts who becomes liberal , and openness predicts who becomes a TEDster , then might we predict that most TEDsters are liberal ?
Let &apos;s find out .
I &apos;m going to ask you to raise your hand , whether you are liberal , left of center — on social issues , we &apos;re talking about , primarily — or conservative , and I &apos;ll give a third option , because I know there are a number of libertarians in the audience .
So , right now , please raise your hand — down in the simulcast rooms , too , let &apos;s let everybody see who &apos;s here — please raise your hand if you would say that you are liberal or left of center .
Please raise your hand high right now . OK .
Please raise your hand if you &apos;d say you &apos;re libertarian .
OK , about a — two dozen .
And please raise your hand if you &apos;d say you are right of center or conservative .
One , two , three , four , five — about eight or 10 .
OK . This is a bit of a problem .
Because if our goal is to understand the world , to seek a deeper understanding of the world , our general lack of moral diversity here is going to make it harder .
Because when people all share values , when people all share morals , they become a team , and once you engage the psychology of teams , it shuts down open-minded thinking .
When the liberal team loses , as it did in 2004 , and as it almost did in 2000 , we comfort ourselves .
( Laughter ) We try to explain why half of America voted for the other team .
We think they must be blinded by religion , or by simple stupidity .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So , if you think that half of America votes Republican because they are blinded in this way , then my message to you is that you &apos;re trapped in a moral matrix , in a particular moral matrix .
And by the matrix , I mean literally the matrix , like the movie &quot; &quot; The Matrix . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m here today to give you a choice .
You can either take the blue pill and stick to your comforting delusions , or you can take the red pill , learn some moral psychology and step outside the moral matrix .
Now , because I know — ( Applause ) — OK , I assume that answers my question .
I was going to ask you which one you picked , but no need .
You &apos;re all high in openness to experience , and besides , it looks like it might even taste good , and you &apos;re all epicures .
So anyway , let &apos;s go with the red pill .
Let &apos;s study some moral psychology and see where it takes us .
Let &apos;s start at the beginning .
What is morality and where does it come from ?
The worst idea in all of psychology is the idea that the mind is a blank slate at birth .
Developmental psychology has shown that kids come into the world already knowing so much about the physical and social worlds , and programmed to make it really easy for them to learn certain things and hard to learn others .
The best definition of innateness I &apos;ve ever seen — this just clarifies so many things for me — is from the brain scientist Gary Marcus .
He says , &quot; &quot; The initial organization of the brain does not depend that much on experience .
Nature provides a first draft , which experience then revises .
Built-in doesn &apos;t mean unmalleable ; it means organized in advance of experience . &quot; &quot; OK , so what &apos;s on the first draft of the moral mind ?
To find out , my colleague , Craig Joseph , and I read through the literature on anthropology , on culture variation in morality and also on evolutionary psychology , looking for matches .
What are the sorts of things that people talk about across disciplines ?
That you find across cultures and even across species ?
We found five — five best matches , which we call the five foundations of morality .
The first one is harm / care .
We &apos;re all mammals here , we all have a lot of neural and hormonal programming that makes us really bond with others , care for others , feel compassion for others , especially the weak and vulnerable .
It gives us very strong feelings about those who cause harm .
This moral foundation underlies about 70 percent of the moral statements I &apos;ve heard here at TED .
The second foundation is fairness / reciprocity .
There &apos;s actually ambiguous evidence as to whether you find reciprocity in other animals , but the evidence for people could not be clearer .
This Norman Rockwell painting is called &quot; &quot; The Golden Rule , &quot; &quot; and we heard about this from Karen Armstrong , of course , as the foundation of so many religions .
That second foundation underlies the other 30 percent of the moral statements I &apos;ve heard here at TED .
The third foundation is in-group / loyalty .
You do find groups in the animal kingdom — you do find cooperative groups — but these groups are always either very small or they &apos;re all siblings .
It &apos;s only among humans that you find very large groups of people who are able to cooperate , join together into groups , but in this case , groups that are united to fight other groups .
This probably comes from our long history of tribal living , of tribal psychology .
And this tribal psychology is so deeply pleasurable that even when we don &apos;t have tribes , we go ahead and make them , because it &apos;s fun .
( Laughter ) Sports is to war as pornography is to sex .
We get to exercise some ancient , ancient drives .
The fourth foundation is authority / respect .
Here you see submissive gestures from two members of very closely related species .
But authority in humans is not so closely based on power and brutality , as it is in other primates .
It &apos;s based on more voluntary deference , and even elements of love , at times .
The fifth foundation is purity / sanctity .
This painting is called &quot; &quot; The Allegory Of Chastity , &quot; &quot; but purity &apos;s not just about suppressing female sexuality .
It &apos;s about any kind of ideology , any kind of idea that tells you that you can attain virtue by controlling what you do with your body , by controlling what you put into your body .
And while the political right may moralize sex much more , the political left is really doing a lot of it with food .
Food is becoming extremely moralized nowadays , and a lot of it is ideas about purity , about what you &apos;re willing to touch , or put into your body .
I believe these are the five best candidates for what &apos;s written on the first draft of the moral mind .
I think this is what we come with , at least a preparedness to learn all of these things .
But as my son , Max , grows up in a liberal college town , how is this first draft going to get revised ?
And how will it end up being different from a kid born 60 miles south of us in Lynchburg , Virginia ?
To think about culture variation , let &apos;s try a different metaphor .
If there really are five systems at work in the mind — five sources of intuitions and emotions — then we can think of the moral mind as being like one of those audio equalizers that has five channels , where you can set it to a different setting on every channel .
And my colleagues , Brian Nosek and Jesse Graham , and I , made a questionnaire , which we put up on the Web at www.YourMorals.org.
And so far , 30,000 people have taken this questionnaire , and you can too .
Here are the results .
Here are the results from about 23,000 American citizens .
On the left , I &apos;ve plotted the scores for liberals ; on the right , those for conservatives ; in the middle , the moderates .
The blue line shows you people &apos;s responses on the average of all the harm questions .
So , as you see , people care about harm and care issues .
They give high endorsement of these sorts of statements all across the board , but as you also see , liberals care about it a little more than conservatives — the line slopes down .
Same story for fairness .
But look at the other three lines .
For liberals , the scores are very low .
Liberals are basically saying , &quot; &quot; No , this is not morality .
In-group , authority , purity — this stuff has nothing to do with morality . I reject it . &quot; &quot; But as people get more conservative , the values rise .
We can say that liberals have a kind of a two-channel , or two-foundation morality .
Conservatives have more of a five-foundation , or five-channel morality .
We find this in every country we look at .
Here &apos;s the data for 1,100 Canadians .
I &apos;ll just flip through a few other slides .
The U.K. , Australia , New Zealand , Western Europe , Eastern Europe , Latin America , the Middle East , East Asia and South Asia .
Notice also that on all of these graphs , the slope is steeper on in-group , authority , purity .
Which shows that within any country , the disagreement isn &apos;t over harm and fairness .
Everybody — I mean , we debate over what &apos;s fair — but everybody agrees that harm and fairness matter .
Moral arguments within cultures are especially about issues of in-group , authority , purity .
This effect is so robust that we find it no matter how we ask the question .
In one recent study , we asked people to suppose you &apos;re about to get a dog .
You picked a particular breed , you learned some new information about the breed .
Suppose you learn that this particular breed is independent-minded , and relates to its owner as a friend and an equal ?
Well , if you are a liberal , you say , &quot; &quot; Hey , that &apos;s great ! &quot; &quot; Because liberals like to say , &quot; &quot; Fetch , please . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But if you &apos;re conservative , that &apos;s not so attractive .
If you &apos;re conservative , and you learn that a dog &apos;s extremely loyal to its home and family , and doesn &apos;t warm up quickly to strangers , for conservatives , well , loyalty is good — dogs ought to be loyal .
But to a liberal , it sounds like this dog is running for the Republican nomination .
( Laughter ) So , you might say , OK , there are these differences between liberals and conservatives , but what makes those three other foundations moral ?
Aren &apos;t those just the foundations of xenophobia and authoritarianism and Puritanism ?
What makes them moral ?
The answer , I think , is contained in this incredible triptych from Hieronymus Bosch , &quot; The Garden of Earthly Delights . &quot;
In the first panel , we see the moment of creation .
All is ordered , all is beautiful , all the people and animals are doing what they &apos;re supposed to be doing , where they &apos;re supposed to be .
But then , given the way of the world , things change .
We get every person doing whatever he wants , with every aperture of every other person and every other animal .
Some of you might recognize this as the &apos; 60s .
( Laughter ) But the &apos; 60s inevitably gives way to the &apos; 70s , where the cuttings of the apertures hurt a little bit more .
Of course , Bosch called this hell .
So this triptych , these three panels portray the timeless truth that order tends to decay .
The truth of social entropy .
But lest you think this is just some part of the Christian imagination where Christians have this weird problem with pleasure , here &apos;s the same story , the same progression , told in a paper that was published in Nature a few years ago , in which Ernst Fehr and Simon Gachter had people play a commons dilemma .
A game in which you give people money , and then , on each round of the game , they can put money into a common pot , and then the experimenter doubles what &apos;s in there , and then it &apos;s all divided among the players .
So it &apos;s a really nice analog for all sorts of environmental issues , where we &apos;re asking people to make a sacrifice and they themselves don &apos;t really benefit from their own sacrifice .
But you really want everybody else to sacrifice , but everybody has a temptation to a free ride .
And what happens is that , at first , people start off reasonably cooperative — and this is all played anonymously .
On the first round , people give about half of the money that they can .
But they quickly see , &quot; &quot; You know what , other people aren &apos;t doing so much though .
I don &apos;t want to be a sucker . I &apos;m not going to cooperate . &quot; &quot; And so cooperation quickly decays from reasonably good , down to close to zero .
But then — and here &apos;s the trick — Fehr and Gachter said , on the seventh round , they told people , &quot; &quot; You know what ? New rule .
If you want to give some of your own money to punish people who aren &apos;t contributing , you can do that . &quot; &quot; And as soon as people heard about the punishment issue going on , cooperation shoots up .
It shoots up and it keeps going up .
There &apos;s a lot of research showing that to solve cooperative problems , it really helps .
It &apos;s not enough to just appeal to people &apos;s good motives .
It really helps to have some sort of punishment .
Even if it &apos;s just shame or embarrassment or gossip , you need some sort of punishment to bring people , when they &apos;re in large groups , to cooperate .
There &apos;s even some recent research suggesting that religion — priming God , making people think about God — often , in some situations , leads to more cooperative , more pro-social behavior .
Some people think that religion is an adaptation evolved both by cultural and biological evolution to make groups to cohere , in part for the purpose of trusting each other , and then being more effective at competing with other groups .
I think that &apos;s probably right , although this is a controversial issue .
But I &apos;m particularly interested in religion , and the origin of religion , and in what it does to us and for us .
Because I think that the greatest wonder in the world is not the Grand Canyon .
The Grand Canyon is really simple .
It &apos;s just a lot of rock , and then a lot of water and wind , and a lot of time , and you get the Grand Canyon .
It &apos;s not that complicated .
This is what &apos;s really complicated , that there were people living in places like the Grand Canyon , cooperating with each other , or on the savannahs of Africa , or on the frozen shores of Alaska , and then some of these villages grew into the mighty cities of Babylon , and Rome , and Tenochtitlan .
How did this happen ?
This is an absolute miracle , much harder to explain than the Grand Canyon .
The answer , I think , is that they used every tool in the toolbox .
It took all of our moral psychology to create these cooperative groups .
Yes , you do need to be concerned about harm , you do need a psychology of justice .
But it really helps to organize a group if you can have sub-groups , and if those sub-groups have some internal structure , and if you have some ideology that tells people to suppress their carnality , to pursue higher , nobler ends .
And now we get to the crux of the disagreement between liberals and conservatives .
Because liberals reject three of these foundations .
They say &quot; &quot; No , let &apos;s celebrate diversity , not common in-group membership . &quot; &quot; They say , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s question authority . &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Keep your laws off my body . &quot; &quot; Liberals have very noble motives for doing this .
Traditional authority , traditional morality can be quite repressive , and restrictive to those at the bottom , to women , to people that don &apos;t fit in .
So liberals speak for the weak and oppressed .
They want change and justice , even at the risk of chaos .
This guy &apos;s shirt says , &quot; &quot; Stop bitching , start a revolution . &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re high in openness to experience , revolution is good , it &apos;s change , it &apos;s fun .
Conservatives , on the other hand , speak for institutions and traditions .
They want order , even at some cost to those at the bottom .
The great conservative insight is that order is really hard to achieve .
It &apos;s really precious , and it &apos;s really easy to lose .
So as Edmund Burke said , &quot; &quot; The restraints on men , as well as their liberties , are to be reckoned among their rights . &quot; &quot; This was after the chaos of the French Revolution .
So once you see this — once you see that liberals and conservatives both have something to contribute , that they form a balance on change versus stability — then I think the way is open to step outside the moral matrix .
This is the great insight that all the Asian religions have attained .
Think about yin and yang .
Yin and yang aren &apos;t enemies . Yin and yang don &apos;t hate each other .
Yin and yang are both necessary , like night and day , for the functioning of the world .
You find the same thing in Hinduism .
There are many high gods in Hinduism .
Two of them are Vishnu , the preserver , and Shiva , the destroyer .
This image actually is both of those gods sharing the same body .
You have the markings of Vishnu on the left , so we could think of Vishnu as the conservative god .
You have the markings of Shiva on the right , Shiva &apos;s the liberal god . And they work together .
You find the same thing in Buddhism .
These two stanzas contain , I think , the deepest insights that have ever been attained into moral psychology .
From the Zen master Seng-ts &apos;an : &quot; &quot; If you want the truth to stand clear before you , never be for or against .
The struggle between for and against is the mind &apos;s worst disease . &quot; &quot; Now unfortunately , it &apos;s a disease that has been caught by many of the world &apos;s leaders .
But before you feel superior to George Bush , before you throw a stone , ask yourself , do you accept this ?
Do you accept stepping out of the battle of good and evil ?
Can you be not for or against anything ?
So , what &apos;s the point ? What should you do ?
Well , if you take the greatest insights from ancient Asian philosophies and religions , and you combine them with the latest research on moral psychology , I think you come to these conclusions : that our righteous minds were designed by evolution to unite us into teams , to divide us against other teams and then to blind us to the truth .
So what should you do ? Am I telling you to not strive ?
Am I telling you to embrace Seng-ts &apos;an and stop , stop with this struggle of for and against ?
No , absolutely not . I &apos;m not saying that .
This is an amazing group of people who are doing so much , using so much of their talent , their brilliance , their energy , their money , to make the world a better place , to fight — to fight wrongs , to solve problems .
But as we learned from Samantha Power , in her story about Sergio Vieira de Mello , you can &apos;t just go charging in , saying , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re wrong , and I &apos;m right . &quot; &quot; Because , as we just heard , everybody thinks they are right .
A lot of the problems we have to solve are problems that require us to change other people .
And if you want to change other people , a much better way to do it is to first understand who we are — understand our moral psychology , understand that we all think we &apos;re right — and then step out , even if it &apos;s just for a moment , step out — check in with Seng-ts &apos;an .
Step out of the moral matrix , just try to see it as a struggle playing out , in which everybody does think they &apos;re right , and everybody , at least , has some reasons — even if you disagree with them — everybody has some reasons for what they &apos;re doing .
Step out .
And if you do that , that &apos;s the essential move to cultivate moral humility , to get yourself out of this self-righteousness , which is the normal human condition .
Think about the Dalai Lama .
Think about the enormous moral authority of the Dalai Lama — and it comes from his moral humility .
So I think the point — the point of my talk , and I think the point of TED — is that this is a group that is passionately engaged in the pursuit of changing the world for the better .
People here are passionately engaged in trying to make the world a better place .
But there is also a passionate commitment to the truth .
And so I think that the answer is to use that passionate commitment to the truth to try to turn it into a better future for us all .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Is there anything unique about human beings ?
There is .
We &apos;re the only creatures with fully developed moral sentiments .
We &apos;re obsessed with morality as social creatures .
We need to know why people are doing what they &apos;re doing .
And I personally am obsessed with morality .
It was all due to this woman , Sister Mary Marastela , also known as my mom .
As an altar boy , I breathed in a lot of incense , and I learned to say phrases in Latin , but I also had time to think about whether my mother &apos;s top-down morality applied to everybody .
I saw that people who were religious and non-religious were equally obsessed with morality .
I thought , maybe there &apos;s some earthly basis for moral decisions .
But I wanted to go further than to say our brains make us moral .
I want to know if there &apos;s a chemistry of morality . I want to know
if there was a moral molecule .
After 10 years of experiments , I found it .
Would you like to see it ? I brought some with me .
This little syringe contains the moral molecule .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s called oxytocin .
So oxytocin is a simple and ancient molecule found only in mammals .
In rodents , it was known to make mothers care for their offspring , and in some creatures , allowed for toleration of burrowmates .
But in humans , it was only known to facilitate birth and breastfeeding in women , and is released by both sexes during sex .
So I had this idea that oxytocin might be the moral molecule .
I did what most of us do — I tried it on some colleagues .
One of them told me , &quot; &quot; Paul , that is the world &apos;s stupidist idea .
It is , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; only a female molecule .
It can &apos;t be that important . &quot; &quot; But I countered , &quot; &quot; Well men &apos;s brains make this too .
There must be a reason why . &quot; &quot; But he was right , it was a stupid idea .
But it was testably stupid .
In other words , I thought I could design an experiment to see if oxytocin made people moral .
Turns out it wasn &apos;t so easy .
First of all , oxytocin is a shy molecule .
Baseline levels are near zero , without some stimulus to cause its release .
And when it &apos;s produced , it has a three-minute half-life , and degrades rapidly at room temperature .
So this experiment would have to cause a surge of oxytocin , have to grab it fast and keep it cold .
I think I can do that .
Now luckily , oxytocin is produced both in the brain and in the blood , so I could do this experiment without learning neurosurgery .
Then I had to measure morality .
So taking on Morality with a capital M is a huge project .
So I started smaller .
I studied one single virtue : trustworthiness .
Why ? I had shown in the early 2000s that countries with a higher proportion of trustworthy people are more prosperous .
So in these countries , more economic transactions occur and more wealth is created , alleviating poverty .
So poor countries are by and large low trust countries .
So if I understood the chemistry of trustworthiness , I might help alleviate poverty .
But I &apos;m also a skeptic .
I don &apos;t want to just ask people , &quot; &quot; Are you trustworthy ? &quot; &quot; So instead I use the Jerry Maguire approach to research .
If you &apos;re so virtuous , show me the money .
So what we do in my lab is we tempt people with virtue and vice by using money .
Let me show you how we do that .
So we recruit some people for an experiment .
They all get $ 10 if they agree to show up .
We give them lots of instruction , and we never ever deceive them .
Then we match them in pairs by computer .
And in that pair , one person gets a message saying , &quot; &quot; Do you want to give up some of your $ 10 you earned for being here and ship it to someone else in the lab ? &quot; &quot; The trick is you can &apos;t see them , you can &apos;t talk to them .
You only do it one time .
Now whatever you give up gets tripled in the other person &apos;s account .
You &apos;re going to make them a lot wealthier .
And they get a message by computer saying person one sent you this amount of money .
Do you want to keep it all , or do you want to send some amount back ?
So think about this experiment for minute .
You &apos;re going to sit on these hard chairs for an hour and a half .
Some mad scientist is going to jab your arm with a needle and take four tubes of blood .
And now you want me to give up this money and ship it to a stranger ?
So this was the birth of vampire economics .
Make a decision and give me some blood .
So in fact , experimental economists had run this test around the world , and for much higher stakes , and the consensus view was that the measure from the first person to the second was a measure of trust , and the transfer from the second person back to the first measured trustworthiness .
But in fact , economists were flummoxed on why the second person would ever return any money .
They assumed money is good , why not keep it all ?
That &apos;s not what we found .
We found 90 percent of the first decision-makers sent money , and of those who received money , 95 percent returned some of it .
But why ?
Well by measuring oxytocin we found that the more money the second person received , the more their brain produced oxytocin , and the more oxytocin on board , the more money they returned .
So we have a biology of trustworthiness .
But wait . What &apos;s wrong with this experiment ?
Two things .
One is that nothing in the body happens in isolation .
So we measured nine other molecules that interact with oxytocin , but they didn &apos;t have any effect .
But the second is that I still only had this indirect relationship between oxytocin and trustworthiness .
I didn &apos;t know for sure oxytocin caused trustworthiness .
So to make the experiment , I knew I &apos;d have to go into the brain and manipulate oxytocin directly .
I used everything short of a drill to get oxytocin into my own brain .
And I found I could do it with a nasal inhaler .
So along with colleagues in Zurich , we put 200 men on oxytocin or placebo , had that same trust test with money , and we found that those on oxytocin not only showed more trust , we can more than double the number of people who sent all their money to a stranger — all without altering mood or cognition .
So oxytocin is the trust molecule , but is it the moral molecule ?
Using the oxytocin inhaler , we ran more studies .
We showed that oxytocin infusion increases generosity in unilateral monetary transfers by 80 percent .
We showed it increases donations to charity by 50 percent .
We &apos;ve also investigated non-pharmacologic ways to raise oxytocin .
These include massage , dancing and praying .
Yes , my mom was happy about that last one .
And whenever we raise oxytocin , people willingly open up their wallets and share money with strangers .
But why do they do this ?
What does it feel like when your brain is flooded with oxytocin ?
To investigate this question , we ran an experiment where we had people watch a video of a father and his four year-old son , and his son has terminal brain cancer .
After they watched the video , we had them rate their feelings and took blood before and after to measure oxytocin .
The change in oxytocin predicted their feelings of empathy .
So it &apos;s empathy that makes us connect to other people .
It &apos;s empathy that makes us help other people .
It &apos;s empathy that makes us moral .
Now this idea is not new .
A then unknown philosopher named Adam Smith wrote a book in 1759 called &quot; &quot; The Theory of Moral Sentiments . &quot; &quot; In this book , Smith argued that we are moral creatures , not because of a top-down reason , but for a bottom-up reason .
He said we &apos;re social creatures , so we share the emotions of others .
So if I do something that hurts you , I feel that pain .
So I tend to avoid that .
If I do something that makes you happy , I get to share your joy .
So I tend to do those things .
Now this is the same Adam Smith who , 17 years later , would write a little book called &quot; &quot; The Wealth of Nations &quot; &quot; — the founding document of economics .
But he was , in fact , a moral philosopher , and he was right on why we &apos;re moral .
I just found the molecule behind it .
But knowing that molecule is valuable , because it tells us how to turn up this behavior and what turns it off .
In particular , it tells us why we see immorality .
So to investigate immorality , let me bring you back now to 1980 .
I &apos;m working at a gas station on the outskirts of Santa Barbara , California .
You sit in a gas station all day , you see lots of morality and immorality , let me tell you .
So one Sunday afternoon , a man walks into my cashier &apos;s booth with this beautiful jewelry box .
Opens it up and there &apos;s a pearl necklace inside .
And he said , &quot; &quot; Hey , I was in the men &apos;s room .
I just found this . What do you think we should do with it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , put it in the lost and found . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Well this is very valuable .
We have to find the owner for this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yea . &quot; &quot; So we &apos;re trying to decide what to do with this , and the phone rings .
And a man says very excitedly , &quot; &quot; I was in your gas station a while ago , and I bought this jewelry for my wife , and I can &apos;t find it . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Pearl necklace ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; &quot; Hey , a guy just found it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Oh , you &apos;re saving my life . Here &apos;s my phone number .
Tell that guy to wait half an hour .
I &apos;ll be there and I &apos;ll give him a $ 200 reward . &quot; &quot; Great , so I tell the guy , &quot; &quot; Look , relax .
Get yourself a fat reward . Life &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t do it .
I have this job interview in Galena in 15 minutes , and I need this job , I &apos;ve got to go . &quot; &quot; Again he asked me , &quot; &quot; What do you think we should do ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m in high school . I have no idea .
So I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll hold it for you . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve been so nice , let &apos;s split the reward . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll give you the jewelry , you give me a hundred dollars , and when the guy comes ... &quot; &quot; You see it . I was conned .
So this is a classic con called the pigeon drop , and I was the pigeon .
So the way many cons work is not that the conman gets the victim to trust him , it &apos;s that he shows he trusts the victim .
Now we know what happens .
The victim &apos;s brain releases oxytocin , and you &apos;re opening up your wallet or purse , giving away the money .
So who are these people who manipulate our oxytocin systems ?
We found , testing thousands of individuals , that five percent of the population don &apos;t release oxytocin on stimulus .
So if you trust them , their brains don &apos;t release oxytocin .
If there &apos;s money on the table , they keep it all .
So there &apos;s a technical word for these people in my lab .
We call them bastards .
( Laughter ) These are not people you want to have a beer with .
They have many of the attributes of psychopaths .
Now there are other ways the system can be inhibited .
One is through improper nurturing .
So we &apos;ve studied sexually abused women , and about half those don &apos;t release oxytocin on stimulus .
You need enough nurturing for this system to develop properly .
Also , high stress inhibits oxytocin .
So we all know this , when we &apos;re really stressed out , we &apos;re not acting our best .
There &apos;s another way oxytocin is inhibited , which is interesting — through the action of testosterone .
So we , in experiments , have administered testosterone to men .
And instead of sharing money , they become selfish .
But interestingly , high testosterone males are also more likely to use their own money to punish others for being selfish .
( Laughter ) Now think about this . It means , within our own biology , we have the yin and yang of morality .
We have oxytocin that connects us to others , makes us feel what they feel .
And we have testosterone .
And men have 10 times the testosterone as women , so men do this more than women — we have testosterone that makes us want to punish people who behave immorally .
We don &apos;t need God or government telling us what to do .
It &apos;s all inside of us .
So you may be wondering : these are beautiful laboratory experiments , do they really apply to real life ?
Yeah , I &apos;ve been worrying about that too .
So I &apos;ve gone out of the lab to see if this really holds in our daily lives .
So last summer , I attended a wedding in Southern England .
200 people in this beautiful Victorian mansion .
I didn &apos;t know a single person .
And I drove up in my rented Vauxhall .
And I took out a centrifuge and dry ice and needles and tubes .
And I took blood from the bride and the groom and the wedding party and the family and the friends before and immediately after the vows .
( Laughter ) And guess what ?
Weddings cause a release of oxytocin , but they do so in a very particular way .
Who is the center of the wedding solar system ?
The bride .
She had the biggest increase in oxytocin .
Who loves the wedding almost as much as the bride ?
Her mother , that &apos;s right .
Her mother was number two .
Then the groom &apos;s father , then the groom , then the family , then the friends — arrayed around the bride like planets around the Sun .
So I think it tells us that we &apos;ve designed this ritual to connect us to this new couple , connect us emotionally .
Why ? Because we need them to be successful at reproducing to perpetuate the species .
I also worried that my trust experiments with small amounts of money didn &apos;t really capture how often we actually trust our lives to strangers .
So even though I have a fear of heights , I recently strapped myself to another human being and stepped out of an airplane at 12,000 ft .
I took my blood before and after , and I had a huge spike of oxytocin .
And there are so many ways we can connect to people .
For example , through social media .
Many people are Tweeting right now .
So we investigated the role of social media and found the using social media produced a solid double-digit increase in oxytocin .
So I ran this experiment recently for the Korean Broadcasting System .
And they had the reporters and their producers participate .
And one of these guys , he must have been 22 , he had 150 percent spike in oxytocin .
I mean , astounding ; no one has this .
So he was using social media in private .
When I wrote my report to the Koreans , I said , &quot; &quot; Look , I don &apos;t know what this guy was doing , &quot; &quot; but my guess was interacting with his mother or his girlfriend .
They checked .
He was interacting on his girlfriend &apos;s Facebook page .
There you go . That &apos;s connection .
So there &apos;s tons of ways that we can connect to other people , and it seems to be universal .
Two weeks ago , I just got back from Papua New Guinea where I went up to the highlands — very isolated tribes of subsistence farmers living as they have lived for millenia .
There are 800 different languages in the highlands .
These are the most primitive people in the world .
And they indeed also release oxytocin .
So oxytocin connects us to other people .
Oxytocin makes us feel what other people feel .
And it &apos;s so easy to cause people &apos;s brains to release oxytocin .
I know how to do it , and my favorite way to do it is , in fact , the easiest .
Let me show it to you .
Come here . Give me a hug .
( Laughter ) There you go .
( Applause ) So my penchant for hugging other people has earned me the nickname Dr. Love .
I &apos;m happy to share a little more love in the world , it &apos;s great , but here &apos;s your prescription from Dr. Love : eight hugs a day .
We have found that people who release more oxytocin are happier .
And they &apos;re happier because they have better relationships of all types .
Dr. Love says eight hugs a day .
Eight hugs a day — you &apos;ll be happier and the world will be a better place .
Of course , if you don &apos;t like to touch people , I can always shove this up your nose .
( Laughter ) Thank you .
( Applause )
You &apos;re looking at a woman who was publicly silent for a decade .
Obviously , that &apos;s changed , but only recently .
It was several months ago that I gave my very first major public talk at the Forbes 30 Under 30 summit : 1,500 brilliant people , all under the age of 30 .
That meant that in 1998 , the oldest among the group were only 14 , and the youngest , just four .
I joked with them that some might only have heard of me from rap songs .
Yes , I &apos;m in rap songs .
Almost 40 rap songs . ( Laughter ) But the night of my speech , a surprising thing happened .
At the age of 41 , I was hit on by a 27-year-old guy .
I know , right ?
He was charming and I was flattered , and I declined .
You know what his unsuccessful pickup line was ?
He could make me feel 22 again .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I realized later that night , I &apos;m probably the only person over 40 who does not want to be 22 again . ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
At the age of 22 , I fell in love with my boss , and at the age of 24 , I learned the devastating consequences .
Can I see a show of hands of anyone here who didn &apos;t make a mistake or do something they regretted at 22 ?
Yep . That &apos;s what I thought .
So like me , at 22 , a few of you may have also taken wrong turns and fallen in love with the wrong person , maybe even your boss .
Unlike me , though , your boss probably wasn &apos;t the president of the United States of America .
Of course , life is full of surprises .
Not a day goes by that I &apos;m not reminded of my mistake , and I regret that mistake deeply .
In 1998 , after having been swept up into an improbable romance , I was then swept up into the eye of a political , legal and media maelstrom like we had never seen before .
Remember , just a few years earlier , news was consumed from just three places : reading a newspaper or magazine , listening to the radio , or watching television .
That was it .
But that wasn &apos;t my fate .
Instead , this scandal was brought to you by the digital revolution .
That meant we could access all the information we wanted , when we wanted it , anytime , anywhere , and when the story broke in January 1998 , it broke online .
It was the first time the traditional news was usurped by the Internet for a major news story , a click that reverberated around the world .
What that meant for me personally was that overnight I went from being a completely private figure to a publicly humiliated one worldwide .
I was patient zero of losing a personal reputation on a global scale almost instantaneously .
This rush to judgment , enabled by technology , led to mobs of virtual stone-throwers .
Granted , it was before social media , but people could still comment online , email stories , and , of course , email cruel jokes .
News sources plastered photos of me all over to sell newspapers , banner ads online , and to keep people tuned to the TV .
Do you recall a particular image of me , say , wearing a beret ?
Now , I admit I made mistakes , especially wearing that beret .
But the attention and judgment that I received , not the story , but that I personally received , was unprecedented .
I was branded as a tramp , tart , slut , whore , bimbo , and , of course , that woman .
I was seen by many but actually known by few .
And I get it : it was easy to forget that that woman was dimensional , had a soul , and was once unbroken .
When this happened to me 17 years ago , there was no name for it .
Now we call it cyberbullying and online harassment .
Today , I want to share some of my experience with you , talk about how that experience has helped shape my cultural observations , and how I hope my past experience can lead to a change that results in less suffering for others .
In 1998 , I lost my reputation and my dignity .
I lost almost everything , and I almost lost my life .
Let me paint a picture for you .
It is September of 1998 .
I &apos;m sitting in a windowless office room inside the Office of the Independent Counsel underneath humming fluorescent lights .
I &apos;m listening to the sound of my voice , my voice on surreptitiously taped phone calls that a supposed friend had made the year before .
I &apos;m here because I &apos;ve been legally required to personally authenticate all 20 hours of taped conversation .
For the past eight months , the mysterious content of these tapes has hung like the Sword of Damocles over my head .
I mean , who can remember what they said a year ago ?
Scared and mortified , I listen , listen as I prattle on about the flotsam and jetsam of the day ; listen as I confess my love for the president , and , of course , my heartbreak ; listen to my sometimes catty , sometimes churlish , sometimes silly self being cruel , unforgiving , uncouth ; listen , deeply , deeply ashamed , to the worst version of myself , a self I don &apos;t even recognize .
A few days later , the Starr Report is released to Congress , and all of those tapes and transcripts , those stolen words , form a part of it .
That people can read the transcripts is horrific enough , but a few weeks later , the audio tapes are aired on TV , and significant portions made available online .
The public humiliation was excruciating .
Life was almost unbearable .
This was not something that happened with regularity back then in 1998 , and by this , I mean the stealing of people &apos;s private words , actions , conversations or photos , and then making them public — public without consent , public without context , and public without compassion .
The consequences for some have become dire , very dire .
I was on the phone with my mom in September of 2010 , and we were talking about the news of a young college freshman from Rutgers University named Tyler Clementi .
One gossip website had over five million hits for this one story .
The documents which received the most attention were private emails that had maximum public embarrassment value .
But in this culture of humiliation , there is another kind of price tag attached to public shaming .
The price does not measure the cost to the victim , which Tyler and too many others , notably women , minorities , and members of the LGBTQ community have paid , but the price measures the profit of those who prey on them .
This invasion of others is a raw material , efficiently and ruthlessly mined , packaged and sold at a profit .
A marketplace has emerged where public humiliation is a commodity and shame is an industry .
How is the money made ?
Clicks .
The more shame , the more clicks .
The more clicks , the more advertising dollars .
We &apos;re in a dangerous cycle .
The more we click on this kind of gossip , the more numb we get to the human lives behind it , and the more numb we get , the more we click .
All the while , someone is making money off of the back of someone else &apos;s suffering .
With every click , we make a choice .
The more we saturate our culture with public shaming , the more accepted it is , the more we will see behavior like cyberbullying , trolling , some forms of hacking , and online harassment .
Why ? Because they all have humiliation at their cores .
This behavior is a symptom of the culture we &apos;ve created .
Just think about it .
Changing behavior begins with evolving beliefs .
We &apos;ve seen that to be true with racism , homophobia , and plenty of other biases , today and in the past .
When we began valuing sustainability , more people began to recycle .
So as far as our culture of humiliation goes , what we need is a cultural revolution .
Public shaming as a blood sport has to stop , and it &apos;s time for an intervention on the Internet and in our culture .
The shift begins with something simple , but it &apos;s not easy .
We need to return to a long-held value of compassion — compassion and empathy .
Online , we &apos;ve got a compassion deficit , an empathy crisis .
Researcher Brené Brown said , and I quote , &quot; Shame can &apos;t survive empathy . &quot;
Shame cannot survive empathy .
I &apos;ve seen some very dark days in my life , and it was the compassion and empathy from my family , friends , professionals , and sometimes even strangers that saved me .
Even empathy from one person can make a difference .
The theory of minority influence , proposed by social psychologist Serge Moscovici , says that even in small numbers , when there &apos;s consistency over time , change can happen .
In the online world , we can foster minority influence by becoming upstanders .
To become an upstander means instead of bystander apathy , we can post a positive comment for someone or report a bullying situation .
Trust me , compassionate comments help abate the negativity .
We can also counteract the culture by supporting organizations that deal with these kinds of issues , like the Tyler Clementi Foundation in the U.S. , In the U.K. , there &apos;s Anti-Bullying Pro , and in Australia , there &apos;s Project Rockit .
We talk a lot about our right to freedom of expression , but we need to talk more about our responsibility to freedom of expression .
We all want to be heard , but let &apos;s acknowledge the difference between speaking up with intention and speaking up for attention .
The Internet is the superhighway for the id , but online , showing empathy to others benefits us all and helps create a safer and better world .
We need to communicate online with compassion , consume news with compassion , and click with compassion .
Just imagine walking a mile in someone else &apos;s headline .
I &apos;d like to end on a personal note .
In the past nine months , the question I &apos;ve been asked the most is why .
Why now ? Why was I sticking my head above the parapet ?
You can read between the lines in those questions , and the answer has nothing to do with politics .
The top note answer was and is because it &apos;s time : time to stop tip-toeing around my past ; time to stop living a life of opprobrium ; and time to take back my narrative .
It &apos;s also not just about saving myself .
Anyone who is suffering from shame and public humiliation needs to know one thing : You can survive it .
I know it &apos;s hard .
It may not be painless , quick or easy , but you can insist on a different ending to your story .
Have compassion for yourself .
We all deserve compassion , and to live both online and off in a more compassionate world .
Thank you for listening .

Hello . My name is Birke Baehr , and I &apos;m 11 years old .
I came here today to talk about what &apos;s wrong with our food system .
First of all , I would like to say that I &apos;m really amazed at how easily kids are led to believe all the marketing and advertising on TV , at public schools and pretty much everywhere else you look .
It seems to me like corporations are always trying to get kids , like me , to get their parents to buy stuff that really isn &apos;t good for us or the planet .
Little kids , especially , are attracted by colorful packaging and plastic toys .
I must admit , I used to be one of them .
I also used to think that all of our food came from these happy , little farms where pigs rolled in mud and cows grazed on grass all day .
What I discovered was this is not true .
I began to look into this stuff on the Internet , in books and in documentary films , in my travels with my family .
I discovered the dark side of the industrialized food system .
First , there &apos;s genetically engineered seeds and organisms .
That is when a seed is manipulated in a laboratory to do something not intended by nature — like taking the DNA of a fish and putting it into the DNA of a tomato . Yuck .
Don &apos;t get me wrong , I like fish and tomatoes , but this is just creepy .
( Laughter ) The seeds are then planted , then grown .
The food they produce have been proven to cause cancer and other problems in lab animals , and people have been eating food produced this way since the 1990s .
And most folks don &apos;t even know they exist .
Did you know rats that ate genetically engineered corn had developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity ?
These include kidney inflammation and lesions and increased kidney weight .
Yet almost all the corn we eat has been altered genetically in some way .
And let me tell you , corn is in everything .
And don &apos;t even get me started on the Confined Animal Feeding Operations called CAFOS .
( Laughter ) Conventional farmers use chemical fertilizers made from fossil fuels that they mix with the dirt to make plants grow .
They do this because they &apos;ve stripped the soil from all nutrients from growing the same crop over and over again .
Next , more harmful chemicals are sprayed on fruits and vegetables , like pesticides and herbicides , to kill weeds and bugs .
When it rains , these chemicals seep into the ground , or run off into our waterways , poisoning our water too .
Then they irradiate our food , trying to make it last longer , so it can travel thousands of miles from where it &apos;s grown to the supermarkets .
So I ask myself , how can I change ? How can I change these things ?
This is what I found out .
I discovered that there &apos;s a movement for a better way .
Now a while back , I wanted to be an NFL football player .
I decided that I &apos;d rather be an organic farmer instead .
( Applause ) Thank you .
And that way I can have a greater impact on the world .
This man , Joel Salatin , they call him a lunatic farmer because he grows against the system .
Since I &apos;m home-schooled , I went to go hear him speak one day .
This man , this &quot; &quot; lunatic farmer , &quot; &quot; doesn &apos;t use any pesticides , herbicides , or genetically modified seeds .
And so for that , he &apos;s called crazy by the system .
I want you to know that we can all make a difference by making different choices , by buying our food directly from local farmers , or our neighbors who we know in real life .
Some people say organic or local food is more expensive , but is it really ?
With all these things I &apos;ve been learning about the food system , it seems to me that we can either pay the farmer , or we can pay the hospital .
( Applause ) Now I know definitely which one I would choose .
I want you to know that there are farms out there — like Bill Keener in Sequatchie Cove Farm in Tennessee — whose cows do eat grass and whose pigs do roll in the mud , just like I thought .
Sometimes I go to Bill &apos;s farm and volunteer , so I can see up close and personal where the meat I eat comes from .
I want you to know that I believe kids will eat fresh vegetables and good food if they know more about it and where it really comes from .
I want you to know that there are farmers &apos; markets in every community popping up .
I want you to know that me , my brother and sister actually like eating baked kale chips .
I try to share this everywhere I go .
Not too long ago , my uncle said that he offered my six-year-old cousin cereal .
He asked him if he wanted organic Toasted O &apos;s or the sugarcoated flakes — you know , the one with the big striped cartoon character on the front .
My little cousin told his dad that he would rather have the organic Toasted O &apos;s cereal because Birke said he shouldn &apos;t eat sparkly cereal .
And that , my friends , is how we can make a difference one kid at a time .
So next time you &apos;re at the grocery store , think local , choose organic , know your farmer and know your food .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I love a great mystery , and I &apos;m fascinated by the greatest unsolved mystery in science , perhaps because it &apos;s personal .
It &apos;s about who we are , and I can &apos;t help but be curious .
The mystery is this : What is the relationship between your brain and your conscious experiences , such as your experience of the taste of chocolate or the feeling of velvet ?
Now , this mystery is not new .
In 1868 , Thomas Huxley wrote , &quot; &quot; How it is that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as the result of irritating nervous tissue is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the genie when Aladdin rubbed his lamp . &quot; &quot; Now , Huxley knew that brain activity and conscious experiences are correlated , but he didn &apos;t know why .
To the science of his day , it was a mystery .
In the years since Huxley , science has learned a lot about brain activity , but the relationship between brain activity and conscious experiences is still a mystery .
Why ? Why have we made so little progress ?
Well , some experts think that we can &apos;t solve this problem because we lack the necessary concepts and intelligence .
We don &apos;t expect monkeys to solve problems in quantum mechanics , and as it happens , we can &apos;t expect our species to solve this problem either .
Well , I disagree . I &apos;m more optimistic .
I think we &apos;ve simply made a false assumption .
Once we fix it , we just might solve this problem .
Today , I &apos;d like tell you what that assumption is , why it &apos;s false , and how to fix it .
Let &apos;s begin with a question : Do we see reality as it is ?
I open my eyes and I have an experience that I describe as a red tomato a meter away .
As a result , I come to believe that in reality , there &apos;s a red tomato a meter away .
I then close my eyes , and my experience changes to a gray field , but is it still the case that in reality , there &apos;s a red tomato a meter away ?
I think so , but could I be wrong ?
Could I be misinterpreting the nature of my perceptions ?
We have misinterpreted our perceptions before .
We used to think the Earth is flat , because it looks that way .
Pythagorus discovered that we were wrong .
Then we thought that the Earth is the unmoving center of the Universe , again because it looks that way .
Copernicus and Galileo discovered , again , that we were wrong .
Galileo then wondered if we might be misinterpreting our experiences in other ways .
He wrote : &quot; &quot; I think that tastes , odors , colors , and so on reside in consciousness .
Hence if the living creature were removed , all these qualities would be annihilated . &quot; &quot; Now , that &apos;s a stunning claim .
Could Galileo be right ?
Could we really be misinterpreting our experiences that badly ?
What does modern science have to say about this ?
Well , neuroscientists tell us that about a third of the brain &apos;s cortex is engaged in vision .
When you simply open your eyes and look about this room , billions of neurons and trillions of synapses are engaged .
Now , this is a bit surprising , because to the extent that we think about vision at all , we think of it as like a camera .
It just takes a picture of objective reality as it is .
Now , there is a part of vision that &apos;s like a camera : the eye has a lens that focuses an image on the back of the eye where there are 130 million photoreceptors , so the eye is like a 130-megapixel camera .
But that doesn &apos;t explain the billions of neurons and trillions of synapses that are engaged in vision .
What are these neurons up to ?
Well , neuroscientists tell us that they are creating , in real time , all the shapes , objects , colors , and motions that we see .
It feels like we &apos;re just taking a snapshot of this room the way it is , but in fact , we &apos;re constructing everything that we see .
We don &apos;t construct the whole world at once .
We construct what we need in the moment .
Now , there are many demonstrations that are quite compelling that we construct what we see .
I &apos;ll just show you two .
In this example , you see some red discs with bits cut out of them , but if I just rotate the disks a little bit , suddenly , you see a 3D cube pop out of the screen .
Now , the screen of course is flat , so the three-dimensional cube that you &apos;re experiencing must be your construction .
In this next example , you see glowing blue bars with pretty sharp edges moving across a field of dots .
In fact , no dots move .
All I &apos;m doing from frame to frame is changing the colors of dots from blue to black or black to blue .
But when I do this quickly , your visual system creates the glowing blue bars with the sharp edges and the motion .
There are many more examples , but these are just two that you construct what you see .
But neuroscientists go further .
They say that we reconstruct reality .
So , when I have an experience that I describe as a red tomato , that experience is actually an accurate reconstruction of the properties of a real red tomato that would exist even if I weren &apos;t looking .
Now , why would neuroscientists say that we don &apos;t just construct , we reconstruct ?
Well , the standard argument given is usually an evolutionary one .
Those of our ancestors who saw more accurately had a competitive advantage compared to those who saw less accurately , and therefore they were more likely to pass on their genes .
We are the offspring of those who saw more accurately , and so we can be confident that , in the normal case , our perceptions are accurate .
You see this in the standard textbooks .
One textbook says , for example , &quot; &quot; Evolutionarily speaking , vision is useful precisely because it is so accurate . &quot; &quot; So the idea is that accurate perceptions are fitter perceptions .
They give you a survival advantage .
Now , is this correct ?
Is this the right interpretation of evolutionary theory ?
Well , let &apos;s first look at a couple of examples in nature .
The Australian jewel beetle is dimpled , glossy and brown .
The female is flightless .
The male flies , looking , of course , for a hot female .
When he finds one , he alights and mates .
There &apos;s another species in the outback , Homo sapiens .
The male of this species has a massive brain that he uses to hunt for cold beer .
( Laughter ) And when he finds one , he drains it , and sometimes throws the bottle into the outback .
Now , as it happens , these bottles are dimpled , glossy , and just the right shade of brown to tickle the fancy of these beetles .
The males swarm all over the bottles trying to mate .
They lose all interest in the real females .
Classic case of the male leaving the female for the bottle .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The species almost went extinct .
Australia had to change its bottles to save its beetles .
( Laughter ) Now , the males had successfully found females for thousands , perhaps millions of years .
It looked like they saw reality as it is , but apparently not .
Evolution had given them a hack .
A female is anything dimpled , glossy and brown , the bigger the better .
( Laughter ) Even when crawling all over the bottle , the male couldn &apos;t discover his mistake .
Now , you might say , beetles , sure , they &apos;re very simple creatures , but surely not mammals .
Mammals don &apos;t rely on tricks .
Well , I won &apos;t dwell on this , but you get the idea . ( Laughter ) So this raises an important technical question : Does natural selection really favor seeing reality as it is ?
Fortunately , we don &apos;t have to wave our hands and guess ; evolution is a mathematically precise theory .
We can use the equations of evolution to check this out .
We can have various organisms in artificial worlds compete and see which survive and which thrive , which sensory systems are more fit .
A key notion in those equations is fitness .
Consider this steak : What does this steak do for the fitness of an animal ?
Well , for a hungry lion looking to eat , it enhances fitness .
For a well-fed lion looking to mate , it doesn &apos;t enhance fitness .
And for a rabbit in any state , it doesn &apos;t enhance fitness , so fitness does depend on reality as it is , yes , but also on the organism , its state and its action .
Fitness is not the same thing as reality as it is , and it &apos;s fitness , and not reality as it is , that figures centrally in the equations of evolution .
So , in my lab , we have run hundreds of thousands of evolutionary game simulations with lots of different randomly chosen worlds and organisms that compete for resources in those worlds .
Some of the organisms see all of the reality , others see just part of the reality , and some see none of the reality , only fitness .
Who wins ?
Well , I hate to break it to you , but perception of reality goes extinct .
In almost every simulation , organisms that see none of reality but are just tuned to fitness drive to extinction all the organisms that perceive reality as it is .
So the bottom line is , evolution does not favor veridical , or accurate perceptions .
Those perceptions of reality go extinct .
Now , this is a bit stunning .
How can it be that not seeing the world accurately gives us a survival advantage ?
That is a bit counterintuitive .
But remember the jewel beetle .
The jewel beetle survived for thousands , perhaps millions of years , using simple tricks and hacks .
What the equations of evolution are telling us is that all organisms , including us , are in the same boat as the jewel beetle .
We do not see reality as it is .
We &apos;re shaped with tricks and hacks that keep us alive .
Still , we need some help with our intuitions .
How can not perceiving reality as it is be useful ?
Well , fortunately , we have a very helpful metaphor : the desktop interface on your computer .
Consider that blue icon for a TED Talk that you &apos;re writing .
Now , the icon is blue and rectangular and in the lower right corner of the desktop .
Does that mean that the text file itself in the computer is blue , rectangular , and in the lower right-hand corner of the computer ?
Of course not .
Anyone who thought that misinterprets the purpose of the interface .
It &apos;s not there to show you the reality of the computer .
In fact , it &apos;s there to hide that reality .
You don &apos;t want to know about the diodes and resistors and all the megabytes of software .
If you had to deal with that , you could never write your text file or edit your photo .
So the idea is that evolution has given us an interface that hides reality and guides adaptive behavior .
Space and time , as you perceive them right now , are your desktop .
Physical objects are simply icons in that desktop .
There &apos;s an obvious objection .
Hoffman , if you think that train coming down the track at 200 MPH is just an icon of your desktop , why don &apos;t you step in front of it ?
And after you &apos;re gone , and your theory with you , we &apos;ll know that there &apos;s more to that train than just an icon .
Well , I wouldn &apos;t step in front of that train for the same reason that I wouldn &apos;t carelessly drag that icon to the trash can : not because I take the icon literally — the file is not literally blue or rectangular — but I do take it seriously .
I could lose weeks of work .
Similarly , evolution has shaped us with perceptual symbols that are designed to keep us alive .
We &apos;d better take them seriously .
If you see a snake , don &apos;t pick it up .
If you see a cliff , don &apos;t jump off .
They &apos;re designed to keep us safe , and we should take them seriously .
That does not mean that we should take them literally .
That &apos;s a logical error .
Another objection : There &apos;s nothing really new here .
Physicists have told us for a long time that the metal of that train looks solid but really it &apos;s mostly empty space with microscopic particles zipping around .
There &apos;s nothing new here .
Well , not exactly .
It &apos;s like saying , I know that that blue icon on the desktop is not the reality of the computer , but if I pull out my trusty magnifying glass and look really closely , I see little pixels , and that &apos;s the reality of the computer .
Well , not really — you &apos;re still on the desktop , and that &apos;s the point .
Those microscopic particles are still in space and time : they &apos;re still in the user interface .
So I &apos;m saying something far more radical than those physicists .
Finally , you might object , look , we all see the train , therefore none of us constructs the train .
But remember this example .
In this example , we all see a cube , but the screen is flat , so the cube that you see is the cube that you construct .
We all see a cube because we all , each one of us , constructs the cube that we see .
The same is true of the train .
We all see a train because we each see the train that we construct , and the same is true of all physical objects .
We &apos;re inclined to think that perception is like a window on reality as it is .
The theory of evolution is telling us that this is an incorrect interpretation of our perceptions .
Instead , reality is more like a 3D desktop that &apos;s designed to hide the complexity of the real world and guide adaptive behavior .
Space as you perceive it is your desktop .
Physical objects are just the icons in that desktop .
We used to think that the Earth is flat because it looks that way .
Then we thought that the Earth is the unmoving center of reality because it looks that way .
We were wrong .
We had misinterpreted our perceptions .
Now we believe that spacetime and objects are the nature of reality as it is .
The theory of evolution is telling us that once again , we &apos;re wrong .
We &apos;re misinterpreting the content of our perceptual experiences .
There &apos;s something that exists when you don &apos;t look , but it &apos;s not spacetime and physical objects .
It &apos;s as hard for us to let go of spacetime and objects as it is for the jewel beetle to let go of its bottle .
Why ? Because we &apos;re blind to our own blindnesses .
But we have an advantage over the jewel beetle : our science and technology .
By peering through the lens of a telescope we discovered that the Earth is not the unmoving center of reality , and by peering through the lens of the theory of evolution we discovered that spacetime and objects are not the nature of reality .
When I have a perceptual experience that I describe as a red tomato , I am interacting with reality , but that reality is not a red tomato and is nothing like a red tomato .
Similarly , when I have an experience that I describe as a lion or a steak , I &apos;m interacting with reality , but that reality is not a lion or a steak .
And here &apos;s the kicker : When I have a perceptual experience that I describe as a brain , or neurons , I am interacting with reality , but that reality is not a brain or neurons and is nothing like a brain or neurons .
And that reality , whatever it is , is the real source of cause and effect in the world — not brains , not neurons .
Brains and neurons have no causal powers .
They cause none of our perceptual experiences , and none of our behavior .
Brains and neurons are a species-specific set of symbols , a hack .
What does this mean for the mystery of consciousness ?
Well , it opens up new possibilities .
For instance , perhaps reality is some vast machine that causes our conscious experiences .
I doubt this , but it &apos;s worth exploring .
Perhaps reality is some vast , interacting network of conscious agents , simple and complex , that cause each other &apos;s conscious experiences .
Actually , this isn &apos;t as crazy an idea as it seems , and I &apos;m currently exploring it .
But here &apos;s the point : Once we let go of our massively intuitive but massively false assumption about the nature of reality , it opens up new ways to think about life &apos;s greatest mystery .
I bet that reality will end up turning out to be more fascinating and unexpected than we &apos;ve ever imagined .
The theory of evolution presents us with the ultimate dare : Dare to recognize that perception is not about seeing truth , it &apos;s about having kids .
And by the way , even this TED is just in your head .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : If that &apos;s really you there , thank you .
So there &apos;s so much from this .
I mean , first of all , some people may just be profoundly depressed at the thought that , if evolution does not favor reality , I mean , doesn &apos;t that to some extent undermine all our endeavors here , all our ability to think that we can think the truth , possibly even including your own theory , if you go there ?
Donald Hoffman : Well , this does not stop us from a successful science .
What we have is one theory that turned out to be false , that perception is like reality and reality is like our perceptions .
That theory turns out to be false .
Okay , throw that theory away .
That doesn &apos;t stop us from now postulating all sorts of other theories about the nature of reality , so it &apos;s actually progress to recognize that one of our theories was false .
So science continues as normal . There &apos;s no problem here .
CA : So you think it &apos;s possible — ( Laughter ) — This is cool , but what you &apos;re saying I think is it &apos;s possible that evolution can still get you to reason .
DH : Yes . Now that &apos;s a very , very good point .
The evolutionary game simulations that I showed were specifically about perception , and they do show that our perceptions have been shaped not to show us reality as it is , but that does not mean the same thing about our logic or mathematics .
We haven &apos;t done these simulations , but my bet is that we &apos;ll find that there are some selection pressures for our logic and our mathematics to be at least in the direction of truth .
I mean , if you &apos;re like me , math and logic is not easy .
We don &apos;t get it all right , but at least the selection pressures are not uniformly away from true math and logic .
So I think that we &apos;ll find that we have to look at each cognitive faculty one at a time and see what evolution does to it .
What &apos;s true about perception may not be true about math and logic .
CA : I mean , really what you &apos;re proposing is a kind of modern-day Bishop Berkeley interpretation of the world : consciousness causes matter , not the other way around .
DH : Well , it &apos;s slightly different than Berkeley .
Berkeley thought that , he was a deist , and he thought that the ultimate nature of reality is God and so forth , and I don &apos;t need to go where Berkeley &apos;s going , so it &apos;s quite a bit different from Berkeley .
I call this conscious realism . It &apos;s actually a very different approach .
CA : Don , I could literally talk with you for hours , and I hope to do that .
Thanks so much for that . DH : Thank you . ( Applause )
When we &apos;re designing new products , services or businesses , the only time you &apos;ll know if they &apos;re any good , if the designs are good , is to see how they &apos;re used in the real world , in context .
I &apos;m reminded of that every time I walk past Highbury Fields in north London .
It &apos;s absolutely beautiful .
There &apos;s a big open green space .
There &apos;s Georgian buildings around the side .
But then there &apos;s this mud trap that cuts across the middle .
People clearly don &apos;t want to walk all the way around the edge .
Instead , they want to take the shortcut , and that shortcut is self-reinforcing .
Now , this shortcut is called a desire path , and it &apos;s often the path of least resistance .
I find them fascinating , because they &apos;re often the point where design and user experience diverge .
Now at this point , I should apologize , because you guys are going to start seeing these everywhere .
But today , I &apos;m going to pick three I find interesting and share what actually it reminds me about launching new products and services .
The first is in the capital city of Brazil — Brasilia .
And it reminds me that sometimes , you have to just focus on designing for a real need at low friction .
Now , Brasilia is fascinating .
It was designed by Niemeyer in the &apos; 50s .
It was the golden age of flying , so he laid it out like a plane , as you can see there .
Slightly worryingly , he put most of the important government buildings in the cockpit .
But if you zoom in , in the very center of Brasilia , just where the point is there , you see it &apos;s littered with desire paths .
They &apos;re absolutely everywhere .
Now , they thought that they had future-proofed this design .
They thought in the future we wouldn &apos;t need to walk anywhere — we &apos;d be able to drive — so there was little need for walkways or pavements .
But as you can see , there &apos;s a real need .
These are very dangerous desire paths .
If we just pick one , in the middle , you can see it crosses 15 lanes of traffic .
It won &apos;t surprise you guys that Brasilia has five times the pedestrian accident rate of your average US city .
People are resourceful .
They &apos;ll always find the low-friction route to save money , save time .
Not all these desire paths are dangerous , I was reminded flying here when I was in Heathrow .
Many of us get frustrated when we &apos;re confronted with the obligatory walk through duty-free .
It was amazing to me how many people refused to take the long , meandering path to the left , and just cut through to the right , cut through the desire path .
The question that &apos;s interesting is : What do designers think when they see our behavior here ?
Do they think we &apos;re stupid ?
Do they think we &apos;re lazy ?
Or do they accept that this is the only truth ?
This is their product .
We &apos;re effectively co-designing their product .
So our job is to design for real needs at low friction , because if you don &apos;t , the customer will , anyway .
The second desire path I wanted to share is at the University of California .
And it reminds me that sometimes the best way to come up with a great design is just to launch it .
Now , university campuses are fantastic for spotting desire paths .
I think it &apos;s because students are always late and they &apos;re pretty smart .
So they &apos;re dashing to lectures .
They &apos;ll always find the shortcut .
And the designers here knew that .
So they built the buildings and then they waited a few months for the paths to form .
They then paved them .
( Laughter ) Incredibly smart approach .
In fact , often , just launching the straw man of a service can teach you what people really want .
For example , Ayr Muir in Boston knew he wanted to open a restaurant .
But where should it be ?
What should the menu be ?
He launched a service , in this case a food truck , and he changed the location each day .
He &apos;d write a different menu on the side in a whiteboard marker to figure out what people wanted .
He now has a chain of restaurants .
So it can be incredibly efficient to launch something to spot the desire paths .
The third and final desire path I wanted to share with you is the UNIH .
It reminds me that the world &apos;s in flux , and we have to respond to those changes .
So as you &apos;ll guess , this is a hospital .
I &apos;ve marked for you on the left the Oncology Department .
The patients would usually stay in the hotels down on the bottom right .
This was a patient-centered organization , so they laid on cars for their patients .
But what they realized when they started offering chemotherapy is the patients rarely wanted to get in cars .
They were too nauseous , so they &apos;d walk back to their hotels .
This desire path that you see diagonally , formed .
The patients even called it &quot; &quot; The Chemo Trail . &quot; &quot; Now , when the hospital saw this originally , they tried to lay turf back over it , ignore it .
But after a while , they realized it was an important need they were meeting for their patients , so they paved it .
And I think our job is often to pave these emerging desire paths .
If we look back at the one in North London again , that desire path hasn &apos;t always been there .
The reason it sprung up is people were traveling to the mighty Arsenal Football Club stadium on game days , from the Underground station you see on the bottom right .
So you see the desire path .
If we just wind the clock back a few years , when the stadium was being constructed , there is no desire path .
So our job is to watch for these desire paths emerging , and , where appropriate , pave them , as someone did here .
Someone installed a barrier , people started walking across and round the bottom as you see , and they paved it .
( Laughter ) But I think this is a wonderful reminder as well , that , actually , the world is in flux .
It &apos;s constantly changing , because if you look at the top of this image , there &apos;s another desire path forming .
So these three desire paths remind me we need to design for real human needs .
I think empathy for what your customers want is probably the biggest leading indicator of business success .
Design for real needs and design them in low friction , because if you don &apos;t offer them in low friction , someone else will , often the customer .
Secondly , often the best way to learn what people really want is to launch your service .
The answer is rarely inside the building .
Get out there and see what people really want .
And finally , in part because of technology , the world is incredibly flux at the moment .
It &apos;s changing constantly .
These desire paths are going to spring up faster than ever .
Our job is to pick the appropriate ones and pave over them .
Thank you very much .

Democracy .
In the West , we make a colossal mistake taking it for granted .
We see democracy not as the most fragile of flowers that it really is , but we see it as part of our society &apos;s furniture .
We tend to think of it as an intransigent given .
We mistakenly believe that capitalism begets inevitably democracy .
It doesn &apos;t .
Singapore &apos;s Lee Kuan Yew and his great imitators in Beijing have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that it is perfectly possible to have a flourishing capitalism , spectacular growth , while politics remains democracy-free .
Indeed , democracy is receding in our neck of the woods , here in Europe .
Earlier this year , while I was representing Greece — the newly elected Greek government — in the Eurogroup as its Finance Minister , I was told in no uncertain terms that our nation &apos;s democratic process — our elections — could not be allowed to interfere with economic policies that were being implemented in Greece .
Tonight , here , I want to present to you an economic case for an authentic democracy .
I want to ask you to join me in believing again that Lee Kuan Yew , the Chinese Communist Party and indeed the Eurogroup are wrong in believing that we can dispense with democracy — that we need an authentic , boisterous democracy .
And without democracy , our societies will be nastier , our future bleak and our great , new technologies wasted .
Speaking of waste , allow me to point out an interesting paradox that is threatening our economies as we speak .
I call it the twin peaks paradox .
But few people discern its twin .
A mountain of idle cash belonging to rich savers and to corporations , too terrified to invest it into the productive activities that can generate the incomes from which you can extinguish the mountain of debts and which can produce all those things that humanity desperately needs , like green energy .
Now let me give you two numbers .
$ 3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money until you compare it to the $ 5.1 trillion that has been slushing around in the same countries , in our financial institutions , doing absolutely nothing during the same period except inflating stock exchanges and bidding up house prices .
So a mountain of debt and a mountain of idle cash form twin peaks , failing to cancel each other out through the normal operation of the markets .
This is my quarrel with capitalism .
Am I right in believing that democracy might be the answer ?
I believe so , but before we move on , what do we mean by democracy ?
Aristotle defined democracy as the constitution in which the free and the poor , being in the majority , control government .
Now , of course Athenian democracy excluded too many .
Women , migrants and , of course , the slaves .
Now , of course , Athenian democracy didn &apos;t last long .
Like a candle that burns brightly , it burned out quickly .
They have their roots in the Magna Carta , in the 1688 Glorious Revolution , indeed in the American constitution .
Whereas Athenian democracy was focusing on the masterless citizen and empowering the working poor , our liberal democracies are founded on the Magna Carta tradition , which was , after all , a charter for masters .
Now , in our democracies today , this separation of the economic from the political sphere , the moment it started happening , it gave rise to an inexorable , epic struggle between the two , with the economic sphere colonizing the political sphere , eating into its power .
Have you wondered why politicians are not what they used to be ?
It &apos;s not because their DNA has degenerated .
( Laughter ) It is rather because one can be in government today and not in power , because power has migrated from the political to the economic sphere , which is separate .
Indeed , I spoke about my quarrel with capitalism .
Corporate power is increasing , political goods are devaluing , inequality is rising , aggregate demand is falling and CEOs of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their corporations .
So the more capitalism succeeds in taking the demos out of democracy , the taller the twin peaks and the greater the waste of human resources and humanity &apos;s wealth .
Clearly , if this is right , we must reunite the political and economic spheres and better do it with a demos being in control , like in ancient Athens except without the slaves or the exclusion of women and migrants .
Now , this is not an original idea .
The Marxist left had that idea 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t go very well , did it ?
But there is a solution : eliminate the working poor .
Capitalism &apos;s doing it by replacing low-wage workers with automata , androids , robots .
So we need to reconfigure , we need to reunite the economic and the political spheres , but we &apos;d better do it by democratizing the reunified sphere , lest we end up with a surveillance-mad hyperautocracy that makes The Matrix , the movie , look like a documentary .
( Laughter ) So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technological innovations it is spawning .
The more interesting question is whether capitalism will be succeeded by something resembling a Matrix dystopia or something much closer to a Star Trek-like society , where machines serve the humans and the humans expend their energies exploring the universe and indulging in long debates about the meaning of life in some ancient , Athenian-like , high tech agora .
I think we can afford to be optimistic .
But what would it take , what would it look like to have this Star Trek-like utopia , instead of the Matrix-like dystopia ?
In practical terms , allow me to share just briefly , a couple of examples .
At the level of the enterprise , imagine a capital market , where you earn capital as you work , and where your capital follows you from one job to another , from one company to another , and the company — whichever one you happen to work at at that time — is solely owned by those who happen to work in it at that moment .
Then all income stems from capital , from profits , and the very concept of wage labor becomes obsolete .
No more separation between those who own but do not work in the company and those who work but do not own the company ; no more tug-of-war between capital and labor ; no great gap between investment and saving ; indeed , no towering twin peaks .
At the level of the global political economy , imagine for a moment that our national currencies have a free-floating exchange rate , with a universal , global , digital currency , one that is issued by the International Monetary Fund , the G-20 , on behalf of all humanity .
And imagine that that fund is utilized to invest in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funding is scarce .
This is not a new idea .
It &apos;s what , effectively , John Maynard Keynes proposed in 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference .
The problem is that back then , they didn &apos;t have the technology to implement it .
Now we do , especially in the context of a reunified political-economic sphere .
Will such a world dawn ?
Or shall we descend into a Matrix-like dystopia ?
The answer lies in the political choice that we shall be making collectively .
It is our choice , and we &apos;d better make it democratically .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Bruno Giussani : Yanis ...
It was you who described yourself in your bios as a libertarian Marxist .
What is the relevance of Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yanis Varoufakis : Well , if there was any relevance in what I just said , then Marx is relevant .
Because the whole point of reunifying the political and economic is — if we don &apos;t do it , then technological innovation is going to create such a massive fall in aggregate demand , what Larry Summers refers to as secular stagnation .
With this crisis migrating from one part of the world , as it is now , it will destabilize not only our democracies , but even the emerging world that is not that keen on liberal democracy .
So if this analysis holds water , then Marx is absolutely relevant .
But so is Hayek , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a libertarian Marxist , and so is Keynes , so that &apos;s why I &apos;m totally confused .
( Laughter ) BG : Indeed , and possibly we are too , now . ( Laughter )
( Applause ) YV : If you are not confused , you are not thinking , OK ?
Would you like to share that ?
YV : Well , there &apos;s a great degree of hypocrisy .
In our liberal democracies , we have a semblance of democracy .
In a sense , if I am allowed to be provocative , China today is closer to Britain in the 19th century .
So what you are seeing now in China is a very similar process to the one that we had in Britain during the Industrial Revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
And to be castigating China for doing that which the West did in the 19th century , smacks of hypocrisy .
BG : I am sure that many people here are wondering about your experience as the Finance Minister of Greece earlier this year .
BG : Yes .
BG : Six months after , how do you look back at the first half of the year ?
YV : Extremely exciting , from a personal point of view , and very disappointing , because we had an opportunity to reboot the Eurozone .
Not just Greece , the Eurozone .
And , unfortunately , the powers in the Eurozone , in the Eurogroup , chose to maintain denial .
But you know what happens .
This is the experience of the Soviet Union .
When you try to keep alive an economic system that architecturally cannot survive , through political will and through authoritarianism , you may succeed in prolonging it , but when change happens it happens very abruptly and catastrophically .
BG : What kind of change are you foreseeing ?
YV : Well , there &apos;s no doubt that if we don &apos;t change the architecture of the Eurozone , the Eurozone has no future .
BG : Did you make any mistakes when you were Finance Minister ?
YV : Every day .
BG : For example ? YV : Anybody who looks back — ( Applause ) No , but seriously .
If there &apos;s any Minister of Finance , or of anything else for that matter , who tells you after six months in a job , especially in such a stressful situation , that they have made no mistake , they &apos;re dangerous people .
Of course I made mistakes .
I was imagining that there was a genuine interest on the side of the creditors to find common ground .
And there wasn &apos;t .
And because they didn &apos;t want to admit that for five years they were implementing a catastrophic program in Greece .
We lost one-third of our nominal GDP .
This is worse than the Great Depression .
YV : Absolutely .
Look , my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone comes from a person who lives and breathes Europe .
My greatest fear is that the Eurozone will not survive .
Because if it doesn &apos;t , the centrifugal forces that will be unleashed will be demonic , and they will destroy the European Union .
And that will be catastrophic not just for Europe but for the whole global economy .
We are probably the largest economy in the world .
BG : We definitely hope you are wrong on that point .
Yanis , thank you for coming to TED .
YV : Thank you .

If you want to see the features of this car , you can see it here .
So let &apos;s pull up , now , something else .
This is actually live on the Web now ; you can go check it out .
This is a project called Photosynth , which marries two different technologies .
I &apos;m not sure if I have time to show you any other environments .
And so these are all Flickr images , and they &apos;ve all been related spatially in this way .
We can just navigate in this very simple way .
Their own photos are getting tagged with meta-data that somebody else entered .
It &apos;s doing that based on the content inside the images .
When I was nine years old , I went off to summer camp for the first time .
And this might sound antisocial to you , but for us it was really just a different way of being social .
And I had this idea that camp was going to be just like this , but better .
Camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol .
And it went like this : &quot; &quot; R-O-W-D-I-E , that &apos;s the way we spell rowdie .
( Laughter ) But I recited a cheer . I recited a cheer along with everybody else .
And I just waited for the time that I could go off and read my books .
Now , I tell you this story about summer camp .
I could have told you 50 others just like it — all the times that I got the message that somehow my quiet and introverted style of being was not necessarily the right way to go , that I should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert .
And I always sensed deep down that this was wrong and that introverts were pretty excellent just as they were .
And at the risk of sounding grandiose , it is the world &apos;s loss .
Because when it comes to creativity and to leadership , we need introverts doing what they do best .
So that &apos;s one out of every two or three people you know .
So even if you &apos;re an extrovert yourself , I &apos;m talking about your coworkers and your spouses and your children and the person sitting next to you right now — all of them subject to this bias that is pretty deep and real in our society .
Now , to see the bias clearly , you need to understand what introversion is .
It &apos;s different from being shy .
Shyness is about fear of social judgment .
Introversion is more about , how do you respond to stimulation , including social stimulation .
But now here &apos;s where the bias comes in .
Our most important institutions , our schools and our workplaces , they are designed mostly for extroverts and for extroverts &apos; need for lots of stimulation .
And also we have this belief system right now that I call the new groupthink , which holds that all creativity and all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place .
We sat in rows of desks like this , and we did most of our work pretty autonomously .
And kids are working in countless group assignments .
( Laughter ) Okay , same thing is true in our workplaces .
Now , most of us work in open plan offices , without walls , where we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our coworkers .
Now in fact , some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts .
And they all took the spotlight , even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to .
I always like to say some of my best friends are extroverts , including my beloved husband .
And some people fall smack in the middle of the introvert / extrovert spectrum , and we call these people ambiverts .
And I often think that they have the best of all worlds .
And what I &apos;m saying is that culturally , we need a much better balance .
And in fact , we have known for centuries about the transcendent power of solitude .
It &apos;s only recently that we &apos;ve strangely begun to forget it .
This is no surprise , though , if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology .
It turns out that we can &apos;t even be in a group of people without instinctively mirroring , mimicking their opinions .
So — ( Laughter ) You might be following the person with the best ideas , but you might not .
And do you really want to leave it up to chance ?
Now if all this is true , then why are we getting it so wrong ?
Why are we setting up our schools this way , and our workplaces ?
Western societies , and in particular the U.S. , have always favored the man of action over the &quot; &quot; man &quot; &quot; of contemplation .
And they featured role models like Abraham Lincoln , who was praised for being modest and unassuming .
But then we hit the 20th century , and we entered a new culture that historians call the culture of personality .
So , quite understandably , qualities like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important .
So that &apos;s the world we &apos;re living in today .
Now none of this is to say that social skills are unimportant , and I &apos;m also not calling for the abolishing of teamwork at all .
So now I &apos;d like to share with you what &apos;s in my suitcase today .
Guess what ?
Books .
I have a suitcase full of books .
Here &apos;s Margaret Atwood , &quot; &quot; Cat &apos;s Eye . &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s a novel by Milan Kundera .
And here &apos;s &quot; &quot; The Guide for the Perplexed &quot; &quot; by Maimonides .
But these are not exactly my books .
I brought these books with me because they were written by my grandfather &apos;s favorite authors .
I mean literally every table , every chair in this apartment had yielded its original function to now serve as a surface for swaying stacks of books .
Just like the rest of my family , my grandfather &apos;s favorite thing to do in the whole world was to read .
But when he died at the age of 94 , the police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood to accommodate the crowd of people who came out to mourn him .
It was my version of my grandfather &apos;s hours of the day alone in his library .
But now all of a sudden my job is very different , and my job is to be out here talking about it , talking about introversion .
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s a lot harder for me , because as honored as I am to be here with all of you right now , this is not my natural milieu .
So I prepared for moments like these as best I could .
And I call this my &quot; &quot; year of speaking dangerously . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And that actually helped a lot .
And so I am going to leave you now with three calls for action for those who share this vision .
Number one : Stop the madness for constant group work .
Just stop it .
( Laughter ) Thank you .
It &apos;s great for introverts and it &apos;s great for extroverts .
We need to be teaching kids to work together , for sure , but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own .
Be like Buddha , have your own revelations .
So extroverts , maybe your suitcases are also full of books .
Whatever it is , I hope you take these things out every chance you get and grace us with your energy and your joy .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
One way to change our genes is to make new ones , as Craig Venter has so elegantly shown .
Another is to change our lifestyles .
And what we &apos;re learning is how powerful and dynamic these changes can be , that you don &apos;t have to wait very long to see the benefits .
When you eat healthier , manage stress , exercise and love more , your brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygen .
But more than that , your brain gets measurably bigger .
Things that were thought impossible just a few years ago can actually be measured now .
This was figured out by Robin Williams a few years before the rest of us .
Now , there &apos;s some things that you can do to make your brain grow new brain cells .
Some of my favorite things , like chocolate and tea , blueberries , alcohol in moderation , stress management and cannabinoids found in marijuana .
I &apos;m just the messenger .
( Laughter ) What were we just talking about ? ( Laughter )
And other things that can make it worse , that can cause you to lose brain cells .
The usual suspects , like saturated fat and sugar , nicotine , opiates , cocaine , too much alcohol and chronic stress .
Your skin gets more blood flow when you change your lifestyle , so you age less quickly . Your skin doesn &apos;t wrinkle as much .
Your heart gets more blood flow .
We &apos;ve shown that you can actually reverse heart disease .
That these clogged arteries that you see on the upper left , after only a year become measurably less clogged .
And the cardiac PET scan shown on the lower left , the blue means no blood flow .
A year later — orange and white is maximum blood flow .
We &apos;ve shown you may be able to stop and reverse the progression of early prostate cancer and , by extension , breast cancer , simply by making these changes .
We &apos;ve found that tumor growth in vitro was inhibited 70 percent in the group that made these changes , whereas only nine percent in the comparison group .
These differences were highly significant .
Even your sexual organs get more blood flow , so you increase sexual potency .
One of the most effective anti-smoking ads was done by the Department of Health Services , showing that nicotine , which constricts your arteries , can cause a heart attack or a stroke , but it also causes impotence .
Half of guys who smoke are impotent .
How sexy is that ?
Now we &apos;re also about to publish a study — the first study showing you can change gene expression in men with prostate cancer .
This is what &apos;s called a heat map — and the different colors — and along the side , on the right , are different genes .
And we found that over 500 genes were favorably changed — in effect , turning on the good genes , the disease-preventing genes , turning off the disease-promoting genes .
And so these findings I think are really very powerful , giving many people new hope and new choices .
And companies like Navigenics and DNA Direct and 23andMe , that are giving you your genetic profiles , are giving some people a sense of , &quot; &quot; Gosh , well , what can I do about it ? &quot; &quot; Well , our genes are not our fate , and if we make these changes — they &apos;re a predisposition — but if we make bigger changes than we might have made otherwise , we can actually change how our genes are expressed .
Thank you .

People say things about religion all the time .
( Laughter ) The late , great Christopher Hitchens wrote a book called &quot; &quot; God Is Not Great &quot; &quot; whose subtitle was , &quot; &quot; Religion Poisons Everything . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But last month , in Time magazine , Rabbi David Wolpe , who I gather is referred to as America &apos;s rabbi , said , to balance that against that negative characterization , that no important form of social change can be brought about except through organized religion .
Now , remarks of this sort on the negative and the positive side are very old .
I have one in my pocket here from the first century BCE by Lucretius , the author of &quot; &quot; On the Nature of Things , &quot; &quot; who said , &quot; &quot; Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum &quot; &quot; — I should have been able to learn that by heart — which is , that &apos;s how much religion is able to persuade people to do evil , and he was talking about the fact of Agamemnon &apos;s decision to place his daughter Iphigenia on an altar of sacrifice in order to preserve the prospects of his army .
So there have been these long debates over the centuries , in that case , actually , we can say over the millennia , about religion .
People have talked about it a lot , and they &apos;ve said good and bad and indifferent things about it .
What I want to persuade you of today is of a very simple claim , which is that these debates are in a certain sense preposterous , because there is no such thing as religion about which to make these claims .
There isn &apos;t a thing called religion , and so it can &apos;t be good or bad .
It can &apos;t even be indifferent .
And if you think about claims about the nonexistence of things , one obvious way to try and establish the nonexistence of a purported thing would be to offer a definition of that thing and then to see whether anything satisfied it .
I &apos;m going to start out on that little route to begin with .
So if you look in the dictionaries and if you think about it , one very natural definition of religion is that it involves belief in gods or in spiritual beings .
As I say , this is in many dictionaries , but you &apos;ll also find it actually in the work of Sir Edward Tylor , who was the first professor of anthropology at Oxford , one of the first modern anthropologists .
In his book on primitive culture , he says the heart of religion is what he called animism , that is , the belief in spiritual agency , belief in spirits .
The first problem for that definition is from a recent novel by Paul Beatty called &quot; &quot; Tuff . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a guy talking to a rabbi .
The rabbi says he doesn &apos;t believe in God .
The guy says , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re a rabbi , how can you not believe in God ? &quot; &quot; And the reply is , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s what &apos;s so great about being Jewish .
You don &apos;t have to believe in a God per se , just in being Jewish . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So if this guy is a rabbi , and a Jewish rabbi , and if you have to believe in God in order to be religious , then we have the rather counterintuitive conclusion that since it &apos;s possible to be a Jewish rabbi without believing in God , Judaism isn &apos;t a religion .
That seems like a pretty counterintuitive thought .
Here &apos;s another argument against this view .
A friend of mine , an Indian friend of mine , went to his grandfather when he was very young , a child , and said to him , &quot; I want to talk to you about religion , &quot; and his grandfather said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re too young .
His name is the Dalai Lama .
He often jokes that he &apos;s one of the world &apos;s leading atheists .
But it &apos;s true , because the Dalai Lama &apos;s religion does not involve belief in God .
Now you might think this just shows that I &apos;ve given you the wrong definition and that I should come up with some other definition and test it against these cases and try and find something that captures atheistic Judaism , atheistic Hinduism , and atheistic Buddhism as forms of religiosity , but I actually think that that &apos;s a bad idea , and the reason I think it &apos;s a bad idea is that I don &apos;t think that &apos;s how our concept of religion works .
I think the way our concept of religion works is that we actually have , we have a list of paradigm religions and their sub-parts , right , and if something new comes along that purports to be a religion , what we ask is , &quot; &quot; Well , is it like one of these ? &quot; &quot; Right ?
And I think that &apos;s not only how we think about religion , and that &apos;s , as it were , so from our point of view , anything on that list had better be a religion , which is why I don &apos;t think an account of religion that excludes Buddhism and Judaism has a chance of being a good starter , because they &apos;re on our list .
But why do we have such a list ?
What &apos;s going on ? How did it come about that we have this list ?
I think the answer is a pretty simple one and therefore crude and contentious .
I &apos;m sure a lot of people will disagree with it , but here &apos;s my story , and true or not , it &apos;s a story that I think gives you a good sense of how the list might have come about , and therefore helps you to think about what use the list might be .
I think the answer is , European travelers , starting roughly about the time of Columbus , started going around the world .
They came from a Christian culture , and when they arrived in a new place , they noticed that some people didn &apos;t have Christianity , and so they asked themselves the following question : what have they got instead of Christianity ?
And that list was essentially constructed .
It consists of the things that other people had instead of Christianity .
Now there &apos;s a difficulty with proceeding in that way , which is that Christianity is extremely , even on that list , it &apos;s an extremely specific tradition .
It has all kinds of things in it that are very , very particular that are the results of the specifics of Christian history , and one thing that &apos;s at the heart of it , one thing that &apos;s at the heart of most understandings of Christianity , which is the result of the specific history of Christianity , is that it &apos;s an extremely creedal religion .
It &apos;s a religion in which people are really concerned about whether you believe the right things .
The history of Christianity , the internal history of Christianity , is largely the history of people killing each other because they believed the wrong thing , and it &apos;s also involved in struggles with other religions , obviously starting in the Middle Ages , a struggle with Islam , in which , again , it was the infidelity , the fact that they didn &apos;t believe the right things , that seemed so offensive to the Christian world .
Now that &apos;s a very specific and particular history that Christianity has , and not everywhere is everything that has ever been put on this sort of list like it .
Here &apos;s another problem , I think .
A very specific thing happened .
It was actually adverted to earlier , but a very specific thing happened in the history of the kind of Christianity that we see around us mostly in the United States today , and it happened in the late 19th century , and that specific thing that happened in the late 19th century was a kind of deal that was cut between science , this new way of organizing intellectual authority , and religion .
If you think about the 18th century , say , if you think about intellectual life before the late 19th century , anything you did , anything you thought about , whether it was the physical world , the human world , the natural world apart from the human world , or morality , anything you did would have been framed against the background of a set of assumptions that were religious , Christian assumptions .
You couldn &apos;t give an account of the natural world that didn &apos;t say something about its relationship , for example , to the creation story in the Abrahamic tradition , the creation story in the first book of the Torah .
So everything was framed in that way .
But this changes in the late 19th century , and for the first time , it &apos;s possible for people to develop serious intellectual careers as natural historians like Darwin .
Darwin worried about the relationship between what he said and the truths of religion , but he could proceed , he could write books about his subject without having to say what the relationship was to the religious claims , and similarly , geologists increasingly could talk about it .
In the early 19th century , if you were a geologist and made a claim about the age of the Earth , you had to explain whether that was consistent or how it was or wasn &apos;t consistent with the age of the Earth implied by the account in Genesis .
By the end of the 19th century , you can just write a geology textbook in which you make arguments about how old the Earth is .
So there &apos;s a big change , and that division , that intellectual division of labor occurs as I say , I think , and it sort of solidifies so that by the end of the 19th century in Europe , there &apos;s a real intellectual division of labor , and you can do all sorts of serious things , including , increasingly , even philosophy , without being constrained by the thought , &quot; &quot; Well , what I have to say has to be consistent with the deep truths that are given to me by our religious tradition . &quot; &quot; So imagine someone who &apos;s coming out of that world , that late-19th-century world , coming into the country that I grew up in , Ghana ,
the society that I grew up in , Asante , coming into that world at the turn of the 20th century with this question that made the list : what have they got instead of Christianity ?
Well , here &apos;s one thing he would have noticed , and by the way , there was a person who actually did this .
His name was Captain Rattray , he was sent as the British government anthropologist , and he wrote a book about Asante religion .
This is a soul disc .
There are many of them in the British Museum .
I could give you an interesting , different history of how it comes about that many of the things from my society ended up in the British Museum , but we don &apos;t have time for that .
So this object is a soul disc .
What is a soul disc ?
It was worn around the necks of the soul-washers of the Asante king .
What was their job ? To wash the king &apos;s soul .
It would take a long while to explain how a soul could be the kind of thing that could be washed , but Rattray knew that this was religion because souls were in play .
And similarly , there were many other things , many other practices .
For example , every time anybody had a drink , more or less , they poured a little bit on the ground in what &apos;s called the libation , and they gave some to the ancestors .
My father did this . Every time he opened a bottle of whiskey , which I &apos;m glad to say was very often , he would take the top off and pour off just a little on the ground , and he would talk to , he would say to Akroma-Ampim , the founder of our line , or Yao Antony , my great uncle , he would talk to them , offer them a little bit of this .
And finally , there were these huge public ceremonials .
This is an early-19th-century drawing by another British military officer of such a ceremonial , where the king was involved , and the king &apos;s job , one of the large parts of his job , apart from organizing warfare and things like that , was to look after the tombs of his ancestors , and when a king died , the stool that he sat on was blackened and put in the royal ancestral temple , and every 40 days , the King of Asante has to go and do cult for his ancestors .
That &apos;s a large part of his job , and people think that if he doesn &apos;t do it , things will fall apart .
So he &apos;s a religious figure , as Rattray would have said , as well as a political figure .
So all this would count as religion for Rattray , but my point is that when you look into the lives of those people , you also find that every time they do anything , they &apos;re conscious of the ancestors .
Every morning at breakfast , you can go outside the front of the house and make an offering to the god tree , the nyame dua outside your house , and again , you &apos;ll talk to the gods and the high gods and the low gods and the ancestors and so on .
This is not a world in which the separation between religion and science has occurred .
Religion has not being separated from any other areas of life , and in particular , what &apos;s crucial to understand about this world is that it &apos;s a world in which the job that science does for us is done by what Rattray is going to call religion , because if they want an explanation of something , if they want to know why the crop just failed , if they want to know why it &apos;s raining or not raining , if they need rain , if they want to know why their grandfather has died , they are going to appeal to the very same entities , the very same language ,
talk to the very same gods about that .
This great separation , in other words , between religion and science hasn &apos;t happened .
Now , this would be a mere historical curiosity , except that in large parts of the world , this is still the truth .
I had the privilege of going to a wedding the other day in northern Namibia , 20 miles or so south of the Angolan border in a village of 200 people .
These were modern people .
We had with us Oona Chaplin , who some of you may have heard of , and one of the people from this village came up to her , and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen you in &apos; Game of Thrones . &apos; &quot; &quot; So these were not people who were isolated from our world , but nevertheless , for them , the gods and the spirits are still very much there , and when we were on the bus going back and forth to the various parts of the &#91; ceremony &#93; , they prayed not just in a generic way but for the safety of the journey , and they meant it , and when they said to me that my mother ,
the bridegroom &apos;s &#91; grandmother &#93; , was with us , they didn &apos;t mean it figuratively .
They meant , even though she was a dead person , they meant that she was still around .
So in large parts of the world today , that separation between science and religion hasn &apos;t occurred in large parts of the world today , and as I say , these are not — This guy used to work for Chase and at the World Bank .
These are fellow citizens of the world with you , but they come from a place in which religion is occupying a very different role .
So what I want you to think about next time somebody wants to make some vast generalization about religion is that maybe there isn &apos;t such a thing as a religion , such a thing as religion , and that therefore what they say cannot possibly be true .

The Value of Nothing : Out of Nothing Comes Something .
That was an essay I wrote when I was 11 years old and I got a B + . ( Laughter ) What I &apos;m going to talk about : nothing out of something , and how we create .
And I &apos;m gonna try and do that within the 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within , and to follow the TED commandments : that is , actually , something that creates a near-death experience , but near-death is good for creativity .
( Laughter ) OK .
So , I also want to explain , because Dave Eggers said he was going to heckle me if I said anything that was a lie , or not true to universal creativity .
And I &apos;ve done it this way for half the audience , who is scientific .
When I say we , I don &apos;t mean you , necessarily ; I mean me , and my right brain , my left brain and the one that &apos;s in between that is the censor and tells me what I &apos;m saying is wrong .
And I &apos;m going do that also by looking at what I think is part of my creative process , which includes a number of things that happened , actually — the nothing started even earlier than the moment in which I &apos;m creating something new .
And that includes nature , and nurture , and what I refer to as nightmares .
Now in the nature area , we look at whether or not we are innately equipped with something , perhaps in our brains , some abnormal chromosome that causes this muse-like effect .
And some people would say that we &apos;re born with it in some other means .
And others , like my mother , would say that I get my material from past lives .
Some people would also say that creativity may be a function of some other neurological quirk — van Gogh syndrome — that you have a little bit of , you know , psychosis , or depression .
I do have to say , somebody — I read recently that van Gogh wasn &apos;t really necessarily psychotic , that he might have had temporal lobe seizures , and that might have caused his spurt of creativity , and I don &apos;t — I suppose it does something in some part of your brain .
And I will mention that I actually developed temporal lobe seizures a number of years ago , but it was during the time I was writing my last book , and some people say that book is quite different .
I think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis : you know , who am I , why am I this particular person , why am I not black like everybody else ?
And sometimes you &apos;re equipped with skills , but they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity .
I used to draw . I thought I would be an artist .
And I had a miniature poodle .
And it wasn &apos;t bad , but it wasn &apos;t really creative .
Because all I could really do was represent in a very one-on-one way .
And I have a sense that I probably copied this from a book .
And then , I also wasn &apos;t really shining in a certain area that I wanted to be , and you know , you look at those scores , and it wasn &apos;t bad , but it was not certainly predictive that I would one day make my living out of the artful arrangement of words .
Also , one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma .
And I had the usual kind that I think a lot of people had , and that is that , you know , I had expectations placed on me .
That figure right there , by the way , figure right there was a toy given to me when I was but nine years old , and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age .
I have some ones that were long lasting : from the age of five to 15 , this was supposed to be my side occupation , and it led to a sense of failure .
But actually , there was something quite real in my life that happened when I was about 14 .
And it was discovered that my brother , in 1967 , and then my father , six months later , had brain tumors .
And my mother believed that something had gone wrong , and she was gonna find out what it was , and she was gonna fix it .
My father was a Baptist minister , and he believed in miracles , and that God &apos;s will would take care of that .
But , of course , they ended up dying , six months apart .
And after that , my mother believed that it was fate , or curses — she went looking through all the reasons in the universe why this would have happened .
Everything except randomness . She did not believe in randomness .
There was a reason for everything .
And one of the reasons , she thought , was that her mother , who had died when she was very young , was angry at her .
And so , I had this notion of death all around me , because my mother also believed that I would be next , and she would be next .
And when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon , you begin to think very much about everything .
You become very creative , in a survival sense .
And this , then , led to my big questions .
And they &apos;re the same ones that I have today .
And they are : why do things happen , and how do things happen ?
And the one my mother asked : how do I make things happen ?
It &apos;s a wonderful way to look at these questions , when you write a story .
Because , after all , in that framework , between page one and 300 , you have to answer this question of why things happen , how things happen , in what order they happen . What are the influences ?
How do I , as the narrator , as the writer , also influence that ?
And it &apos;s also one that , I think , many of our scientists have been asking .
It &apos;s a kind of cosmology , and I have to develop a cosmology of my own universe , as the creator of that universe .
And you see , there &apos;s a lot of back and forth in trying to make that happen , trying to figure it out — years and years , oftentimes .
So , when I look at creativity , I also think that it is this sense or this inability to repress , my looking at associations in practically anything in life .
And I got a lot of them during what &apos;s been going on throughout this conference , almost everything that &apos;s been going on .
And so I &apos;m going to use , as the metaphor , this association : quantum mechanics , which I really don &apos;t understand , but I &apos;m still gonna use it as the process for explaining how it is the metaphor .
So , in quantum mechanics , of course , you have dark energy and dark matter .
And it &apos;s the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen .
There &apos;s a lot of unknown , and you often don &apos;t know what it is except by its absence .
But when you make those associations , you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story , and what you &apos;re finding is what matters . The meaning .
And that &apos;s what I look for in my work , a personal meaning .
There is also the uncertainty principle , which is part of quantum mechanics , as I understand it . ( Laughter ) And this happens constantly in the writing .
And there &apos;s the terrible and dreaded observer effect , in which you &apos;re looking for something , and you know , things are happening simultaneously , and you &apos;re looking at it in a different way , and you &apos;re trying to really look for the about-ness , or what is this story about . And if you try too hard , then you will only write the about .
You won &apos;t discover anything .
And what you were supposed to find , what you hoped to find in some serendipitous way , is no longer there .
Now , I don &apos;t want to ignore the other side of what happens in our universe , like many of our scientists have .
And so , I am going to just throw in string theory here , and just say that creative people are multidimensional , and there are 11 levels , I think , of anxiety .
( Laughter ) And they all operate at the same time .
There is also a big question of ambiguity .
And I would link that to something called the cosmological constant .
And you don &apos;t know what is operating , but something is operating there .
And ambiguity , to me , is very uncomfortable in my life , and I have it . Moral ambiguity .
It is constantly there . And , just as an example , this is one that recently came to me .
It was something I read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in Iraq . And she said , &quot; Save a man from drowning , you are responsible to him for life . &quot;
A very famous Chinese saying , she said .
And that means because we went into Iraq , we should stay there until things were solved . You know , maybe even 100 years .
So , there was another one that I came across , and it &apos;s &quot; &quot; saving fish from drowning . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s what Buddhist fishermen say , because they &apos;re not supposed to kill anything .
And they also have to make a living , and people need to be fed .
So their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning , and unfortunately , in the process the fish die .
Now , what &apos;s encapsulated in both these drowning metaphors — actually , one of them is my mother &apos;s interpretation , and it is a famous Chinese saying , because she said it to me : &quot; save a man from drowning , you are responsible to him for life . &quot;
And it was a warning — don &apos;t get involved in other people &apos;s business , or you &apos;re going to get stuck .
OK . I think if somebody really was drowning , she &apos;d save them .
But , both of these sayings — saving a fish from drowning , or saving a man from drowning — to me they had to do with intentions .
And all of us in life , when we see a situation , we have a response .
And then we have intentions .
There &apos;s an ambiguity of what that should be that we should do , and then we do something .
And the results of that may not match what our intentions had been .
Maybe things go wrong . And so , after that , what are our responsibilities ?
What are we supposed to do ?
Do we stay in for life , or do we do something else and justify and say , well , my intentions were good , and therefore I cannot be held responsible for all of it ?
That is the ambiguity in my life that really disturbed me , and led me to write a book called &quot; Saving Fish From Drowning . &quot;
I saw examples of that . Once I identified this question , it was all over the place .
I got these hints everywhere .
And then , in a way , I knew that they had always been there .
And then writing , that &apos;s what happens . I get these hints , these clues , and I realize that they &apos;ve been obvious , and yet they have not been .
And what I need , in effect , is a focus .
And when I have the question , it is a focus .
And all these things that seem to be flotsam and jetsam in life actually go through that question , and what happens is those particular things become relevant .
And it seems like it &apos;s happening all the time .
You think there &apos;s a sort of coincidence going on , a serendipity , in which you &apos;re getting all this help from the universe .
And it may also be explained that now you have a focus .
And you are noticing it more often .
But you apply this .
You begin to look at things having to do with your tensions .
Your brother , who &apos;s fallen in trouble , do you take care of him ?
Why or why not ?
It may be something that is perhaps more serious — as I said , human rights in Burma .
I was thinking that I shouldn &apos;t go because somebody said , if I did , it would show that I approved of the military regime there .
And then , after a while , I had to ask myself , &quot; &quot; Why do we take on knowledge , why do we take on assumptions that other people have given us ? &quot; &quot; And it was the same thing that I felt when I was growing up , and was hearing these rules of moral conduct from my father , who was a Baptist minister .
So I decided that I would go to Burma for my own intentions , and still didn &apos;t know that if I went there , what the result of that would be , if I wrote a book — and I just would have to face that later , when the time came .
We are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of .
We come to this point and say , what do I as an individual do ?
Not all of us can go to Africa , or work at hospitals , so what do we do , if we have this moral response , this feeling ?
Also , I think one of the biggest things we are all looking at , and we talked about today , is genocide .
This leads to this question .
When I look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable , and I consider what my intentions should be , I realize it goes back to this identity question that I had when I was a child — and why am I here , and what is the meaning of my life , and what is my place in the universe ?
It seems so obvious , and yet it is not .
We all hate moral ambiguity in some sense , and yet it is also absolutely necessary .
In writing a story , it is the place where I begin .
Sometimes I get help from the universe , it seems .
My mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book , because it seemed I knew things I was not supposed to know .
Instead of writing that the grandmother died accidentally , from an overdose of opium , while having too much of a good time , I actually put down in the story that the woman killed herself , and that actually was the way it happened .
And my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother .
There are also things , quite uncanny , which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book .
In this case , I was writing a story that included some kind of detail , period of history , a certain location .
And I needed to find something historically that would match that .
And I took down this book , and I — first page that I flipped it to was exactly the setting , and the time period , and the kind of character I needed — was the Taiping rebellion , happening in the area near Guilin , outside of that , and a character who thought he was the son of God .
You wonder , are these things random chance ?
Well , what is random ? What is chance ? What is luck ?
What are things that you get from the universe that you can &apos;t really explain ?
And that goes into the story , too .
These are the things I constantly think about from day to day .
Especially when good things happen , and , in particular , when bad things happen .
But I do think there &apos;s a kind of serendipity , and I do want to know what those elements are , so I can thank them , and also try to find them in my life .
Because , again , I think that when I am aware of them , more of them happen .
Another chance encounter is when I went to a place — I just was with some friends , and we drove randomly to a different place , and we ended up in this non-tourist location , a beautiful village , pristine .
And we walked three valleys beyond , and the third valley , there was something quite mysterious and ominous , a discomfort I felt . And then I knew that had to be &#91; the &#93; setting of my book .
And in writing one of the scenes , it happened in that third valley .
For some reason I wrote about cairns — stacks of rocks — that a man was building .
And I didn &apos;t know exactly why I had it , but it was so vivid .
I got stuck , and a friend , when she asked if I would go for a walk with her dogs , that I said , sure . And about 45 minutes later , walking along the beach , I came across this .
And it was a man , a Chinese man , and he was stacking these things , not with glue , not with anything .
And I asked him , &quot; &quot; How is it possible to do this ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I guess with everything in life , there &apos;s a place of balance . &quot; &quot; And this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point .
I had so many examples — I have so many instances like this , when I &apos;m writing a story , and I cannot explain it .
Is it because I had the filter that I have such a strong coincidence in writing about these things ?
Or is it a kind of serendipity that we cannot explain , like the cosmological constant ?
A big thing that I also think about is accidents .
And as I said , my mother did not believe in randomness .
What is the nature of accidents ?
And how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are , outside of a court of law ?
I was able to see that in a firsthand way , when I went to beautiful Dong village , in Guizhou , the poorest province of China .
And I saw this beautiful place . I knew I wanted to come back .
And I had a chance to do that , when National Geographic asked me if I wanted to write anything about China .
And I said yes , about this village of singing people , singing minority .
And they agreed , and between the time I saw this place and the next time I went , there was a terrible accident . A man , an old man , fell asleep , and his quilt dropped in a pan of fire that kept him warm .
60 homes were destroyed , and 40 were damaged .
Responsibility was assigned to the family .
The man &apos;s sons were banished to live three kilometers away , in a cowshed .
And , of course , as Westerners , we say , &quot; &quot; Well , it was an accident . That &apos;s not fair .
It &apos;s the son , not the father . &quot; &quot; When I go on a story , I have to let go of those kinds of beliefs .
It takes a while , but I have to let go of them and just go there , and be there .
And so I was there on three occasions , different seasons .
And I began to sense something different about the history , and what had happened before , and the nature of life in a very poor village , and what you find as your joys , and your rituals , your traditions , your links with other families . And I saw how this had a kind of justice , in its responsibility .
I was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using , a ceremony they hadn &apos;t used in about 29 years . And it was to send some men — a Feng Shui master sent men down to the underworld on ghost horses .
Now you , as Westerners , and I , as Westerners , would say well , that &apos;s superstition . But after being there for a while , and seeing the amazing things that happened , you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world , determining how things happen .
So I remained with them , and the more I wrote that story , the more I got into those beliefs , and I think that &apos;s important for me — to take on the beliefs , because that is where the story is real , and that is where I &apos;m gonna find the answers to how I feel about certain questions that I have in life .
Years go by , of course , and the writing , it doesn &apos;t happen instantly , as I &apos;m trying to convey it to you here at TED .
The book comes and it goes . When it arrives , it is no longer my book .
It is in the hands of readers , and they interpret it differently .
But I go back to this question of , how do I create something out of nothing ?
And how do I create my own life ?
And I think it is by questioning , and saying to myself that there are no absolute truths .
I believe in specifics , the specifics of story , and the past , the specifics of that past , and what is happening in the story at that point .
I also believe that in thinking about things — my thinking about luck , and fate , and coincidences and accidents , God &apos;s will , and the synchrony of mysterious forces — I will come to some notion of what that is , how we create .
I have to think of my role . Where I am in the universe , and did somebody intend for me to be that way , or is it just something I came up with ?
And I also can find that by imagining fully , and becoming what is imagined — and yet is in that real world , the fictional world .
And that is how I find particles of truth , not the absolute truth , or the whole truth .
And they have to be in all possibilities , including those I never considered before .
So , there are never complete answers .
Or rather , if there is an answer , it is to remind myself that there is uncertainty in everything , and that is good , because then I will discover something new .
And if there is a partial answer , a more complete answer from me , it is to simply imagine .
And to imagine is to put myself in that story , until there was only — there is a transparency between me and the story that I am creating .
And that &apos;s how I &apos;ve discovered that if I feel what is in the story — in one story — then I come the closest , I think , to knowing what compassion is , to feeling that compassion .
Because for everything , in that question of how things happen , it has to do with the feeling .
I have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that .
We &apos;ve come to the end of the talk , and I will reveal what is in the bag , and it is the muse , and it is the things that transform in our lives , that are wonderful and stay with us .
There she is .
Thank you very much !

Just a moment ago , my daughter Rebecca texted me for good luck .
Her text said , &quot; Mom , you will rock . &quot;
I love this .
Getting that text was like getting a hug .
And so there you have it .
I embody the central paradox .
I &apos;m a woman who loves getting texts who &apos;s going to tell you that too many of them can be a problem .
Actually that reminder of my daughter brings me to the beginning of my story .
1996 , when I gave my first TEDTalk , Rebecca was five years old and she was sitting right there in the front row .
We were exploring different aspects of ourselves .
And then we unplugged .
I was excited .
Now fast-forward to 2012 .
I &apos;m back here on the TED stage again .
They text and shop and go on Facebook during classes , during presentations , actually during all meetings .
And we even text at funerals .
People want to be with each other , but also elsewhere — connected to all the different places they want to be .
People want to customize their lives .
So you want to go to that board meeting , but you only want to pay attention to the bits that interest you .
And some people think that &apos;s a good thing .
And he says he doesn &apos;t want to interrupt his colleagues because , he says , &quot; &quot; They &apos;re too busy on their email . &quot; &quot; But then he stops himself and he says , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not telling you the truth .
I &apos;m the one who doesn &apos;t want to be interrupted .
People say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s wrong with having a conversation .
And over time , we seem to forget this , or we seem to stop caring .
He said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t all those little tweets , don &apos;t all those little sips of online communication , add up to one big gulp of real conversation ? &quot; &quot; My answer was no , they don &apos;t add up .
And what I &apos;m seeing is that people get so used to being short-changed out of real conversation , so used to getting by with less , that they &apos;ve become almost willing to dispense with people altogether .
That feeling that no one is listening to me is very important in our relationships with technology .
And the feeling that no one is listening to me make us want to spend time with machines that seem to care about us .
It seemed to be looking in her eyes .
And many people found this amazing .
That robot put on a great show .
And I believe it &apos;s because technology appeals to us most where we are most vulnerable .
Being alone feels like a problem that needs to be solved .
And so people try to solve it by connecting .
But more than a symptom , constant connection is changing the way people think of themselves .
Now it &apos;s : I want to have a feeling , I need to send a text .
How do you get from connection to isolation ?
If we &apos;re not able to be alone , we &apos;re going to be more lonely .
And we &apos;re afraid , like young lovers , that too much talking might spoil the romance .
Make room for it .

I have given the slide show that I gave here two years ago about 2,000 times .
I &apos;m giving a short slide show this morning that I &apos;m giving for the very first time , so — well it &apos;s — I don &apos;t want or need to raise the bar , I &apos;m actually trying to lower the bar .
Because I &apos;ve cobbled this together to try to meet the challenge of this session .
And I was reminded by Karen Armstrong &apos;s fantastic presentation that religion really properly understood is not about belief , but about behavior .
Perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism .
How dare we be optimistic ?
Optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief , an intellectual posture .
As Mahatma Gandhi famously said , &quot; You must become the change you wish to see in the world . &quot;
And the outcome about which we wish to be optimistic is not going to be created by the belief alone , except to the extent that the belief brings about new behavior . But the word &quot; &quot; behavior &quot; &quot; is also , I think , sometimes misunderstood in this context .
I &apos;m a big advocate of changing the lightbulbs and buying hybrids , and Tipper and I put 33 solar panels on our house , and dug the geothermal wells , and did all of that other stuff .
But , as important as it is to change the lightbulbs , it is more important to change the laws .
And when we change our behavior in our daily lives , we sometimes leave out the citizenship part and the democracy part . In order to be optimistic about this , we have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracy .
In order to solve the climate crisis , we have to solve the democracy crisis .
And we have one .
I have been trying to tell this story for a long time .
I was reminded of that recently , by a woman who walked past the table I was sitting at , just staring at me as she walked past . She was in her 70s , looked like she had a kind face . I thought nothing of it until I saw from the corner of my eye she was walking from the opposite direction , also just staring at me . And so I said , &quot; &quot; How do you do ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; You know , if you dyed your hair black , you would look just like Al Gore . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Many years ago , when I was a young congressman , I spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge
of nuclear arms control — the nuclear arms race .
And the military historians taught me , during that quest , that military conflicts are typically put into three categories : local battles , regional or theater wars , and the rare but all-important global , world war — strategic conflicts .
And each level of conflict requires a different allocation of resources , a different approach , a different organizational model .
Environmental challenges fall into the same three categories , and most of what we think about are local environmental problems : air pollution , water pollution , hazardous waste dumps . But there are also regional environmental problems , like acid rain from the Midwest to the Northeast , and from Western Europe to the Arctic , and from the Midwest out the Mississippi into the dead zone of the Gulf of Mexico .
And there are lots of those . But the climate crisis is the rare but all-important global , or strategic , conflict .
Everything is affected . And we have to organize our response appropriately . We need a worldwide , global mobilization for renewable energy , conservation , efficiency and a global transition to a low-carbon economy .
We have work to do . And we can mobilize resources and political will . But the political will has to be mobilized , in order to mobilize the resources .
Let me show you these slides here .
I thought I would start with the logo . What &apos;s missing here , of course , is the North Polar ice cap .
Greenland remains . Twenty-eight years ago , this is what the polar ice cap — the North Polar ice cap — looked like at the end of the summer , at the fall equinox .
This last fall , I went to the Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder , Colorado , and talked to the researchers here in Monterey at the Naval Postgraduate Laboratory .
This is what &apos;s happened in the last 28 years .
To put it in perspective , 2005 was the previous record .
Here &apos;s what happened last fall that has really unnerved the researchers .
The North Polar ice cap is the same size geographically — doesn &apos;t look quite the same size — but it is exactly the same size as the United States , minus an area roughly equal to the state of Arizona .
The amount that disappeared in 2005 was equivalent to everything east of the Mississippi .
The extra amount that disappeared last fall was equivalent to this much . It comes back in the winter , but not as permanent ice , as thin ice — vulnerable . The amount remaining could be completely gone in summer in as little as five years .
That puts a lot of pressure on Greenland .
Already , around the Arctic Circle — this is a famous village in Alaska . This is a town in Newfoundland . Antarctica . Latest studies from NASA .
The amount of a moderate-to-severe snow melting of an area equivalent to the size of California .
&quot; &quot; They were the best of times , they were the worst of times &quot; &quot; : the most famous opening sentence in English literature . I want to share briefly a tale of two planets . Earth and Venus are exactly the same size . Earth &apos;s diameter is about 400 kilometers larger , but essentially the same size .
They have exactly the same amount of carbon .
But the difference is , on Earth , most of the carbon has been leeched over time out of the atmosphere , deposited in the ground as coal , oil , natural gas , etc . On Venus , most of it is in the atmosphere . The difference is that our temperature is 59 degrees on average . On Venus , it &apos;s 855 . This is relevant to our current strategy of taking as much carbon out of the ground as quickly as possible , and putting it into the atmosphere .
It &apos;s not because Venus is slightly closer to the Sun .
It &apos;s three times hotter than Mercury , which is right next to the Sun . Now , briefly , here &apos;s an image you &apos;ve seen , as one of the only old images , but I show it because I want to briefly give you CSI : Climate .
The global scientific community says : man-made global warming pollution , put into the atmosphere , thickening this , is trapping more of the outgoing infrared .
You all know that . At the last IPCC summary , the scientists wanted to say , &quot; How certain are you ? &quot; They wanted to answer that &quot; 99 percent . &quot;
The Chinese objected , and so the compromise was &quot; more than 90 percent . &quot;
Now , the skeptics say , &quot; &quot; Oh , wait a minute , this could be variations in this energy coming in from the sun . &quot; &quot; If that were true , the stratosphere would be heated as well as the lower atmosphere , if it &apos;s more coming in .
If it &apos;s more being trapped on the way out , then you would expect it to be warmer here and cooler here . Here is the lower atmosphere .
Here &apos;s the stratosphere : cooler .
CSI : Climate .
Now , here &apos;s the good news . Sixty-eight percent of Americans now believe that human activity is responsible for global warming . Sixty-nine percent believe that the Earth is heating up in a significant way . There has been progress , but here is the key : when given a list of challenges to confront , global warming is still listed at near the bottom .
What is missing is a sense of urgency .
If you agree with the factual analysis , but you don &apos;t feel the sense of urgency , where does that leave you ?
Well , the Alliance for Climate Protection , which I head in conjunction with Current TV — who did this pro bono — did a worldwide contest to do commercials on how to communicate this .
This is the winner .
NBC — I &apos;ll show all of the networks here — the top journalists for NBC asked 956 questions in 2007 of the presidential candidates : two of them were about the climate crisis . ABC : 844 questions , two about the climate crisis .
Fox : two . CNN : two . CBS : zero .
From laughs to tears — this is one of the older tobacco commercials .
So here &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
This is gasoline consumption in all of these countries . And us .
But it &apos;s not just the developed nations .
The developing countries are now following us and accelerating their pace . And actually , their cumulative emissions this year are the equivalent to where we were in 1965 . And they &apos;re catching up very dramatically . The total concentrations : by 2025 , they will be essentially where we were in 1985 .
If the wealthy countries were completely missing from the picture , we would still have this crisis .
But we have given to the developing countries the technologies and the ways of thinking that are creating the crisis . This is in Bolivia — over thirty years .
This is peak fishing in a few seconds . The &apos; 60s .
&apos;70s . &apos; 80s . &apos; 90s . We have to stop this . And the good news is that we can .
We have the technologies .
We have to have a unified view of how to go about this : the struggle against poverty in the world and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions , all has a single , very simple solution .
People say , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the solution ? &quot; &quot; Here it is .
Put a price on carbon . We need a CO2 tax , revenue neutral , to replace taxation on employment , which was invented by Bismarck — and some things have changed since the 19th century .
In the poor world , we have to integrate the responses to poverty with the solutions to the climate crisis .
Plans to fight poverty in Uganda are mooted , if we do not solve the climate crisis .
But responses can actually make a huge difference in the poor countries . This is a proposal that has been talked about a lot in Europe .
This was from Nature magazine . These are concentrating solar , renewable energy plants , linked in a so-called &quot; &quot; supergrid &quot; &quot; to supply all of the electrical power to Europe , largely from developing countries — high-voltage DC currents .
This is not pie in the sky ; this can be done .
We need to do it for our own economy .
The latest figures show that the old model is not working . There are a lot of great investments that you can make . If you are investing in tar sands or shale oil , then you have a portfolio that is crammed with sub-prime carbon assets .
And it is based on an old model .
Junkies find veins in their toes when the ones in their arms and their legs collapse . Developing tar sands and coal shale is the equivalent . Here are just a few of the investments that I personally think make sense .
I have a stake in these , so I &apos;ll have a disclaimer there .
But geothermal , concentrating solar , advanced photovoltaics , efficiency and conservation .
You &apos;ve seen this slide before , but there &apos;s a change .
The only two countries that didn &apos;t ratify — and now there &apos;s only one . Australia had an election .
And there was a campaign in Australia that involved television and Internet and radio commercials to lift the sense of urgency for the people there .
And we trained 250 people to give the slide show in every town and village and city in Australia .
Lot of other things contributed to it , but the new Prime Minister announced that his very first priority would be to change Australia &apos;s position on Kyoto , and he has . Now , they came to an awareness partly because of the horrible drought that they have had .
This is Lake Lanier . My friend Heidi Cullen said that if we gave droughts names the way we give hurricanes names , we &apos;d call the one in the southeast now Katrina , and we would say it &apos;s headed toward Atlanta .
We can &apos;t wait for the kind of drought Australia had to change our political culture .
Here &apos;s more good news . The cities supporting Kyoto in the U.S.
are up to 780 — and I thought I saw one go by there , just to localize this — which is good news .
Now , to close , we heard a couple of days ago about the value of making individual heroism so commonplace that it becomes banal or routine .
What we need is another hero generation . Those of us who are alive in the United States of America today especially , but also the rest of the world , have to somehow understand that history has presented us with a choice — just as Jill &#91; Bolte &#93; Taylor was figuring out how to save her life while she was distracted by the amazing experience that she was going through .
We now have a culture of distraction .
But we have a planetary emergency .
And we have to find a way to create , in the generation of those alive today , a sense of generational mission .
I wish I could find the words to convey this .
This was another hero generation that brought democracy to the planet .
Another that ended slavery . And that gave women the right to vote .
We can do this . Don &apos;t tell me that we don &apos;t have the capacity to do it .
If we had just one week &apos;s worth of what we spend on the Iraq War , we could be well on the way to solving this challenge .
We have the capacity to do it .
One final point : I &apos;m optimistic , because I believe we have the capacity , at moments of great challenge , to set aside the causes of distraction and rise to the challenge that history is presenting to us .
Sometimes I hear people respond to the disturbing facts of the climate crisis by saying , &quot; &quot; Oh , this is so terrible .
What a burden we have . &quot; &quot; I would like to ask you to reframe that . How many generations in all of human history have had the opportunity to rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best efforts ?
A challenge that can pull from us more than we knew we could do ? I think we ought to approach this challenge with a sense of profound joy and gratitude that we are the generation about which , a thousand years from now , philharmonic orchestras and poets and singers will celebrate by saying , they were the ones that found it within themselves to solve this crisis and lay the basis for a bright and optimistic human future .
Let &apos;s do that . Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : For so many people at TED , there is deep pain that basically a design issue on a voting form — one bad design issue meant that your voice wasn &apos;t being heard like that in the last eight years in a position where you could make these things come true .
That hurts .
Al Gore : You have no idea . ( Laughter ) CA : When you look at what the leading candidates in your own party are doing now — I mean , there &apos;s — are you excited by their plans on global warming ?
AG : The answer to the question is hard for me because , on the one hand , I think that we should feel really great about the fact that the Republican nominee — certain nominee — John McCain , and both of the finalists for the Democratic nomination — all three have a very different and forward-leaning position on the climate crisis . All three have offered leadership , and all three are very different from the approach taken by the current administration . And I think that all three have also been responsible in putting forward plans and proposals . But the campaign dialogue that — as illustrated by the questions —
that was put together by the League of Conservation Voters , by the way , the analysis of all the questions — and , by the way , the debates have all been sponsored by something that goes by the Orwellian label , &quot; &quot; Clean Coal . &quot; &quot; Has anybody noticed that ?
Every single debate has been sponsored by &quot; &quot; Clean Coal . &quot; &quot; &quot; Now , even lower emissions ! &quot;
The richness and fullness of the dialogue in our democracy has not laid the basis for the kind of bold initiative that is really needed .
So they &apos;re saying the right things and they may — whichever of them is elected — may do the right thing , but let me tell you : when I came back from Kyoto in 1997 , with a feeling of great happiness that we &apos;d gotten that breakthrough there , and then confronted the United States Senate , only one out of 100 senators was willing to vote to confirm , to ratify that treaty . Whatever the candidates say has to be laid alongside what the people say .
This challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization .
CO2 is the exhaling breath of our civilization , literally .
And now we mechanized that process . Changing that pattern requires a scope , a scale , a speed of change that is beyond what we have done in the past .
So that &apos;s why I began by saying , be optimistic in what you do , but be an active citizen .
Demand — change the light bulbs , but change the laws . Change the global treaties .
We have to speak up . We have to solve this democracy — this — We have sclerosis in our democracy . And we have to change that .
Use the Internet . Go on the Internet .
Connect with people . Become very active as citizens .
Have a moratorium — we shouldn &apos;t have any new coal-fired generating plants that aren &apos;t able to capture and store CO2 , which means we have to quickly build these renewable sources .
Now , nobody is talking on that scale . But I do believe that between now and November , it is possible .
This Alliance for Climate Protection is going to launch a nationwide campaign — grassroots mobilization , television ads , Internet ads , radio , newspaper — with partnerships with everybody from the Girl Scouts to the hunters and fishermen .
We need help . We need help .
CA : In terms of your own personal role going forward , Al , is there something more than that you would like to be doing ?
AG : I have prayed that I would be able to find the answer to that question . What can I do ?
Buckminster Fuller once wrote , &quot; &quot; If the future of all human civilization depended on me , what would I do ?
How would I be ? &quot; &quot; It does depend on all of us , but again , not just with the light bulbs .
We , most of us here , are Americans . We have a democracy .
We can change things , but we have to actively change .
What &apos;s needed really is a higher level of consciousness .
And that &apos;s hard to — that &apos;s hard to create — but it is coming .
There &apos;s an old African proverb that some of you know that says , &quot; &quot; If you want to go quickly , go alone ; if you want to go far , go together . &quot; &quot; We have to go far , quickly .
So we have to have a change in consciousness .
A change in commitment . A new sense of urgency .
A new appreciation for the privilege that we have of undertaking this challenge .
CA : Al Gore , thank you so much for coming to TED .
AG : Thank you . Thank you very much .
So , people are more afraid of insects than they are of dying .
Only heights and public speaking exceeded the six-legged as sources of fear .
And I suspect if you had put spiders in there , the combinations of insects and spiders would have just topped the chart .
Now , I am not one of those people .
I really love insects .
I think they &apos;re interesting and beautiful , and sometimes even cute .
Well , why is that ?
What is that keeps us coming back to insects ?
Some of it , of course , is just the sheer magnitude of almost everything about them .
They &apos;re more numerous than any other kind of animal .
We don &apos;t even know how many species of insects there are , because new ones are being discovered all the time .
There are at least a million , maybe as many as 10 million .
This means that you could have an insect-of-the-month calendar and not have to reuse a species for over 80,000 years .
More seriously , insects are essential .
We need them .
It &apos;s been estimated that 1 out of every 3 bites of food is made possible by a pollinator .
Scientist use insects to make fundamental discoveries about everything from the structure of our nervous systems to how our genes and DNA work .
Insects seem like they do everything that people do .
And they do so with what looks like love or animosity .
But what drives their behaviors is really different than what drives our own , and that difference can be really illuminating .
There &apos;s nowhere where that &apos;s more true than when it comes to one of our most consuming interests — sex .
Now , I will maintain. and I think I can defend , what may seem like a surprising statement .
Of course , to start with , a lot of insects don &apos;t need to have sex at all to reproduce .
Female aphids can make little , tiny clones of themselves without ever mating .
Virgin birth , right there .
On your rose bushes .
There are some kinds of fruit flies whose sperm is longer than the male &apos;s own body .
And that &apos;s important because the males use their sperm to compete .
Now , male insects do compete with weapons , like the horns on these beetles .
But they also compete after mating with their sperm .
Dragonflies and damselflies have penises that look kind of like Swiss Army knives with all of the attachments pulled out .
( Laughter ) They use these formidable devices like scoops , to remove the sperm from previous males that the female has mated with . ( Laughter )
So , what can we learn from this ? ( Laughter )
All right , it is not a lesson in the sense of us imitating them or of them setting an example for us to follow .
Which , given this , is probably just as well .
And also , did I mention sexual cannibalism is rampant among insects ?
So , no , that &apos;s not the point .
So , people have this idea that nature dictates kind of a 1950s sitcom version of what males and females are like .
So that males are always supposed to be dominant and aggressive , and females are passive and coy .
But that &apos;s just not the case .
So for example , take katydids , which are relatives of crickets and grasshoppers .
But it also means that the males are very passive about mating , whereas the females are extremely aggressive and competitive , in an attempt to get as many of these nutritious nuptial gifts as they can .
So , it &apos;s not exactly a stereotypical set of rules .
People have had a hard time getting their head around that idea for millennia .
Aristotle tried to get involved as well .
Well , what difference does this make ?
And the idea is that what &apos;s true for a person will also be true for the white rat .
And by and large , that turns out to be the case .
But you can take the idea of a model system too far .
And what I think we &apos;ve done , is use males , in any species , as though they are the model system .
The norm .
The way things are supposed to be .
And so , back to the insects .
Because they assumed that the world &apos;s stage was largely occupied by male players and females would only have minor , walk-on roles .
But when we do that , we really miss out on a lot of what nature is like .
And we can also miss out on the way natural , living things , including people , can vary .
They have little , tiny brains with very little cognitive ability , the way we normally think of it .
They have complicated behavior , but they lack complicated brains .
I really love that it &apos;s difficult to anthropomorphize insects , to look at them and just think of them like they &apos;re little people in exoskeletons , with six legs .
Now , you know , people write fiction and talk about parallel universes .
They speculate about the supernatural , maybe the spirits of the departed walking among us .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Well , I have a big announcement to make today , and I &apos;m really excited about this .
And this may be a little bit of a surprise to many of you who know my research and what I &apos;ve done well .
I &apos;ve really tried to solve some big problems : counterterrorism , nuclear terrorism , and health care and diagnosing and treating cancer , but I started thinking about all these problems , and I realized that the really biggest problem we face , what all these other problems come down to , is energy , is electricity , the flow of electrons .
And I decided that I was going to set out to try to solve this problem .
And this probably is not what you &apos;re expecting .
You &apos;re probably expecting me to come up here and talk about fusion , because that &apos;s what I &apos;ve done most of my life .
But this is actually a talk about , okay — ( Laughter ) — but this is actually a talk about fission .
It &apos;s about perfecting something old , and bringing something old into the 21st century .
Let &apos;s talk a little bit about how nuclear fission works .
In a nuclear power plant , you have a big pot of water that &apos;s under high pressure , and you have some fuel rods , and these fuel rods are encased in zirconium , and they &apos;re little pellets of uranium dioxide fuel , and a fission reaction is controlled and maintained at a proper level , and that reaction heats up water , the water turns to steam , steam turns the turbine , and you produce electricity from it .
This is the same way we &apos;ve been producing electricity , the steam turbine idea , for 100 years , and nuclear was a really big advancement in a way to heat the water , but you still boil water and that turns to steam and turns the turbine .
And I thought , you know , is this the best way to do it ?
Is fission kind of played out , or is there something left to innovate here ?
And I realized that I had hit upon something that I think has this huge potential to change the world .
And this is what it is .
This is a small modular reactor .
So it &apos;s not as big as the reactor you see in the diagram here .
This is between 50 and 100 megawatts .
But that &apos;s a ton of power .
That &apos;s between , say at an average use , that &apos;s maybe 25,000 to 100,000 homes could run off that .
Now the really interesting thing about these reactors is they &apos;re built in a factory .
So they &apos;re modular reactors that are built essentially on an assembly line , and they &apos;re trucked anywhere in the world , you plop them down , and they produce electricity .
This region right here is the reactor .
And this is buried below ground , which is really important .
For someone who &apos;s done a lot of counterterrorism work , I can &apos;t extol to you how great having something buried below the ground is for proliferation and security concerns .
And inside this reactor is a molten salt , so anybody who &apos;s a fan of thorium , they &apos;re going to be really excited about this , because these reactors happen to be really good at breeding and burning the thorium fuel cycle , uranium-233 .
But I &apos;m not really concerned about the fuel .
You can run these off — they &apos;re really hungry , they really like down-blended weapons pits , so that &apos;s highly enriched uranium and weapons-grade plutonium that &apos;s been down-blended .
It &apos;s made into a grade where it &apos;s not usable for a nuclear weapon , but they love this stuff .
And we have a lot of it sitting around , because this is a big problem .
You know , in the Cold War , we built up this huge arsenal of nuclear weapons , and that was great , and we don &apos;t need them anymore , and what are we doing with all the waste , essentially ?
What are we doing with all the pits of those nuclear weapons ?
Well , we &apos;re securing them , and it would be great if we could burn them , eat them up , and this reactor loves this stuff .
So it &apos;s a molten salt reactor . It has a core , and it has a heat exchanger from the hot salt , the radioactive salt , to a cold salt which isn &apos;t radioactive .
It &apos;s still thermally hot but it &apos;s not radioactive .
And then that &apos;s a heat exchanger to what makes this design really , really interesting , and that &apos;s a heat exchanger to a gas .
So going back to what I was saying before about all power being produced — well , other than photovoltaic — being produced by this boiling of steam and turning a turbine , that &apos;s actually not that efficient , and in fact , in a nuclear power plant like this , it &apos;s only roughly 30 to 35 percent efficient .
That &apos;s how much thermal energy the reactor &apos;s putting out to how much electricity it &apos;s producing .
And the reason the efficiencies are so low is these reactors operate at pretty low temperature .
They operate anywhere from , you know , maybe 200 to 300 degrees Celsius .
And these reactors run at 600 to 700 degrees Celsius , which means the higher the temperature you go to , thermodynamics tells you that you will have higher efficiencies .
And this reactor doesn &apos;t use water . It uses gas , so supercritical CO2 or helium , and that goes into a turbine , and this is called the Brayton cycle .
This is the thermodynamic cycle that produces electricity , and this makes this almost 50 percent efficient , between 45 and 50 percent efficiency .
And I &apos;m really excited about this , because it &apos;s a very compact core .
Molten salt reactors are very compact by nature , but what &apos;s also great is you get a lot more electricity out for how much uranium you &apos;re fissioning , not to mention the fact that these burn up .
Their burn-up is much higher .
So for a given amount of fuel you put in the reactor , a lot more of it &apos;s being used .
And the problem with a traditional nuclear power plant like this is , you &apos;ve got these rods that are clad in zirconium , and inside them are uranium dioxide fuel pellets .
Well , uranium dioxide &apos;s a ceramic , and ceramic doesn &apos;t like releasing what &apos;s inside of it .
So you have what &apos;s called the xenon pit , and so some of these fission products love neutrons .
They love the neutrons that are going on and helping this reaction take place .
And they eat them up , which means that , combined with the fact that the cladding doesn &apos;t last very long , you can only run one of these reactors for roughly , say , 18 months without refueling it .
So these reactors run for 30 years without refueling , which is , in my opinion , very , very amazing , because it means it &apos;s a sealed system .
No refueling means you can seal them up and they &apos;re not going to be a proliferation risk , and they &apos;re not going to have either nuclear material or radiological material proliferated from their cores .
But let &apos;s go back to safety , because everybody after Fukushima had to reassess the safety of nuclear , and one of the things when I set out to design a power reactor was it had to be passively and intrinsically safe , and I &apos;m really excited about this reactor for essentially two reasons .
One , it doesn &apos;t operate at high pressure .
So traditional reactors like a pressurized water reactor or boiling water reactor , they &apos;re very , very hot water at very high pressures , and this means , essentially , in the event of an accident , if you had any kind of breach of this stainless steel pressure vessel , the coolant would leave the core .
These reactors operate at essentially atmospheric pressure , so there &apos;s no inclination for the fission products to leave the reactor in the event of an accident .
Also , they operate at high temperatures , and the fuel is molten , so they can &apos;t melt down , but in the event that the reactor ever went out of tolerances , or you lost off-site power in the case of something like Fukushima , there &apos;s a dump tank .
Because your fuel is liquid , and it &apos;s combined with your coolant , you could actually just drain the core into what &apos;s called a sub-critical setting , basically a tank underneath the reactor that has some neutrons absorbers .
And this is really important , because the reaction stops .
In this kind of reactor , you can &apos;t do that .
The fuel , like I said , is ceramic inside zirconium fuel rods , and in the event of an accident in one of these type of reactors , Fukushima and Three Mile Island — looking back at Three Mile Island , we didn &apos;t really see this for a while — but these zirconium claddings on these fuel rods , what happens is , when they see high pressure water , steam , in an oxidizing environment , they &apos;ll actually produce hydrogen , and that hydrogen has this explosive capability to release fission products .
So the core of this reactor , since it &apos;s not under pressure and it doesn &apos;t have this chemical reactivity , means that there &apos;s no inclination for the fission products to leave this reactor .
So even in the event of an accident , yeah , the reactor may be toast , which is , you know , sorry for the power company , but we &apos;re not going to contaminate large quantities of land .
So I really think that in the , say , 20 years it &apos;s going to take us to get fusion and make fusion a reality , this could be the source of energy that provides carbon-free electricity .
Carbon-free electricity .
And it &apos;s an amazing technology because not only does it combat climate change , but it &apos;s an innovation .
It &apos;s a way to bring power to the developing world , because it &apos;s produced in a factory and it &apos;s cheap .
You can put them anywhere in the world you want to .
And maybe something else .
As a kid , I was obsessed with space .
Well , I was obsessed with nuclear science too , to a point , but before that I was obsessed with space , and I was really excited about , you know , being an astronaut and designing rockets , which was something that was always exciting to me .
But I think I get to come back to this , because imagine having a compact reactor in a rocket that produces 50 to 100 megawatts .
That is the rocket designer &apos;s dream .
That &apos;s someone who is designing a habitat on another planet &apos;s dream .
Not only do you have 50 to 100 megawatts to power whatever you want to provide propulsion to get you there , but you have power once you get there .
You know , rocket designers who use solar panels or fuel cells , I mean a few watts or kilowatts — wow , that &apos;s a lot of power .
I mean , now we &apos;re talking about 100 megawatts .
That &apos;s a ton of power .
That could power a Martian community .
That could power a rocket there .
And so I hope that maybe I &apos;ll have an opportunity to kind of explore my rocketry passion at the same time that I explore my nuclear passion .
And people say , &quot; &quot; Oh , well , you &apos;ve launched this thing , and it &apos;s radioactive , into space , and what about accidents ? &quot; &quot; But we launch plutonium batteries all the time .
Everybody was really excited about Curiosity , and that had this big plutonium battery on board that has plutonium-238 , which actually has a higher specific activity than the low-enriched uranium fuel of these molten salt reactors , which means that the effects would be negligible , because you launch it cold , and when it gets into space is where you actually activate this reactor .
So I &apos;m really excited .
I think that I &apos;ve designed this reactor here that can be an innovative source of energy , provide power for all kinds of neat scientific applications , and I &apos;m really prepared to do this .
I graduated high school in May , and — ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) — I graduated high school in May , and I decided that I was going to start up a company to commercialize these technologies that I &apos;ve developed , these revolutionary detectors for scanning cargo containers and these systems to produce medical isotopes , but I want to do this , and I &apos;ve slowly been building up a team of some of the most incredible people I &apos;ve ever had the chance to work with , and I &apos;m really prepared to make this a reality .
And I think , I think , that looking at the technology , this will be cheaper than or the same price as natural gas , and you don &apos;t have to refuel it for 30 years , which is an advantage for the developing world .
And I &apos;ll just say one more maybe philosophical thing to end with , which is weird for a scientist .
But I think there &apos;s something really poetic about using nuclear power to propel us to the stars , because the stars are giant fusion reactors .
They &apos;re giant nuclear cauldrons in the sky .
The energy that I &apos;m able to talk to you today , while it was converted to chemical energy in my food , originally came from a nuclear reaction , and so there &apos;s something poetic about , in my opinion , perfecting nuclear fission and using it as a future source of innovative energy .
So thank you guys .
( Applause )
And she called , and she said , &quot; I &apos;m really struggling with how to write about you on the little flyer . &quot;
And I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , what &apos;s the struggle ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; Well , I saw you speak , and I &apos;m going to call you a researcher , I think , but I &apos;m afraid if I call you a researcher , no one will come , because they &apos;ll think you &apos;re boring and irrelevant . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I was like , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; But the thing I liked about your talk is you &apos;re a storyteller .
And I thought , you know , I am a storyteller .
I &apos;m a qualitative researcher .
And maybe stories are just data with a soul .
And maybe I &apos;m just a storyteller .
And so I said , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
Why don &apos;t you just say I &apos;m a researcher-storyteller . &quot; &quot; And she went , &quot; &quot; Ha ha . There &apos;s no such thing . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So I &apos;m a researcher-storyteller , and I &apos;m going to talk to you today — we &apos;re talking about expanding perception — and so I want to talk to you and tell some stories about a piece of my research that fundamentally expanded my perception and really actually changed the way that I live and love and work and parent .
And this is where my story starts .
When I was a young researcher , doctoral student , my first year , I had a research professor who said to us , &quot; Here &apos;s the thing , if you cannot measure it , it does not exist . &quot;
And I thought he was just sweet-talking me .
I was like , &quot; &quot; Really ? &quot; &quot; and he was like , &quot; &quot; Absolutely . &quot; &quot; And so you have to understand that I have a bachelor &apos;s and a master &apos;s in social work , and I was getting my Ph.D. in social work , so my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind of believed in the &quot; &quot; life &apos;s messy , love it . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m more of the , &quot; &quot; life &apos;s messy , clean it up , organize it and put it into a bento box . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so to think that I had found my way , to found a career that takes me — really , one of the big sayings in social work is ,
&quot; Lean into the discomfort of the work . &quot;
And I &apos;m like , knock discomfort upside the head and move it over and get all A &apos;s .
That was my mantra .
So I was very excited about this .
And so I thought , you know what , this is the career for me , because I am interested in some messy topics .
But I want to be able to make them not messy .
I want to understand them .
I want to hack into these things that I know are important and lay the code out for everyone to see .
So where I started was with connection .
Because , by the time you &apos;re a social worker for 10 years , what you realize is that connection is why we &apos;re here .
It &apos;s what gives purpose and meaning to our lives .
This is what it &apos;s all about .
So I thought , you know what , I &apos;m going to start with connection .
Well , you know that situation where you get an evaluation from your boss , and she tells you 37 things that you do really awesome , and one &quot; &quot; opportunity for growth ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And all you can think about is that opportunity for growth , right ?
Well , apparently this is the way my work went as well , because , when you ask people about love , they tell you about heartbreak .
When you ask people about belonging , they &apos;ll tell you their most excruciating experiences of being excluded .
And when you ask people about connection , the stories they told me were about disconnection .
So very quickly — really about six weeks into this research — I ran into this unnamed thing that absolutely unraveled connection in a way that I didn &apos;t understand or had never seen .
And so I pulled back out of the research and thought , I need to figure out what this is .
And it turned out to be shame .
And shame is really easily understood as the fear of disconnection : Is there something about me that , if other people know it or see it , that I won &apos;t be worthy of connection ?
The things I can tell you about it : It &apos;s universal ; we all have it .
The only people who don &apos;t experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection .
No one wants to talk about it , and the less you talk about it , the more you have it .
This idea of , in order for connection to happen , we have to allow ourselves to be seen , really seen .
And you know how I feel about vulnerability . I hate vulnerability .
And so I thought , this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick .
I &apos;m going in , I &apos;m going to figure this stuff out , I &apos;m going to spend a year , I &apos;m going to totally deconstruct shame , I &apos;m going to understand how vulnerability works , and I &apos;m going to outsmart it .
So I was ready , and I was really excited .
As you know , it &apos;s not going to turn out well .
( Laughter ) You know this .
But here &apos;s what I can tell you that it boils down to — and this may be one of the most important things that I &apos;ve ever learned in the decade of doing this research .
My one year turned into six years : Thousands of stories , hundreds of long interviews , focus groups .
And I kind of got a handle on it .
I kind of understood , this is what shame is , this is how it works .
And that was , the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they &apos;re worthy of love and belonging .
That &apos;s it .
They believe they &apos;re worthy .
So what I did is I took all of the interviews where I saw worthiness , where I saw people living that way , and just looked at those .
What do these people have in common ?
I have a slight office supply addiction , but that &apos;s another talk .
So I had a manila folder , and I had a Sharpie , and I was like , what am I going to call this research ?
And the first words that came to my mind were &quot; &quot; whole-hearted . &quot; &quot; These are whole-hearted people , living from this deep sense of worthiness .
So I wrote at the top of the manila folder , and I started looking at the data .
In fact , I did it first in a four-day , very intensive data analysis , where I went back , pulled the interviews , the stories , pulled the incidents .
What &apos;s the theme ? What &apos;s the pattern ?
My husband left town with the kids because I always go into this Jackson Pollock crazy thing , where I &apos;m just writing and in my researcher mode .
And so here &apos;s what I found .
What they had in common was a sense of courage .
And I want to separate courage and bravery for you for a minute .
Courage , the original definition of courage , when it first came into the English language — it &apos;s from the Latin word &quot; &quot; cor , &quot; &quot; meaning &quot; &quot; heart &quot; &quot; — and the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart .
And so these folks had , very simply , the courage to be imperfect .
They had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others , because , as it turns out , we can &apos;t practice compassion with other people if we can &apos;t treat ourselves kindly .
And the last was they had connection , and — this was the hard part — as a result of authenticity , they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were , which you have to absolutely do that for connection .
The other thing that they had in common was this : They fully embraced vulnerability .
They believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful .
They didn &apos;t talk about vulnerability being comfortable , nor did they really talk about it being excruciating — as I had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing .
They just talked about it being necessary .
They talked about the willingness to say , &quot; &quot; I love you &quot; &quot; first ...
the willingness to do something where there are no guarantees ...
the willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram .
They &apos;re willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out .
They thought this was fundamental .
I personally thought it was betrayal .
I could not believe I had pledged allegiance to research , where our job — you know , the definition of research is to control and predict , to study phenomena for the explicit reason to control and predict .
And now my mission to control and predict had turned up the answer that the way to live is with vulnerability and to stop controlling and predicting .
And it did .
I call it a breakdown ; my therapist calls it a spiritual awakening .
( Laughter ) A spiritual awakening sounds better than breakdown , but I assure you , it was a breakdown .
And I had to put my data away and go find a therapist .
Let me tell you something : you know who you are when you call your friends and say , &quot; &quot; I think I need to see somebody .
Don &apos;t bring your measuring stick . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I was like , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; So I found a therapist .
My first meeting with her , Diana — I brought in my list of the way the whole-hearted live , and I sat down .
And she said , &quot; &quot; How are you ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m great . I &apos;m okay . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And this is a therapist who sees therapists , because we have to go to those , because their B.S. meters are good .
( Laughter ) And so I said , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s the thing , I &apos;m struggling . &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the struggle ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I have a vulnerability issue .
And I know that vulnerability is the core of shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness , but it appears that it &apos;s also the birthplace of joy , of creativity , of belonging , of love .
And I think I have a problem , and I need some help . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; But here &apos;s the thing : no family stuff , no childhood shit . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; I just need some strategies . &quot; ( Laughter )
( Applause ) Thank you .
So she goes like this .
( Laughter ) And then I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s bad , right ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s neither good nor bad . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; It just is what it is . &quot;
And I said , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , this is going to suck . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And it did , and it didn &apos;t .
And it took about a year .
And you know how there are people that , when they realize that vulnerability and tenderness are important , that they surrender and walk into it .
A : that &apos;s not me , and B : I don &apos;t even hang out with people like that .
( Laughter ) For me , it was a yearlong street fight .
Vulnerability pushed , I pushed back .
And so then I went back into the research and spent the next couple of years really trying to understand what they , the whole-hearted , what choices they were making , and what we are doing with vulnerability .
Why do we struggle with it so much ?
Am I alone in struggling with vulnerability ?
No .
So this is what I learned .
We numb vulnerability — when we &apos;re waiting for the call .
Having to ask my husband for help because I &apos;m sick , and we &apos;re newly married ; initiating sex with my husband ; initiating sex with my wife ; being turned down ; asking someone out ; waiting for the doctor to call back ; getting laid off ; laying off people .
This is the world we live in .
We live in a vulnerable world .
And one of the ways we deal with it is we numb vulnerability .
obese ...
addicted and medicated adult cohort in U.S. history .
The problem is — and I learned this from the research — that you cannot selectively numb emotion .
You can &apos;t say , here &apos;s the bad stuff .
Here &apos;s vulnerability , here &apos;s grief , here &apos;s shame , here &apos;s fear , here &apos;s disappointment .
I don &apos;t want to feel these .
I &apos;m going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin .
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t want to feel these .
And I know that &apos;s knowing laughter .
I hack into your lives for a living .
God .
( Laughter ) You can &apos;t numb those hard feelings without numbing the other affects , our emotions .
You cannot selectively numb .
So when we numb those , we numb joy , we numb gratitude , we numb happiness .
And then , we are miserable , and we are looking for purpose and meaning , and then we feel vulnerable , so then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin .
And it becomes this dangerous cycle .
One of the things that I think we need to think about is why and how we numb .
And it doesn &apos;t just have to be addiction .
The other thing we do is we make everything that &apos;s uncertain certain .
Religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty .
&quot; I &apos;m right , you &apos;re wrong . Shut up . &quot;
That &apos;s it .
Just certain .
The more afraid we are , the more vulnerable we are , the more afraid we are .
There &apos;s no discourse anymore .
There &apos;s no conversation .
There &apos;s just blame .
You know how blame is described in the research ?
A way to discharge pain and discomfort .
We perfect .
If there &apos;s anyone who wants their life to look like this , it would be me , but it doesn &apos;t work .
Because what we do is we take fat from our butts and put it in our cheeks .
( Laughter ) Which just , I hope in 100 years , people will look back and go , &quot; &quot; Wow . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And we perfect , most dangerously , our children .
Let me tell you what we think about children .
They &apos;re hardwired for struggle when they get here .
And when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand , our job is not to say , &quot; &quot; Look at her , she &apos;s perfect .
Our job is to look and say , &quot; &quot; You know what ? You &apos;re imperfect , and you &apos;re wired for struggle , but you are worthy of love and belonging . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s our job .
Show me a generation of kids raised like that , and we &apos;ll end the problems , I think , that we see today .
We pretend that what we do doesn &apos;t have an effect on people .
We do that in our personal lives .
We do that corporate — whether it &apos;s a bailout , an oil spill ...
a recall .
We pretend like what we &apos;re doing doesn &apos;t have a huge impact on other people .
I would say to companies , this is not our first rodeo , people .
We just need you to be authentic and real and say ...
&quot; We &apos;re sorry . We &apos;ll fix it . &quot;
But there &apos;s another way , and I &apos;ll leave you with this .
This is what I have found : To let ourselves be seen , deeply seen , vulnerably seen ...
Can I believe in this this passionately ?
Can I be this fierce about this ? &quot; &quot; just to be able to stop and , instead of catastrophizing what might happen , to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just so grateful , because to feel this vulnerable means I &apos;m alive . &quot; &quot; And the last , which I think is probably the most important , is to believe that we &apos;re enough .
Because when we work from a place , I believe , that says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m enough &quot; &quot; ...
That &apos;s all I have . Thank you .
After all , take a look at these events : Imperialism and colonization , world wars , George W. Bush .
Ask yourself , who &apos;s responsible ? Adults .
Now , what have kids done ?
Well , Anne Frank touched millions with her powerful account of the Holocaust .
Ruby Bridges helped to end segregation in the United States .
Now , if you don &apos;t trust someone , you place restrictions on them , right ?
Now , what &apos;s even worse than restriction , is that adults often underestimate kids &apos; abilities .
Thank you , Bill Gates , and thank you , Ma .
Instead of just scoffing at this heresy that a kid wanted to get published , or saying wait until you &apos;re older , my parents were really supportive .
One large children &apos;s publisher ironically said that they didn &apos;t work with children .
Kids grow up and become adults just like you .
It &apos;s the reason we &apos;re not in the Dark Ages anymore .
Now , the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas .
Kids need opportunities to lead and succeed .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you .
I also try to challenge myself to do things that doctors say are not possible .
That one was way more difficult than I had expected .
The one after that , I stood on top of a hundred-foot pillar for 36 hours .
In London I lived in a glass box for 44 days with nothing but water .
There was so many skeptics , especially the press in London , that they started flying cheeseburgers on helicopters around my box to tempt me .
As a young magician , I was obsessed with Houdini and his underwater challenges .
So , I began , early on , competing against the other kids , seeing how long I could stay underwater while they went up and down to breathe , you know , five times , while I stayed under on one breath .
By the time I was a teenager , I was able to hold my breath for three minutes and 30 seconds .
In 1987 I heard of a story about a boy that fell through ice and was trapped under a river .
When the rescue workers came , they resuscitated him and there was no brain damage .
His core temperature had dropped to 77 degrees .
And I was shivering .
But this is that attempt .
So , that clearly wasn &apos;t going to work .
( Laughter ) Then I actually started thinking about liquid breathing .
There is a chemical that &apos;s called perflubron .
And it &apos;s so high in oxygen levels that in theory you could breathe it .
So , I got my hands on that chemical , filled the sink up with it , and stuck my face in the sink and tried to breathe that in , which was really impossible .
It &apos;s basically like trying to breathe , as a doctor said , while having an elephant standing on your chest .
You know , because they go down for four minutes on one breath .
And when I was researching pearl divers , I found the world of free-diving .
There is depth records , where people go as deep as they can .
That was the one that I studied .
And then I learned how to purge .
Purging is basically hyperventilating .
At the end of that you &apos;re completely fried , your brain .
You feel like you &apos;re walking around in a daze .
Basically , I &apos;m not the best person to talk to when I &apos;m doing that stuff .
I started learning about the world-record holder .
And this guy is perfectly built for holding his breath .
He &apos;s six foot four . He &apos;s 160 pounds .
And his total lung capacity is twice the size of an average person .
I &apos;m six foot one , and fat .
( Laughter ) I had to drop 50 pounds in three months .
So , everything that I put into my body , I considered as medicine .
I ate really small controlled portions throughout the day .
And I started to really adapt my body .
( Laughter ) So , I had to add handcuffs , while holding my breath , to escape from .
And by seven minutes I had gone into these awful convulsions .
By 7 : 08 , I started to black out .
And by seven minutes and 30 seconds , they had to pull my body out and bring me back .
I had failed on every level .
I told her that I wanted to up the ante and hold my breath longer than any human being ever had .
This was a different record .
So , it &apos;s like base camp , Everest .
My first attempt on pure O2 , I was able to go up to 15 minutes .
So , he pulled me up , and I was fine .
And what he did in response , is he went on Regis and Kelly , and broke his old record .
Which was three minutes longer than I had prepared .
I wanted to get the Science Times to document this .
I wanted to get them to do a piece on it .
While he was there , I tried to impress him , of course .
I completely trained to get my breath-hold time up for what I needed to do .
But in practice , I would do it face down , floating on the pool .
So , I had to use my legs to hold my feet into the straps that were loose , which was a real problem for me .
Then , what they also did was , which we never did before , is there was a heart-rate monitor .
I kept pushing to 10 minutes .
At minute 12 I started to have ringing in my ears , and I started to feel my arm going numb .
And I &apos;m a hypochondriac , and I remember arm numb means heart attack .
It was awful .
And I started having ischemia to the heart .
It would skip a beat .
It would start . It would stop . And I felt all this .
And then suddenly I hear screaming .
And then I realized that I had made it to 16 : 32 .
So , with the energy of everybody that was there , I decided to keep pushing .
And I went to 17 minutes and four seconds .
I &apos;m here today to share with you an extraordinary journey - extraordinarily rewarding journey , actually - which brought me into training rats to save human lives by detecting landmines and tuberculosis .
As a child , I had two passions .
One was a passion for rodents .
I had all kinds of rats , mice , hamsters , gerbils , squirrels .
You name it , I bred it , and I sold them to pet shops .
( Laughter ) I also had a passion for Africa .
Growing up in a multicultural environment , we had African students in the house , and I learned about their stories , so different backgrounds , dependency on imported know-how , goods , services , exuberant cultural diversity .
Africa was truly fascinating for me .
I became an industrial engineer , engineer in product development , and I focused on appropriate detection technologies , actually the first appropriate technologies for developing countries .
I started working in the industry , but I wasn &apos;t really happy to contribute to a material consumer society in a linear , extracting and manufacturing mode .
I quit my job to focus on the real world problem : landmines .
We &apos;re talking &apos; 95 now .
Princess Diana is announcing on TV that landmines form a structural barrier to any development , which is really true .
As long as these devices are there , or there is suspicion of landmines , you can &apos;t really enter into the land .
Actually , there was an appeal worldwide for new detectors sustainable in the environments where they &apos;re needed to produce , which is mainly in the developing world .
We chose rats .
Why would you choose rats ?
Because , aren &apos;t they vermin ?
Well , actually rats are , in contrary to what most people think about them , rats are highly sociable creatures .
And actually , our product — what you see here .
There &apos;s a target somewhere here .
You see an operator , a trained African with his rats in front who actually are left and right .
There , the animal finds a mine .
It scratches on the soil .
And the animal comes back for a food reward .
Very , very simple .
Very sustainable in this environment .
Here , the animal gets its food reward .
And that &apos;s how it works .
Very , very simple .
Now why would you use rats ?
Rats have been used since the &apos; 50s last century , in all kinds of experiments .
Rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species .
They &apos;re extremely sensitive to smell .
Moreover , they have the mechanisms to map all these smells and to communicate about it .
Now how do we communicate with rats ?
Well don &apos;t talk rat , but we have a clicker , a standard method for animal training , which you see there .
A clicker , which makes a particular sound with which you can reinforce particular behaviors .
First of all , we associate the click sound with a food reward , which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe .
Once the animal knows click , food , click , food , click , food — so click is food — we bring it in a cage with a hole , and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed , and to do that for five seconds — five seconds , which is long for a rat .
Once the animal knows this , we make the task a bit more difficult .
It learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes , up to 10 holes .
Then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets .
In the next step , animals learn to find real mines in real minefields .
They are tested and accredited according to International Mine Action Standards , just like dogs have to pass a test .
This consists of 400 square meters .
There &apos;s a number of mines placed blindly , and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all the targets .
If the animal does that , it gets a license as an accredited animal to be operational in the field — just like dogs , by the way .
Maybe one slight difference : we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog .
This is our team in Mozambique : one Tanzanian trainer , who transfers the skills to these three Mozambican fellows .
And you should see the pride in the eyes of these people .
They have a skill , which makes them much less dependent on foreign aid .
Moreover , this small team together with , of course , you need the heavy vehicles and the manual de-miners to follow-up .
But with this small investment in a rat capacity , we have demonstrated in Mozambique that we can reduce the cost-price per square meter up to 60 percent of what is currently normal — two dollars per square meter , we do it at $ 1.18 , and we can still bring that price down .
Question of scale .
If you can bring in more rats , we can actually make the output even bigger .
We have a demonstration site in Mozambique .
Eleven African governments have seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology .
They have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the Great Lakes region , and they endorse hero rats to clear their common borders of landmines .
But let me bring you to a very different problem .
And there &apos;s about 6,000 people last year that walked on a landmine , but worldwide last year , almost 1.9 million died from tuberculosis as a first cause of infection .
Especially in Africa where T.B. and HIV are strongly linked , there is a huge common problem .
Microscopy , the standard WHO procedure , reaches from 40 to 60 percent reliability .
In Tanzania — the numbers don &apos;t lie — 45 percent of people — T.B. patients — get diagnosed with T.B. before they die .
It means that , if you have T.B. , you have more chance that you won &apos;t be detected , but will just die from T.B. secondary infections and so on .
And if , however , you are detected very early , diagnosed early , treatment can start , and even in HIV-positives , it makes sense .
You can actually cure T.B. , even in HIV-positives .
So in our common language , Dutch , the name for T.B.
is &quot; &quot; tering , &quot; &quot; which , etymologically , refers to the smell of tar .
Already the old Chinese and the Greek , Hippocrates , have actually published , documented , that T.B. can be diagnosed based on the volatiles exuding from patients .
So what we did is we collected some samples — just as a way of testing — from hospitals , trained rats on them and see if this works , and wonder , well , we can reach 89 percent sensitivity , 86 percent specificity using multiple rats in a row .
This is how it works , and really , this is a generic technology .
We &apos;re talking now explosives , tuberculosis , but can you imagine , you can actually put anything under there .
So how does it work ?
You have a cassette with 10 samples .
You put these 10 samples at once in the cage .
An animal only needs two hundredths of a second to discriminate the scent , so it goes extremely fast .
Here it &apos;s already at the third sample .
This is a positive sample .
It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward .
And by doing so , very fast , we can have like a second-line opinion to see which patients are positive , which are negative .
Just as an indication , whereas a microscopist can process 40 samples in a day , a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only .
A cage like this — ( Applause ) A cage like this — provided that you have rats , and we have now currently 25 tuberculosis rats — a cage like this , operating throughout the day , can process 1,680 samples .
Can you imagine the potential offspring applications — environmental detection of pollutants in soils , customs applications , detection of illicit goods in containers and so on .
But let &apos;s stick first to tuberculosis .
I just want to briefly highlight , the blue rods are the scores of microscopy only at the five clinics in Dar es Salaam on a population of 500,000 people , where 15,000 reported to get a test done .
Microscopy for 1,800 patients .
And by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and looping those results back , we were able to increase case detection rates by over 30 percent .
Throughout last year , we &apos;ve been — depending on which intervals you take — we &apos;ve been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in Dar es Salaam between 30 and 40 percent .
So this is really considerable .
Knowing that a missed patient by microscopy infects up to 15 people , healthy people , per year , you can be sure that we have saved lots of lives .
At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives .
The way forward for us is now to standardize this technology .
And there are simple things like , for instance , we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds .
So , to standardize this .
Also , to standardize the pellets , the food rewards , and to semi-automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people .
To conclude , there are also other applications at the horizon .
Here is a first prototype of our camera rat , which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on .
This is in a prototype stage .
We don &apos;t have a working system here yet .
To conclude , I would actually like to say , you may think this is about rats , these projects , but in the end it is about people .
It is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult , expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks , and doing that with a local resource , plenty available .
So something completely different is to keep on challenging your perception about the resources surrounding you , whether they are environmental , technological , animal , or human .
And to respectfully harmonize with them in order to foster a sustainable world .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
Isn &apos;t that cool ?
I want to start off by saying , Houston , we have a problem .
We &apos;re entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space . In fact , we &apos;ve regressed .
We stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth to go out and continue this very important thing that we as a species have always done .
And that is , instinctively we &apos;ve gone out and climbed over difficult places , went to more hostile places , and found out later , maybe to our surprise , that that &apos;s the reason we survived .
And I feel very strongly that it &apos;s not good enough for us to have generations of kids that think that it &apos;s OK to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it .
They need to look forward to exploration ; they need to look forward to colonization ; they need to look forward to breakthroughs .
We need to inspire them , because they need to lead us and help us survive in the future .
I &apos;m particularly troubled that what NASA &apos;s doing right now with this new Bush doctrine to — for this next decade and a half — oh shoot , I screwed up .
We have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics .
( Laughter ) What we &apos;re looking forward to is — ( Applause ) what we &apos;re looking forward to is not only the inspiration of our children , but the current plan right now is not really even allowing the most creative people in this country — the Boeing &apos;s and Lockheed &apos;s space engineers — to go out and take risks and try new stuff .
We &apos;re going to go back to the moon ... 50 years later ?
And we &apos;re going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new .
I &apos;m really troubled by that . But anyway that &apos;s — the basis of the thing that I want to share with you today , though , is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later .
That &apos;s the theme of my next 15 minutes here .
And I think that the inspiration begins when you &apos;re very young : three-year-olds , up to 12- , 14-year-olds .
What they look at is the most important thing .
Let &apos;s take a snapshot at aviation .
And there was a wonderful little short four-year time period when marvelous things happened .
It started in 1908 , when the Wright brothers flew in Paris , and everybody said , &quot; &quot; Ooh , hey , I can do that . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s only a few people that have flown in early 1908 . In four years , 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes , thousand of pilots . Airplanes were invented by natural selection .
Now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today , but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes .
There were probably at least 30,000 different things tried , and when they crash and kill the pilot , don &apos;t try that again .
The ones that flew and landed OK because there were no trained pilots who had good flying qualities by definition .
So we , by making a whole bunch of attempts , thousands of attempts , in that four-year time period , we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today . And that &apos;s why they &apos;re so safe , as we gave it a lot of chance to find what &apos;s good .
That has not happened at all in space flying .
There &apos;s only been two concepts tried — two by the U.S. and one by the Russians .
Well , who was inspired during that time period ?
Aviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought were the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation .
And I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation .
Well , what happened when I was a little kid was — some pretty heavy stuff too .
The jet age started : the missile age started . Von Braun was on there showing how to go to Mars — and this was before Sputnik .
And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now . We thought there &apos;d be animals there ; we knew there were plants there ; the colors change , right ?
But , you know , NASA screwed that up because they &apos;ve sent these robots and they &apos;ve landed it only in the deserts .
( Laughter ) If you look at what happened — this little black line is as fast as man ever flew , and the red line is top-of-the-line military fighters and the blue line is commercial air transport .
You notice here &apos;s a big jump when I was a little kid — and I think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something that other people weren &apos;t having the courage to try .
Well , what did I do when I was a kid ?
I didn &apos;t do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing and , well , we didn &apos;t have drugs in those days . But I did competition model airplanes .
I spent about seven years during the Vietnam War flight-testing airplanes for the Air Force .
And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garages .
And some 3,000 of those are flying . Of course , one of them is around the world Voyager . I founded another company in &apos; 82 , which is my company now .
And we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982 .
And there &apos;s a lot of them that I actually can &apos;t show you on this chart .
The most impressive airplane ever , I believe , was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet .
Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly , taken out of service .
We retreated in &apos; 98 back to something that was developed in &apos; 56 . What ?
The most impressive spaceship ever , I believe , was a Grumman Lunar Lander . It was a — you know , it landed on the moon , take off of the moon , didn &apos;t need any maintenance guys — that &apos;s kind of cool .
We &apos;ve lost that capability . We abandoned it in &apos; 72 .
This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in 1961 .
Three years , and we can &apos;t do that now . Crazy .
Talk very briefly about innovation cycles , things that grow , have a lot of activity ; they die out when they &apos;re replaced by something else .
These things tend to happen every 25 years .
40 years long , with an overlap . You can put that statement on all kinds of different technologies . The interesting thing — by the way , the speed here , excuse me , higher-speed travel is the title of these innovation cycles . There is none here .
These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC8 that was done in 1958 .
Here &apos;s the biggie , and that is , you don &apos;t have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it .
You know , a good example , of course , is the DARPA net .
Computers were used for artillery first , then IRS .
But when we got it , now you have all the level of activity , all the benefit from it . Private sector has to do it .
Keep that in mind . I put down innovation — I &apos;ve looked for innovation cycles in space ; I found none .
The very first year , starting when Gagarin went in space , and a few weeks later Alan Shepherd , there were five manned space flights in the world — the very first year .
In 2003 , everyone that the United States sent to space was killed .
There were only three or four flights in 2003 .
In 2004 , there were only two flights : two Russian Soyuz flights to the international manned station . And I had to fly three in Mojave with my little group of a couple dozen people in order to get to a total of five , which was the number the same year back in 1961 .
There is no growth . There &apos;s no activity . There &apos;s no nothing .
This is a picture here taken from SpaceShipOne .
This is a picture here taken from orbit .
Our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that .
We know how to do it for sub-orbital flying now , do it safe enough — at least as safe as the early airlines — so that can be done .
And I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small company .
Well , first of all , what &apos;s going to happen next ?
The first industry will be a high volume , a lot of players .
There &apos;s another one announced just last week .
And it will be sub-orbital . And the reason it has to be sub-orbital is , there is not solutions for adequate safety to fly the public to orbit . The governments have been doing this — three governments have been doing this for 45 years , and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died .
That &apos;s — You don &apos;t want to run a business with that kind of a safety record .
It &apos;ll be very high volume ; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020 .
I can &apos;t tell you when this will start , because I don &apos;t want my competition to know my schedule .
But I think once it does , we will find solutions , and very quickly , you &apos;ll see those resort hotels in orbit .
And that real easy thing to do , which is a swing around the moon so you have this cool view . And that will be really cool .
Because the moon doesn &apos;t have an atmosphere — you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by 10 feet if you want .
Oh , it &apos;s going to be so much fun .
( Laughter ) OK . My critics say , &quot; &quot; Hey , Rutan &apos;s just spending a lot of these billionaires &apos; money for joyrides for billionaires .
What &apos;s this ? This is not a transportation system ; it &apos;s just for fun . &quot; &quot; And I used to be bothered by that , and then I got to thinking , well , wait a minute . I bought my first Apple computer in 1978 and I bought it because I could say , &quot; &quot; I got a computer at my house and you don &apos;t .
&apos;What do you use it for ? &apos; Come over . It does Frogger . &quot; &quot; OK .
( Laughter ) Not the bank &apos;s computer or Lockheed &apos;s computer , but the home computer was for games .
For a whole decade it was for fun — we didn &apos;t even know what it was for .
But what happened , the fact that we had this big industry , big development , big improvement and capability and so on , and they get out there in enough homes — we were ripe for a new invention .
And the inventor is in this audience .
Al Gore invented the Internet and because of that , something that we used for a whole year — excuse me — a whole decade for fun , became everything — our commerce , our research , our communication and , if we let the Google guys think for another couple weekends , we can add a dozen more things to the list . ( Laughter ) And it won &apos;t be very long before you won &apos;t be able to convince kids that we didn &apos;t always have computers in our homes .
So fun is defendable .
OK , I want to show you kind of a busy chart , but in it is my prediction with what &apos;s going to happen .
And in it also brings up another point , right here .
There &apos;s a group of people that have come forward — and you don &apos;t know all of them — but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children , this little three- to 15-year-old age , by us going to orbit and going to the moon here , right in this time period .
Paul Allen , Elan Musk , Richard Branson , Jeff Bezos , the Ansari family , which is now funding the Russians &apos; sub-orbital thing , Bob Bigelow , a private space station , and Carmack .
These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area , and I think it &apos;s a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something — but they &apos;re putting it in very — areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability , and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore . And I think eventually it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct .
They were inspired by big progress . But look at the progress that &apos;s going on after that .
There were a couple of examples here .
The military fighters had a — highest-performance military airplane was the SR71 . It went a whole life cycle , got too rusty to fly , and was taken out of service . The Concorde doubled the speed for airline travel .
It went a whole life cycle without competition , took out of service . And we &apos;re stuck back here with the same kind of capability for military fighters and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late &apos; 50s .
But something is out there to inspire our kids now .
And I &apos;m talking about if you &apos;ve got a baby now , or if you &apos;ve got a 10-year-old now .
What &apos;s out there is there &apos;s something really interesting going to happen here .
Relatively soon , you &apos;ll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance military operational airplane . It &apos;s never happened before .
The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been , well , you know , you win the war in 12 minutes ; why do you need something better ?
But I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying sub-orbital flights to space , very soon — wait a minute , what &apos;s happening here , we &apos;ll have military fighters with sub-orbital capability , and I think very soon this .
But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first .
OK , I look forward to a new &quot; &quot; capitalist &apos;s space race , &quot; &quot; let &apos;s call it .
You remember the space race in the &apos; 60s was for national prestige , because we lost the first two milestones .
We didn &apos;t lose them technically . The fact that we had the hardware to put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it — you can argue that &apos;s not a technical loss .
Sputnik wasn &apos;t a technical loss , but it was a prestige loss .
America — the world saw America as not being the leader in technology , and that was a very strong thing .
And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin , not months or decades , or whatever . So we had the capability .
But America lost . We lost . And because of that , we made a big jump to recover it .
Well , again , what &apos;s interesting here is we &apos;ve lost to the Russians on the first couple of milestones already .
You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America — can &apos;t do it . You can buy it in Russia .
You can fly with Russian hardware . This is available because a Russian space program is starving , and it &apos;s nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats .
It &apos;s commercial . It can be defined as space tourism . They are also offering a trip to go on this whip around the moon , like Apollo 8 was done .
100 million bucks — hey , I can go to the moon .
But , you know , would you have thought back in the &apos; 60s , when the space race was going on , that the first commercial capitalist-like thing to do to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware ?
And would you have thought , would the Russians have thought , that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware , the guys inside won &apos;t be Russians ? Maybe it &apos;ll probably be a Japanese or an American billionaire ? Well , that &apos;s weird : you know , it really is .
But anyway , I think we need to beat them again .
I think what we &apos;ll do is we &apos;ll see a successful , very successful , private space flight industry . Whether we &apos;re first or not really doesn &apos;t matter .
The Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concorde .
And then they flew a few cargo flights , and took it out of service .
I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff is offered .
OK , we &apos;ll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight .
This little thing says here : five times what NASA &apos;s doing by 2020 . I want to tell you , already there &apos;s about 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion investment in private space flight that is not government at all — already , worldwide . If you read — if you Google it , you &apos;ll find about half of that money , but there &apos;s twice of that being committed out there — not spent yet , but being committed and planned for the next few years . Hey , that &apos;s pretty big .
I &apos;m predicting , though , as profitable as this industry is going to be — and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at 200,000 dollars on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost , or less — this is going to be very profitable .
I predict , also , that the investment that will flow into this will be somewhere around half of what the U.S. taxpayer spends for NASA &apos;s manned spacecraft work .
And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of 10 to 15 . And what that means is before we know it , the progress in human space flight , with no taxpayer dollars , will be at a level of about five times as much as the current NASA budgets for human space flight .
And that is because it &apos;s us . It &apos;s private industry .
You should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff — and we &apos;ve done it for a long time . The NACA , before NASA , never developed an airliner and never ran an airline .
But NASA is developing the space liner , always has , and runs the only space line , OK . And we &apos;ve shied away from it because we &apos;re afraid of it . But starting back in June of 2004 , when I showed that a little group out there actually can do it , can get a start with it , everything changed after that time .
OK , thank you very much .
( Applause )
In non-professional circles outside America , it &apos;s largely ignored .
If you want to know what I have to say about Darwinism itself , I &apos;m afraid you &apos;re going to have to look at my books , which you won &apos;t find in the bookstore outside .
Don &apos;t be fooled . There &apos;s nothing new about ID .
It &apos;s not a thing I often do , so listen carefully .
I think they &apos;re right that evolution is fundamentally hostile to religion .
The God theory is not just a bad theory .
It has certain ideas at the heart of it , which we call &apos; sacred &apos; or &apos; holy . &apos; What it means is : here is an idea or a notion that you &apos;re not allowed to say anything bad about .
Now , the next one .
Mr. Bush &apos;s reply has become infamous .
&quot; &quot; No , I don &apos;t know that atheists should be considered citizens , nor should they be considered patriots .
The latest survey makes surprisingly encouraging reading .
Why does this far more substantial minority not make a move to exercise its political muscle ?
About 20 percent are agnostic ; the rest could fairly be called atheists .
Among biological scientists , the figure is even lower : 5.5 percent , only , believe in God .
I &apos;ve not seen corresponding figures for elite scholars in other fields , such as history or philosophy , but I &apos;d be surprised if they were different .
From what I &apos;ve seen of TED , I think this may be the ideal place to launch it .
In most cases , people who out themselves will help to destroy the myth that there is something wrong with atheists .
There should be a snowball effect , a positive feedback , such that the more names we have , the more we get .
It &apos;s not recorded whether Aveling told Darwin to come down off his high horse .
The onus is not on the rest of us to say why not .
My problem with it is only its apparent anthropocentrism .

How many of you are creatives , designers , engineers , entrepreneurs , artists , or maybe you just have a really big imagination ?
Show of hands ? ( Cheers ) That &apos;s most of you .
I have some news for us creatives .
Over the course of the next 20 years , more will change around the way we do our work than has happened in the last 2,000 .
In fact , I think we &apos;re at the dawn of a new age in human history .
Now , there have been four major historical eras defined by the way we work .
The Hunter-Gatherer Age lasted several million years .
And then the Agricultural Age lasted several thousand years .
The Industrial Age lasted a couple of centuries .
And now the Information Age has lasted just a few decades .
And now today , we &apos;re on the cusp of our next great era as a species .
Welcome to the Augmented Age .
In this new era , your natural human capabilities are going to be augmented by computational systems that help you think , robotic systems that help you make , and a digital nervous system that connects you to the world far beyond your natural senses .
How many of you are augmented cyborgs ?
( Laughter ) I would actually argue that we &apos;re already augmented .
Imagine you &apos;re at a party , and somebody asks you a question that you don &apos;t know the answer to .
If you have one of these , in a few seconds , you can know the answer .
But this is just a primitive beginning .
Even Siri is just a passive tool .
In fact , for the last three-and-a-half million years , the tools that we &apos;ve had have been completely passive .
They do exactly what we tell them and nothing more .
Our very first tool only cut where we struck it .
The chisel only carves where the artist points it .
And even our most advanced tools do nothing without our explicit direction .
But I &apos;m more like Scotty in &quot; &quot; Star Trek . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I want to have a conversation with a computer .
I want to say , &quot; &quot; Computer , let &apos;s design a car , &quot; &quot; and the computer shows me a car .
( Laughter ) That conversation might be a little ways off , probably less than many of us think , but right now , we &apos;re working on it .
Tools are making this leap from being passive to being generative .
Generative design tools use a computer and algorithms to synthesize geometry to come up with new designs all by themselves .
All it needs are your goals and your constraints .
I &apos;ll give you an example .
Then what the computer does is it explores the entire solution space : every single possibility that solves and meets your criteria — millions of them .
It takes big computers to do this .
But it comes back to us with designs that we , by ourselves , never could &apos;ve imagined .
And by the way , it &apos;s no accident that the drone body looks just like the pelvis of a flying squirrel .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s because the algorithms are designed to work the same way evolution does .
We &apos;ve been working with Airbus for a couple of years on this concept plane for the future .
But just recently we used a generative-design AI to come up with this .
This is a 3D-printed cabin partition that &apos;s been designed by a computer .
It &apos;s stronger than the original yet half the weight , and it will be flying in the Airbus A320 later this year .
Unlike Maggie .
( Laughter ) Maggie &apos;s actually smarter than our most advanced design tools .
What do I mean by that ?
And how did she learn ?
And Maggie did three things : she had to pay attention , she had to remember what happened and she had to retain and create a pattern in her mind .
Back in 1952 , they built this computer that could play Tic-Tac-Toe .
Big deal .
Then 45 years later , in 1997 , Deep Blue beats Kasparov at chess .
2011 , Watson beats these two humans at Jeopardy , which is much harder for a computer to play than chess is .
In fact , rather than working from predefined recipes , Watson had to use reasoning to overcome his human opponents .
And then a couple of weeks ago , DeepMind &apos;s AlphaGo beats the world &apos;s best human at Go , which is the most difficult game that we have .
So in order to win , what AlphaGo had to do was develop intuition .
And in fact , at some points , AlphaGo &apos;s programmers didn &apos;t understand why AlphaGo was doing what it was doing .
And things are moving really fast .
I mean , consider — in the space of a human lifetime , computers have gone from a child &apos;s game to what &apos;s recognized as the pinnacle of strategic thought .
What &apos;s basically happening is computers are going from being like Spock to being a lot more like Kirk .
( Laughter ) Right ? From pure logic to intuition .
Would you cross this bridge ?
Most of you are saying , &quot; &quot; Oh , hell no ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And you arrived at that decision in a split second .
You just sort of knew that bridge was unsafe .
And that &apos;s exactly the kind of intuition that our deep-learning systems are starting to develop right now .
Or you could ask it if people are going to like your next song , or your next flavor of ice cream .
For instance , climate change .
So what about making all of this crazy new stuff that we &apos;re going to invent and design ?
I think the era of human augmentation is as much about the physical world as it is about the virtual , intellectual realm .
In the physical world , robotic systems .
OK , there &apos;s certainly a fear that robots are going to take jobs away from humans , and that is true in certain sectors .
But I &apos;m much more interested in this idea that humans and robots working together are going to augment each other , and start to inhabit a new space .
And this is Bishop , one of our robots .
We &apos;re using the human for what the human is good at : awareness , perception and decision making .
And we &apos;re using the robot for what it &apos;s good at : precision and repetitiveness .
The humans acted as labor .
They cruised around the construction site , they manipulated the bamboo — which , by the way , because it &apos;s a non-isomorphic material , is super hard for robots to deal with .
But then the robots did this fiber winding , which was almost impossible for a human to do .
And then we had an AI that was controlling everything .
It was telling the humans what to do , telling the robots what to do and keeping track of thousands of individual components .
What &apos;s interesting is , building this pavilion was simply not possible without human , robot and AI augmenting each other .
OK , I &apos;ll share one more project . This one &apos;s a little bit crazy .
So , Joris and an AI are designing this thing right now , as we speak , in Amsterdam .
And when they &apos;re done , we &apos;re going to hit &quot; &quot; Go , &quot; &quot; and robots will start 3D printing in stainless steel , and then they &apos;re going to keep printing , without human intervention , until the bridge is finished .
But what about our ability to sense and control these things ?
What about a nervous system for the things that we make ?
Our nervous system , the human nervous system , tells us everything that &apos;s going on around us .
But the nervous system of the things we make is rudimentary at best .
For instance , a car doesn &apos;t tell the city &apos;s public works department that it just hit a pothole at the corner of Broadway and Morrison .
A building doesn &apos;t tell its designers whether or not the people inside like being there , and the toy manufacturer doesn &apos;t know if a toy is actually being played with — how and where and whether or not it &apos;s any fun .
What if all of you had that kind of information flowing to you from the things you create in the real world ?
We &apos;re working on one project with a couple of guys down in Los Angeles called the Bandito Brothers and their team .
And one of the things these guys do is build insane cars that do absolutely insane things .
These guys are crazy — ( Laughter ) in the best way .
And what we &apos;re doing with them is taking a traditional race-car chassis and giving it a nervous system .
So we instrumented it with dozens of sensors , put a world-class driver behind the wheel , took it out to the desert and drove the hell out of it for a week .
And the car &apos;s nervous system captured everything that was happening to the car .
We captured four billion data points ; all of the forces that it was subjected to .
And then we did something crazy .
We took all of that data , and plugged it into a generative-design AI we call &quot; &quot; Dreamcatcher . &quot; &quot; So what do get when you give a design tool a nervous system , and you ask it to build you the ultimate car chassis ?
You get this .
This is something that a human could never have designed .
Except a human did design this , but it was a human that was augmented by a generative-design AI , a digital nervous system and robots that can actually fabricate something like this .
So if this is the future , the Augmented Age , and we &apos;re going to be augmented cognitively , physically and perceptually , what will that look like ?
What is this wonderland going to be like ?
Where we &apos;re moving from things that are constructed to that which is grown .
We &apos;re going to move from being isolated to being connected .
And we &apos;ll move away from extraction to embrace aggregation .
I also think we &apos;ll shift from craving obedience from our things to valuing autonomy .
Thanks to our augmented capabilities , our world is going to change dramatically .
The shape of things to come will be unlike anything we &apos;ve ever seen before .
Why ?
Because what will be shaping those things is this new partnership between technology , nature and humanity .
That , to me , is a future well worth looking forward to .
Thank you all so much .
( Applause )
Well , that &apos;s kind of an obvious statement up there .
I started with that sentence about 12 years ago , and I started in the context of developing countries , but you &apos;re sitting here from every corner of the world .
So if you think of a map of your country , I think you &apos;ll realize that for every country on Earth , you could draw little circles to say , &quot; These are places where good teachers won &apos;t go . &quot;
On top of that , those are the places from where trouble comes .
So we have an ironic problem — good teachers don &apos;t want to go to just those places where they &apos;re needed the most .
I started in 1999 to try and address this problem with an experiment , which was a very simple experiment in New Delhi .
I basically embedded a computer into a wall of a slum in New Delhi .
The children barely went to school , they didn &apos;t know any English — they &apos;d never seen a computer before , and they didn &apos;t know what the internet was .
I connected high speed internet to it — it &apos;s about three feet off the ground — turned it on and left it there .
After this , we noticed a couple of interesting things , which you &apos;ll see .
But I repeated this all over India and then through a large part of the world and noticed that children will learn to do what they want to learn to do .
This is the first experiment that we did — eight year-old boy on your right teaching his student , a six year-old girl , and he was teaching her how to browse .
This boy here in the middle of central India — this is in a Rajasthan village , where the children recorded their own music and then played it back to each other and in the process , they &apos;ve enjoyed themselves thoroughly .
They did all of this in four hours after seeing the computer for the first time .
In another South Indian village , these boys here had assembled a video camera and were trying to take the photograph of a bumble bee .
They downloaded it from Disney.com , or one of these websites , 14 days after putting the computer in their village .
So at the end of it , we concluded that groups of children can learn to use computers and the internet on their own , irrespective of who or where they were .
At that point , I became a little more ambitious and decided to see what else could children do with a computer .
We started off with an experiment in Hyderabad , India , where I gave a group of children — they spoke English with a very strong Telugu accent .
I gave them a computer with a speech-to-text interface , which you now get free with Windows , and asked them to speak into it .
So when they spoke into it , the computer typed out gibberish , so they said , &quot; &quot; Well , it doesn &apos;t understand anything of what we are saying . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , I &apos;ll leave it here for two months .
Make yourself understood to the computer . &quot; &quot; So the children said , &quot; &quot; How do we do that . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; I don &apos;t know , actually . &quot;
( Laughter ) And I left . ( Laughter )
Two months later — and this is now documented in the Information Technology for International Development journal — that accents had changed and were remarkably close to the neutral British accent in which I had trained the speech-to-text synthesizer .
In other words , they were all speaking like James Tooley .
( Laughter ) So they could do that on their own .
After that , I started to experiment with various other things that they might learn to do on their own .
I got an interesting phone call once from Columbo , from the late Arthur C. Clarke , who said , &quot; &quot; I want to see what &apos;s going on . &quot; &quot; And he couldn &apos;t travel , so I went over there .
He said two interesting things , &quot; A teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be . &quot;
( Laughter ) The second thing he said was that , &quot; &quot; If children have interest , then education happens . &quot; &quot; And I was doing that in the field , so every time I would watch it and think of him .
( Video ) Arthur C. Clarke : And they can definitely help people , because children quickly learn to navigate the web and find things which interest them .
And when you &apos;ve got interest , then you have education .
Sugata Mitra : I took the experiment to South Africa .
This is a 15 year-old boy .
( Video ) Boy : ... just mention , I play games like animals , and I listen to music .
SM : And I asked him , &quot; &quot; Do you send emails ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , and they hop across the ocean . &quot; &quot; This is in Cambodia , rural Cambodia — a fairly silly arithmetic game , which no child would play inside the classroom or at home .
They would , you know , throw it back at you .
They &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; This is very boring . &quot; &quot; If you leave it on the pavement and if all the adults go away , then they will show off with each other about what they can do .
This is what these children are doing .
They are trying to multiply , I think .
And all over India , at the end of about two years , children were beginning to Google their homework .
As a result , the teachers reported tremendous improvements in their English — ( Laughter ) rapid improvement and all sorts of things .
They said , &quot; &quot; They have become really deep thinkers and so on and so forth .
( Laughter ) And indeed they had .
I mean , if there &apos;s stuff on Google , why would you need to stuff it into your head ?
So at the end of the next four years , I decided that groups of children can navigate the internet to achieve educational objectives on their own .
At that time , a large amount of money had come into Newcastle University to improve schooling in India .
So Newcastle gave me a call . I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll do it from Delhi . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no way you &apos;re going to handle a million pounds-worth of University money sitting in Delhi . &quot; &quot; So in 2006 , I bought myself a heavy overcoat and moved to Newcastle .
I wanted to test the limits of the system .
The first experiment I did out of Newcastle was actually done in India .
And I set myself and impossible target : can Tamil speaking 12-year-old children in a South Indian village teach themselves biotechnology in English on their own ?
And I thought , I &apos;ll test them , they &apos;ll get a zero — I &apos;ll give the materials , I &apos;ll come back and test them — they get another zero , I &apos;ll go back and say , &quot; &quot; Yes , we need teachers for certain things . &quot; &quot; I called in 26 children .
They all came in there , and I told them that there &apos;s some really difficult stuff on this computer .
I wouldn &apos;t be surprised if you didn &apos;t understand anything .
It &apos;s all in English , and I &apos;m going .
( Laughter ) So I left them with it .
I came back after two months , and the 26 children marched in looking very , very quiet .
I said , &quot; &quot; Well , did you look at any of the stuff ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Yes , we did . &quot; &quot; &quot; Did you understand anything ? &quot; &quot; No , nothing . &quot;
So I said , &quot; &quot; Well , how long did you practice on it before you decided you understood nothing ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; We look at it every day . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; For two months , you were looking at stuff you didn &apos;t understand ? &quot; &quot; So a 12 year-old girl raises her hand and says , literally , &quot; &quot; Apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule causes genetic disease , we &apos;ve understood nothing else . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) It took me three years to publish that .
It &apos;s just been published in the British Journal of Educational Technology .
One of the referees who refereed the paper said , &quot; It &apos;s too good to be true , &quot; which was not very nice .
Well , one of the girls had taught herself to become the teacher .
And then that &apos;s her over there .
Remember , they don &apos;t study English .
I edited out the last bit when I asked , &quot; &quot; Where is the neuron ? &quot; &quot; and she says , &quot; &quot; The neuron ? The neuron , &quot; &quot; and then she looked and did this .
Whatever the expression , it was not very nice .
So their scores had gone up from zero to 30 percent , which is an educational impossibility under the circumstances .
But 30 percent is not a pass .
So I found that they had a friend , a local accountant , a young girl , and they played football with her .
I asked that girl , &quot; &quot; Would you teach them enough biotechnology to pass ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; How would I do that ? I don &apos;t know the subject . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , use the method of the grandmother . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s that ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what you &apos;ve got to do is stand behind them and admire them all the time .
Just say to them , &apos; That &apos;s cool . That &apos;s fantastic .
What is that ? Can you do that again ? Can you show me some more ? &apos; &quot; &quot; She did that for two months .
The scores went up to 50 , which is what the posh schools of New Delhi , with a trained biotechnology teacher were getting .
So I came back to Newcastle with these results and decided that there was something happening here that definitely was getting very serious .
So , having experimented in all sorts of remote places , I came to the most remote place that I could think of .
( Laughter ) Approximately 5,000 miles from Delhi is the little town of Gateshead .
In Gateshead , I took 32 children and I started to fine-tune the method .
I made them into groups of four .
I said , &quot; &quot; You make your own groups of four .
Each group of four can use one computer and not four computers . &quot; &quot; Remember , from the Hole in the Wall .
&quot; &quot; You can exchange groups .
You can walk across to another group , if you don &apos;t like your group , etc .
You can go to another group , peer over their shoulders , see what they &apos;re doing , come back to you own group and claim it as your own work . &quot; &quot; And I explained to them that , you know , a lot of scientific research is done using that method .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The children enthusiastically got after me and said , &quot; Now , what do you want us to do ? &quot;
I gave them six GCSE questions .
The first group — the best one — solved everything in 20 minutes .
The worst , in 45 .
They used everything that they knew — news groups , Google , Wikipedia , Ask Jeeves , etc .
The teachers said , &quot; &quot; Is this deep learning ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well , let &apos;s try it .
I &apos;ll come back after two months .
We &apos;ll give them a paper test — no computers , no talking to each other , etc . &quot; &quot; The average score when I &apos;d done it with the computers and the groups was 76 percent .
When I did the experiment , when I did the test , after two months , the score was 76 percent .
There was photographic recall inside the children , I suspect because they &apos;re discussing with each other .
A single child in front of a single computer will not do that .
I have further results , which are almost unbelievable , of scores which go up with time .
Because their teachers say that after the session is over , the children continue to Google further .
Here in Britain , I put out a call for British grandmothers , after my Kuppam experiment .
Well , you know , they &apos;re very vigorous people , British grandmothers .
200 of them volunteered immediately .
( Laughter ) The deal was that they would give me one hour of broadband time , sitting in their homes , one day in a week .
So they did that , and over the last two years , over 600 hours of instruction has happened over Skype , using what my students call the granny cloud .
The granny cloud sits over there .
I can beam them to whichever school I want to .
( Video ) Teacher : You can &apos;t catch me .
You say it .
You can &apos;t catch me .
Children : You can &apos;t catch me .
Teacher : I &apos;m the gingerbread man .
Children : I &apos;m the gingerbread man .
Teacher : Well done . Very good ...
SM : Back at Gateshead , a 10-year-old girl gets into the heart of Hinduism in 15 minutes .
You know , stuff which I don &apos;t know anything about .
Two children watch a TEDTalk .
They wanted to be footballers before .
After watching eight TEDTalks , he wants to become Leonardo da Vinci .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s pretty simple stuff .
This is what I &apos;m building now — they &apos;re called SOLEs : Self Organized Learning Environments .
The furniture is designed so that children can sit in front of big , powerful screens , big broadband connections , but in groups .
If they want , they can call the granny cloud .
This is a SOLE in Newcastle .
The mediator is from Pune , India .
So how far can we go ? One last little bit and I &apos;ll stop .
I went to Turin in May .
I sent all the teachers away from my group of 10 year-old students .
I speak only English , they speak only Italian , so we had no way to communicate .
I started writing English questions on the blackboard .
The children looked at it and said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well , do it . &quot; &quot; They typed it into Google , translated it into Italian , went back into Italian Google .
Fifteen minutes later — next question : where is Calcutta ?
This one , they took only 10 minutes .
I tried a really hard one then .
Who was Pythagoras , and what did he do ?
There was silence for a while , then they said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve spelled it wrong .
It &apos;s Pitagora . &quot; &quot; And then , in 20 minutes , the right-angled triangles began to appear on the screens .
This sent shivers up my spine .
These are 10 year-olds .
Text : In another 30 minutes they would reach the Theory of Relativity . And then ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) SM : So you know what &apos;s happened ?
I think we &apos;ve just stumbled across a self-organizing system .
A self-organizing system is one where a structure appears without explicit intervention from the outside .
Self-organizing systems also always show emergence , which is that the system starts to do things , which it was never designed for .
Which is why you react the way you do , because it looks impossible .
I think I can make a guess now — education is self-organizing system , where learning is an emergent phenomenon .
It &apos;ll take a few years to prove it , experimentally , but I &apos;m going to try .
But in the meanwhile , there is a method available .
One billion children , we need 100 million mediators — there are many more than that on the planet — 10 million SOLEs , 180 billion dollars and 10 years .
We could change everything .
Thanks .

How do we build a society without fossil fuels ?
This is a very complex challenge , and I believe developing countries could take the lead in this transition .
And I &apos;m aware that this is a contentious statement , but the reality is that so much is at stake in our countries if we let fossil fuels stay at the center of our development .
We can do it differently .
And it &apos;s time , it really is time , to debunk the myth that a country has to choose between development on the one hand and environmental protection , renewables , quality of life , on the other .
I come from Costa Rica , a developing country .
We are nearly five million people , and we live right in the middle of the Americas , so it &apos;s very easy to remember where we live .
Nearly 100 percent of our electricity comes from renewable sources , five of them .
( Applause ) Hydropower , geothermal , wind , solar , biomass .
Did you know that last year , for 299 days , we did not use any fossil fuels in order to generate all our electricity ?
Why ?
Because of our transportation system , which is totally dependent on fossil fuels , like it is in most countries .
So if we think of the energy transition as a marathon , the question is , how do we get to the finish line , how do we decarbonize the rest of the economy ?
And it &apos;s fair to say that if we don &apos;t succeed , it &apos;s difficult to see who will .
So that is why I want to talk to you about Costa Rica , because I believe we are a great candidate in pioneering a vision for development without fossil fuels .
If you know one thing about our country , it &apos;s that we don &apos;t have an army .
So I &apos;m going to take you back to 1948 .
That year , the country was coming out of civil war .
Thousands of Costa Ricans had died , and families were bitterly split .
And yet , a surprising idea won the hearts and minds : we would reboot the country , and that Second Republic would have no army .
So we abolished it .
And the president at the time , José Figueres , found a powerful way by smashing the walls of an army base .
The following year , 1949 , we made that decision permanent in the new constitution , and that is why I can tell you that story nearly 70 years later .
And I &apos;m grateful .
I &apos;m grateful they made that decision before I was born , because it allowed me and millions of others to live in a very stable country .
And you might be thinking that it was good luck , but it wasn &apos;t .
There was a pattern of deliberate choices .
In the &apos; 40s , Costa Ricans were given free education and free health care .
We called that social guarantees .
By abolishing the army , we were able to turn military spending into social spending , and that was a driver of stability .
In the &apos; 50s — ( Applause ) In the &apos; 50s , we started investing in hydropower , and that kept us away from the trap of using fossil fuels for electricity generation , which is what the world is struggling with today .
In the &apos; 70s we invested in national parks , and that kept us away from the deeply flawed logic of growth , growth , growth at any cost that you see others embracing , especially in the developing world .
So investing in environmental protection did not hurt our economy .
Quite the opposite .
That &apos;s not the point .
The point is that , by making our own choices , we were able to develop resilience in dealing with development problems .
Also , if you take a country like ours , the GDP per capita is around 11,000 dollars , depending on how you measure it .
Abolishing the army , investing in nature and people , did something very powerful , too .
It shaped the narrative , the narrative of a small country with big ideas , and it was very empowering to grow up with that narrative .
So the question is , what is the next big idea for this generation ?
And I believe what comes next is for this generation to let go of fossil fuels for good , just as we did with the army .
We know that , and we know how vulnerable we are to the impacts of climate change .
Because why would we continue importing oil for transportation if we can use electricity instead ?
Remember , this is the country where electricity comes from water in our rivers , heat from volcanoes , wind turbines , solar panels , biowaste .
Abolishing fossil fuels means disrupting our transportation system so that we can power our cars , buses and trains with electricity instead of dirty energy .
And transportation , let me tell you , has become an existential issue for us Costa Ricans , because the model we have is not working for us .
It &apos;s hurting people , it &apos;s hurting companies , and it &apos;s hurting our health .
Because when policies and infrastructure fail , this is what happens on a daily basis .
Two hours in the morning , two hours in the evening .
I don &apos;t understand why we have to accept this as normal .
It &apos;s offensive to have to waste our time like this every single day .
And this highway is actually quite good compared to what you see in other countries where traffic is exploding .
You know , Costa Ricans call this &quot; &quot; presa . &quot; &quot; Presa means &quot; &quot; imprisoned . &quot; &quot; And people are turning violent in a country that is otherwise happy in pura vida .
It &apos;s happening .
So a lot is at stake .
We &apos;re talking about electric mobility that is happening today .
By 2022 , electric cars and conventional cars are expected to cost the same , and cities are already trying electric buses .
And these really cool creatures are saving money , and they reduce pollution .
It &apos;s really exciting .
But of course , some get very uncomfortable with this idea , and they will come and they will tell you that the world is stuck with oil , and so is Costa Rica , so get real .
That &apos;s what they tell you .
And you know what the answer to that argument is ?
That in 1948 , we didn &apos;t say the world is stuck with armies , so let &apos;s keep our army , too .
No , we made a very brave choice , and that choice made the whole difference .
And I &apos;ll give you three reasons why we have to do this .
First , our model of transportation and urbanization is broken , so this is the best moment to redefine our urban and mobility future .
We don &apos;t want cities that are built for cars .
We want cities for people where we can walk and we can use bikes .
Because if we continue adding fleets of conventional cars , our cities will become unbearable .
Second , we have to change , but incremental change is not going to be sufficient .
We need transformational change .
And there are some incremental projects in my country , and I am the first one to celebrate them .
But let &apos;s not kid ourselves .
We &apos;re not talking about ending up with really beautiful electric cars here and a few electric buses there while we keep investing in the same kind of infrastructure , more cars , more roads , more oil .
We &apos;re talking about breaking free from oil , and you cannot get there through incrementalism .
Third , and you know this one , the world is hungry for inspiration .
So I believe Costa Rica can be an inspiration to others , as we did last year when we disclosed that for so many days we were not using any fossil fuels in order to generate all our electricity .
The news went viral around the world .
Also , and this makes me extremely proud , a Costa Rican woman , Christiana Figueres , played a decisive role in the negotiations of the Paris climate agreement .
So we have to protect that legacy and be an example .
So what comes next ?
The people .
How do we get people to own this ? How do we get people
to believe that it &apos;s possible to build a society without fossil fuels ?
A lot of work from the ground up is needed .
That is why , in 2014 , we created Costa Rica Limpia .
&quot; Limpia &quot; means &quot; clean , &quot; because we want to empower and we want to inspire citizens .
If citizens don &apos;t get engaged , clean transportation decisions will be bogged down by endless , and I mean endless , technical discussions , and by avalanches of lobbying by various established interests .
Wanting to be a green country powered by renewables is already part of our story .
We should not let anybody take that away from us .
Last year , we brought people from our seven provinces to talk about climate change in terms that matter to them , and we also brought this year another group of Costa Ricans to talk about renewable energy .
And you know what ?
So what we do is concrete things , and we translate technical issues into citizen language to show that citizens have a role to play and can play it together .
By the time the next election comes , I believe every candidate will have to disclose where they stand on the abolition of fossil fuels .
Because this question has to enter our mainstream politics .
And I &apos;m telling you , this is not a question of climate policy or environmental agenda .
It &apos;s about the country that we want and the cities that we have and the cities that we want and who makes that choice .
Because at the end of the day , what we have to show is that development with renewable energy is good for the people , for Costa Ricans that are alive today and especially for those who haven &apos;t been born .
This is our National Museum today .
It &apos;s bright and peaceful , and when you stand up in front of it , it &apos;s really hard to believe these were military barracks at the end of the &apos; 40s .
We started a new life without an army in this place , and here is where our abolition of fossil fuels will be announced one day .
And we will make history again .
Thank you .

When you &apos;re a child , anything and everything is possible .
The challenge , so often , is hanging on to that as we grow up .
And as a four-year-old , I had the opportunity to sail for the first time .
I will never forget the excitement as we closed the coast . I will never forget
the feeling of adventure as I climbed on board the boat and stared into her tiny cabin for the first time .
But the most amazing feeling was the feeling of freedom , the feeling that I felt when we hoisted her sails .
As a four-year-old child , it was the greatest sense of freedom that I could ever imagine .
I made my mind up there and then that one day , somehow , I was going to sail around the world .
So I did what I could in my life to get closer to that dream .
Age 10 , it was saving my school dinner money change .
Every single day for eight years , I had mashed potato and baked beans , which cost 4p each , and gravy was free .
Every day I would pile up the change on the top of my money box , and when that pile reached a pound , I would drop it in and cross off one of the 100 squares I &apos;d drawn on a piece of paper .
Finally , I bought a tiny dinghy .
I spent hours sitting on it in the garden dreaming of my goal .
I read every book I could on sailing , and then eventually , having been told by my school I wasn &apos;t clever enough to be a vet , left school age 17 to begin my apprenticeship in sailing .
So imagine how it felt just four years later to be sitting in a boardroom in front of someone who I knew could make that dream come true .
I felt like my life depended on that moment , and incredibly , he said yes .
And I could barely contain my excitement as I sat in that first design meeting designing a boat on which I was going to sail solo nonstop around the world .
From that first meeting to the finish line of the race , it was everything I &apos;d ever imagined .
Just like in my dreams , there were amazing parts and tough parts .
We missed an iceberg by 20 feet .
Nine times , I climbed to the top of her 90-foot mast .
We were blown on our side in the Southern Ocean .
But the sunsets , the wildlife , and the remoteness were absolutely breathtaking .
After three months at sea , age just 24 , I finished in second position .
I &apos;d loved it , so much so that within six months I decided to go around the world again , but this time not in a race : to try to be the fastest person ever to sail solo nonstop around the world .
Now for this , I needed a different craft : bigger , wider , faster , more powerful .
Just to give that boat some scale , I could climb inside her mast all the way to the top .
Seventy-five foot long , 60 foot wide .
I affectionately called her Moby .
She was a multihull .
The bar was now much , much higher .
And these boats were exciting to sail .
This was a training sail off the French coast .
This I know well because I was one of the five crew members on board .
Just see how far below those guys the sea is .
Imagine that alone in the Southern Ocean plunged into icy water , thousands of miles away from land .
It was Christmas Day .
I was forging into the Southern Ocean underneath Australia .
The conditions were horrendous .
I was approaching a part in the ocean which was 2,000 miles away from the nearest town .
The nearest land was Antarctica , and the nearest people would be those manning the European Space Station above me .
( Laughter ) You really are in the middle of nowhere .
If you need help , and you &apos;re still alive , it takes four days for a ship to get to you and then four days for that ship to get you back to port .
No helicopter can reach you out there , and no plane can land .
We are forging ahead of a huge storm .
Within it , there was 80 knots of wind , which was far too much wind for the boat and I to cope with .
The waves were already 40 to 50 feet high , and the spray from the breaking crests was blown horizontally like snow in a blizzard .
If we didn &apos;t sail fast enough , we &apos;d be engulfed by that storm , and either capsized or smashed to pieces .
We were quite literally hanging on for our lives and doing so on a knife edge .
The speed I so desperately needed brought with it danger .
We all know what it &apos;s like driving a car 20 miles an hour , 30 , 40 .
It &apos;s not too stressful . We can concentrate .
We can turn on the radio .
Take that 50 , 60 , 70 , accelerate through to 80 , 90 , 100 miles an hour .
Now you have white knuckles and you &apos;re gripping the steering wheel .
Now take that car off road at night and remove the windscreen wipers , the windscreen , the headlights and the brakes .
That &apos;s what it &apos;s like in the Southern Ocean .
But you &apos;re not a passenger .
You &apos;re alone on a boat you can barely stand up in , and you have to make every single decision on board .
I was absolutely exhausted , physically and mentally .
Eight sail changes in 12 hours .
The mainsail weighed three times my body weight , and after each change , I would collapse on the floor soaked with sweat with this freezing Southern Ocean air burning the back of my throat .
But out there , those lowest of the lows are so often contrasted with the highest of the highs .
A few days later , we came out of the back of the low .
Against all odds , we &apos;d been able to drive ahead of the record within that depression .
The sky cleared , the rain stopped , and our heartbeat , the monstrous seas around us were transformed into the most beautiful moonlit mountains .
It &apos;s hard to explain , but you enter a different mode when you head out there .
Your boat is your entire world , and what you take with you when you leave is all you have .
If I said to you all now , &quot; &quot; Go off into Vancouver and find everything you will need for your survival for the next three months , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s quite a task .
That &apos;s food , fuel , clothes , even toilet roll and toothpaste .
That &apos;s what we do , and when we leave we manage it down to the last drop of diesel and the last packet of food .
No experience in my life could have given me a better understanding of the definition of the word &quot; &quot; finite . &quot; &quot; What we have out there is all we have .
There is no more .
( Applause ) Suddenly I connected the dots .
Our global economy is no different .
It &apos;s entirely dependent on finite materials we only have once in the history of humanity .
And it was a bit like seeing something you weren &apos;t expecting under a stone and having two choices : I either put that stone to one side and learn more about it , or I put that stone back and I carry on with my dream job of sailing around the world .
I chose the first .
I put it to one side and I began a new journey of learning , speaking to chief executives , experts , scientists , economists to try to understand just how our global economy works .
And my curiosity took me to some extraordinary places .
This photo was taken in the burner of a coal-fired power station .
I was fascinated by coal , fundamental to our global energy needs , but also very close to my family .
My great-grandfather was a coal miner , and he spent 50 years of his life underground .
This is a photo of him , and when you see that photo , you see someone from another era .
He talked of the camaraderie underground , and the fact that the miners used to save the crusts of their sandwiches to give to the ponies they worked with underground .
It was like it was yesterday .
And on my journey of learning , I went to the World Coal Association website , and there in the middle of the homepage , it said , &quot; We have about 118 years of coal left . &quot;
And I thought to myself , well , that &apos;s well outside my lifetime , and a much greater figure than the predictions for oil .
But I did the math , and I realized that my great-grandfather had been born exactly 118 years before that year , and I sat on his knee until I was 11 years old , and I realized it &apos;s nothing in time , nor in history .
And it made me make a decision I never thought I would make : to leave the sport of solo sailing behind me and focus on the greatest challenge I &apos;d ever come across : the future of our global economy .
And I quickly realized it wasn &apos;t just about energy .
It was also materials .
In 2008 , I picked up a scientific study looking at how many years we have of valuable materials to extract from the ground : copper , 61 ; tin , zinc , 40 ; silver , 29 .
These figures couldn &apos;t be exact , but we knew those materials were finite .
We only have them once .
And yet , our speed that we &apos;ve used these materials has increased rapidly , exponentially .
With more people in the world with more stuff , we &apos;ve effectively seen 100 years of price declines in those basic commodities erased in just 10 years .
And this affects all of us .
And the more I learned , the more I started to change my own life .
It felt like actually doing less was what we had to do .
But it sat uneasy with me .
It didn &apos;t feel right .
It felt like we were buying ourselves time .
We were eking things out a bit longer .
Even if everybody changed , it wouldn &apos;t solve the problem .
It wouldn &apos;t fix the system .
It was vital in the transition , but what fascinated me was , in the transition to what ? What could actually work ?
It struck me that the system itself , the framework within which we live , is fundamentally flawed , and I realized ultimately that our operating system , the way our economy functions , the way our economy &apos;s been built , is a system in itself .
At sea , I had to understand complex systems .
I had to take multiple inputs , I had to process them , and I had to understand the system to win .
I had to make sense of it .
Life itself has existed for billions of years and has continually adapted to use materials effectively .
It &apos;s a complex system , but within it , there is no waste .
Everything is metabolized .
And I felt like the child in the garden .
For the first time on this new journey , I could see exactly where we were headed .
If we could build an economy that would use things rather than use them up , we could build a future that really could work in the long term .
I was excited .
This was something to work towards .
We knew exactly where we were headed . We just had to work out how to get there , and it was exactly with this in mind that we created the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in September 2010 .
Many schools of thought fed our thinking and pointed to this model : industrial symbiosis , performance economy , sharing economy , biomimicry , and of course , cradle-to-cradle design .
So what could this economy look like ?
Maybe we wouldn &apos;t buy light fittings , but we &apos;d pay for the service of light , and the manufacturers would recover the materials and change the light fittings when we had more efficient products .
What if packaging was so nontoxic it could dissolve in water and we could ultimately drink it ? It would never become waste .
What if engines were re-manufacturable , and we could recover the component materials and significantly reduce energy demand .
What if we could recover components from circuit boards , reutilize them , and then fundamentally recover the materials within them through a second stage ?
What if we could collect food waste , human waste ?
What if we could turn that into fertilizer , heat , energy , ultimately reconnecting nutrients systems and rebuilding natural capital ?
And cars — what we want is to move around .
We don &apos;t need to own the materials within them .
Could cars become a service and provide us with mobility in the future ?
All of this sounds amazing , but these aren &apos;t just ideas , they &apos;re real today , and these lie at the forefront of the circular economy .
What lies before us is to expand them and scale them up .
So how would you shift from linear to circular ?
Well , the team and I at the foundation thought you might want to work with the top universities in the world , with leading businesses within the world , with the biggest convening platforms in the world , and with governments .
We thought you might want to work with the best analysts and ask them the question , &quot; &quot; Can the circular economy decouple growth from resource constraints ?
Is the circular economy able to rebuild natural capital ?
Could the circular economy replace current chemical fertilizer use ? &quot; &quot; Yes was the answer to the decoupling , but also yes , we could replace current fertilizer use by a staggering 2.7 times .
But what inspired me most about the circular economy was its ability to inspire young people .
When young people see the economy through a circular lens , they see brand new opportunities on exactly the same horizon .
So could we achieve this in their lifetimes ?
Is it actually possible ?
I believe yes .
When you look at the lifetime of my great-grandfather , anything &apos;s possible .
When he was born , there were only 25 cars in the world ; they had only just been invented .
When he was 14 , we flew for the first time in history .
Now there are 100,000 charter flights every single day .
When he was 45 , we built the first computer .
Many said it wouldn &apos;t catch on , but it did , and just 20 years later we turned it into a microchip of which there will be thousands in this room here today .
Ten years before he died , we built the first mobile phone .
It wasn &apos;t that mobile , to be fair , but now it really is , and as my great-grandfather left this Earth , the Internet arrived .
Now we can do anything , but more importantly , now we have a plan .
Thank you .
( Applause )
What I &apos;d like you to do is , just really quickly , is just , sort of , nod to the person on your right , and then nod to the person on your left .
( Laughter ) Now , chances are that over the last winter , if you had been a beehive , either you or one of the two people you just nodded at would have died .
Now , that &apos;s an awful lot of bees .
And this is the second year in a row we have lost over 30 percent of the colonies , or we estimate we &apos;ve lost 30 percent of the colonies over the winter .
Now , that &apos;s a lot , a lot of bees , and that &apos;s really important .
And most of those losses are because of things we know .
We know that there are these varroa mites that have introduced and caused a lot of losses , and we also have this new phenomenon , which I talked about last year , Colony Collapse Disorder .
And here we see a picture on top of a hill in Central Valley last December .
And below , you can see all these out yards , or temporary yards , where the colonies are brought in until February , and then they &apos;re shipped out to the almonds .
And one documentary writer , who was here and looked at this two months after I was here , described this not as beehives but as a graveyard , with these empty white boxes with no bees left in them .
Now , I &apos;m going to sum up a year &apos;s worth of work in two sentences to say that we have been trying to figure out what the cause of this is .
And what we know is that it &apos;s as if the bees have caught a flu .
And this flu has wiped through the population of bees .
In some cases , and in fact in most cases in one year , this flu was caused by a new virus to us , or newly identified by us , called Israeli Acute Paralysis virus .
It was called that because a guy in Israel first found it , and he now regrets profoundly calling it that disease , because , of course , there &apos;s the implication .
But we think this virus is pretty ubiquitous .
It &apos;s also pretty clear that the bees sometimes catch other viruses or other flus , and so the question we &apos;re still struggling with , and the question that keeps us up at night , is why have the bees suddenly become so susceptible to this flu , and why are they so susceptible to these other diseases ?
And we don &apos;t have the answer to that yet , and we spend a lot of time trying to figure that out .
We think perhaps it &apos;s a combination of factors .
We know from the work of a very large and dynamic working team that , you know , we &apos;re finding a lot of different pesticides in the hive , and surprisingly , sometimes the healthiest hives have the most pesticides . And so we discover all these very strange things that we can &apos;t begin to understand .
And so this opens up the whole idea of looking at colony health .
Now of course , if you lose a lot of colonies , beekeepers can replace them very quickly .
And that &apos;s why we &apos;ve been able to recover from a lot of loss .
If we lost one in every three cows in the winter , you know , the National Guard would be out .
But what beekeepers can do is , if they have one surviving colony , they can split that colony in two .
And then the one half that doesn &apos;t have a queen , they can buy a queen .
It comes in the mail ; it can come from Australia or Hawaii or Florida , and you can introduce that queen .
And in fact , America was the first country that ever did mail-delivery queens and in fact , it &apos;s part of the postal code that you have to deliver queens by mail in order to make sure that we have enough bees in this country .
If you don &apos;t just want a queen , you can buy , actually , a three-pound package of bees , which comes in the mail , and of course , the Postal Office is always very concerned when they get , you know , your three-pound packages of bees .
And you can install this in your hive and replace that dead-out .
So it means that beekeepers are very good at replacing dead-outs , and so they &apos;ve been able to cover those losses .
So even though we &apos;ve lost 30 percent of the colonies every year , the same number of colonies have existed in the country , at about 2.4 million colonies .
Now , those losses are tragic on many fronts , and one of those fronts is for the beekeeper .
And it &apos;s really important to talk about beekeepers first , because beekeepers are among the most fascinating people you &apos;ll ever meet .
If this was a group of beekeepers , you would have everyone from the card-carrying NRA member who &apos;s , you know , live free or die , to the , you know , the self-expressed quirky San Francisco backyard pig farmer .
( Laughter ) And you get all of these people in the same room , and they &apos;re all engaged and they &apos;re getting along , and they &apos;re all there because of the passion for bees .
Now , there &apos;s another part of that community which are the commercial beekeepers , the ones who make their livelihood from beekeeping alone .
And these tend to be some of the most independent , tenacious , intuitive , you know , inventive people you will ever meet .
They &apos;re just fascinating . And they &apos;re like that all over the world .
I had the privilege of working in Haiti just for two weeks earlier this year .
And Haiti , if you &apos;ve ever been there , is just a tragedy .
I mean , there may be 100 explanations for why Haiti is the impoverished nation it is , but there is no excuse to see that sort of squalor .
But you meet this beekeeper , and I met this beekeeper here , and he is one of the most knowledgeable beekeepers I &apos;ve ever met .
No formal education , but very knowledgeable .
We needed beeswax for a project we were working on ; he was so capable , he was able to render the nicest block of beeswax I have ever seen from cow dung , tin cans and his veil , which he used as a screening , right in this meadow . And so that ingenuity is inspiring .
We also have Dave Hackenberg , who is the poster child of CCD .
He &apos;s the one who first identified this condition and raised the alarm bells .
And he has a history of these trucks , and he &apos;s moved these bees up and down the coast .
And a lot of people talk about trucks and moving bees , and that being bad , but we &apos;ve done that for thousands of years .
The ancient Egyptians used to move bees up and down the Nile on rafts , so this idea of a movable bee force is not new at all .
And one of our real worries with Colony Collapse Disorder is the fact that it costs so much money to replace those dead-out colonies .
And you can do that one year in a row , you may be able to do it two years in a row .
But if you &apos;re losing 50 percent to 80 percent of your colonies , you can &apos;t survive three years in a row . And we &apos;re really worried about losing this segment of our industry .
And that &apos;s important for many fronts , and one of them is because of that culture that &apos;s in agriculture .
And these migratory beekeepers are the last nomads of America .
You know , they pick up their hives ; they move their families once or twice in a year .
And if you look at Florida , in Dade City , Florida , that &apos;s where all the Pennsylvania beekeepers go .
And then 20 miles down the road is Groveland , and that &apos;s where all the Wisconsin beekeepers go .
And if you &apos;re ever in Central Valley in February , you go to this café at 10 o &apos;clock in the morning , Kathy and Kate &apos;s .
And that &apos;s where all the beekeepers come after a night of moving bees into the almond groves .
They all have their breakfast and complain about everyone right there . And it &apos;s a great experience , and I really encourage you to drop in at that diner during that time , because that &apos;s quite essential American experience .
And we see these families , these nomadic families , you know , father to son , father to son , and these guys are hurting .
And they &apos;re not people who like to ask for help , although they are the most helpful people ever .
If there &apos;s one guy who loses all his bees because of a truck overhaul , everyone pitches in and gives 20 hives to help him replace those lost colonies .
And so , it &apos;s a very dynamic , and I think , historic and exciting community to be involved with .
Of course , the real importance for bees is not the honey .
And although I highly encourage you , all use honey .
I mean , it &apos;s the most ethical sweetener , and you know , it &apos;s a dynamic and fun sweetener .
But we estimate that about one in three bites of food we eat is directly or indirectly pollinated by honeybees .
Now , I want to just illustrate that in the fact that if we look at the breakfast I had yesterday morning — a little cranberry juice , some fruits , some granola , I should have had whole wheat bread , I realized , but you know , jam on my Wonderbread , and some coffee — and had we taken out all those ingredients , — except for the almonds I wasn &apos;t going to pick out from the granola — if we had taken out all those ingredients the bees had indirectly or directly pollinated , we wouldn &apos;t have much on our plate .
So if we did not have bees , it &apos;s not like we would starve , but clearly our diet would be diminished .
It &apos;s said that for bees , the flower is the fountain of life , and for flowers bees are the messengers of love .
And that &apos;s a really great expression , because really , bees are the sex workers for flowers . They are , you know — they get paid for their services .
They get paid by pollen and nectar , to move that male sperm , the pollen , from flower to flower .
And there are flowers that are self-infertile . That means they can &apos;t — the pollen in their bloom can &apos;t fertilize themselves .
So in an apple orchard , for instance , you &apos;ll have rows of 10 apples of one variety , and then you have another apple tree that &apos;s a different type of pollen .
And bees are very faithful .
When they &apos;re out pollinating or gathering pollen from one flower , they stay to that crop exclusively , in order to help generate .
And of course , they &apos;re made to carry this pollen .
They build up a static electric charge and the pollen jumps on them and helps spread that pollen from bloom to bloom .
However , honeybees are a minority .
Honeybees are not native to America ; they were introduced with the colonialists .
And there are actually more species of bees than there are mammals and birds combined .
In Pennsylvania alone , we have been surveying bees for 150 years , and very intensely in the last three years .
We have identified over 400 species of bees in Pennsylvania .
Thirty-two species have not been identified or found in the state since 1950 .
Now , that could be because we haven &apos;t been sampling right , but it does , I think , suggest that something &apos;s wrong with the pollinator force . And these bees are fascinating .
We have bumblebees on the top .
And bumblebees are what we call eusocial : they &apos;re not truly social , because only the queen is , over winter .
We also have the sweat bees , and these are little gems flying around .
They &apos;re like tiny little flies and they fly around .
And then you have another type of bee , which we call kleptoparasites , which is a very fancy way of saying , bad-minded , murdering — what &apos;s the word I &apos;m looking for ? Murdering — Audience : Bee ?
Dennis vanEngelsdorp : Bee . Okay , thanks .
( Laughter ) What these bees do is , they sit there . These solitary bees , they drill a hole in the ground or drill a hole in a branch , and they collect pollen and make it into a ball , and they lay an egg on it .
Well , these bees hang out at that hole , and they wait for that mother to fly away , they go in , eat the egg , and lay their own egg there . So they don &apos;t do any work .
And so , in fact , if you know you have these kleptoparasitic bees , you know that your environment is healthy , because they &apos;re top-of-the-food-chain bees .
And in fact , there is now a red list of pollinators that we &apos;re worried have disappeared , and on top of that list are a lot of these kleptoparasites , but also these bumblebees .
And in fact , if you guys live on the West Coast , go to these websites here , and they &apos;re really looking for people to look for some of these bumblebees , because we think some have gone extinct . Or some , the population has declined .
And so it &apos;s not just honeybees that are in trouble , but we don &apos;t understand these native pollinators or all those other parts of our community .
And of course , bees are not the only important factor here .
There are other animals that pollinate , like bats , and bats are in trouble too .
And I &apos;m glad I &apos;m a bee man and not a bat man , because there &apos;s no money to research the bat problems .
And bats are dying at an extraordinary rate .
White-nose syndrome has wiped out populations of bats .
If there &apos;s a cave in New York that had 15,000 bats in it , and there are 1,000 left . That &apos;s like San Francisco becoming the population of half of this county in three years .
And so that &apos;s incredible . And there &apos;s no money to do that .
But I &apos;m glad to say that I think we know the cause of all these conditions , and that cause is NDD : Nature Deficit Disorder .
And that is that I think that what we have in our society is , we forgot our connection with nature .
And I think if we reconnect to nature , we &apos;ll be able to have the resources and that interest to solve these problems .
And I think that there is an easy cure for NDD .
And that is , make meadows and not lawns .
And I think we have lost our connection , and this is a wonderful way of reconnecting to our environment .
I &apos;ve had the privilege of living by a meadow for the last little while , and it is terribly engaging .
And if we look at the history of lawns , it &apos;s actually rather tragic .
It used to be , two , three hundred years ago , that a lawn was a symbol of prestige , and so it was only the very rich that could keep these green actually , deserts : they &apos;re totally sterile .
Americans spent , in 2001 — 11 percent of all pesticide use was done on lawns .
Five percent of our greenhouse gases are produced by mowing our lawns .
And so it &apos;s incredible the amount of resources we &apos;ve spent keeping our lawns , which are these useless biosystems .
And so we need to rethink this idea .
In fact , you know , the White House used to have sheep in front in order to help fund the war effort in World War I , which probably is not a bad idea ; it wouldn &apos;t be a bad idea .
I want to say this not because I &apos;m opposed completely to mowing lawns .
I think that there is perhaps some advantage to keeping lawns at a limited scale , and I think we &apos;re encouraged to do that .
But I also want to reinforce some of the ideas we &apos;ve heard here , because having a meadow or living by a meadow is transformational .
That it is amazing that connection we can have with what &apos;s there .
These milkweed plants have grown up in my meadow over the last four years . Add to watch the different plants , or insects , that come to these flowers , to watch that — and we &apos;ve heard about , you know , this relationship you can have with wine , this companion you can have as it matures and as it has these different fragrances .
And this is a companion , and this is a relationship that never dries up .
You never run out of that companion as you drink this wine , too .
And I encourage you to look at that .
Now , not all of us have meadows , or lawns that we can convert , and so you can always , of course , grow a meadow in a pot .
Bees apparently , can be the gateway to , you know , other things .
So I &apos;m not saying that you should plant a meadow of pot , but a pot in a meadow .
But you can also have this great community of city or building-top beekeepers , these beekeepers that live — This is in Paris where these beekeepers live .
And everyone should open a beehive , because it is the most amazing , incredible thing .
And if we want to cure ourselves of NDD , or Nature Deficit Disorder , I think this is a great way of doing it .
Get a beehive and grow a meadow , and watch that life come back into your life .
And so with that , I think that what we can do , if we do this , we can make sure that our future — our more perfect future — includes beekeepers and it includes bees and it includes those meadows .
And that journey — that journey of transformation that occurs as you grow your meadow and as you keep your bees or you watch those native bees there — is an extremely exciting one .
And I hope that you experience it and I hope you tell me about it one day .
So thank you very much for being here . Thank you very much .
I &apos;m a savant , or more precisely , a high-functioning autistic savant .
It &apos;s a rare condition .
And rarer still when accompanied , as in my case , by self-awareness and a mastery of language .
Very often when I meet someone and they learn this about me , there &apos;s a certain kind of awkwardness .
I can see it in their eyes .
They want to ask me something .
And in the end , quite often , the urge is stronger than they are and they blurt it out : &quot; &quot; If I give you my date of birth , can you tell me what day of the week I was born on ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Or they mention cube roots or ask me to recite a long number or long text .
I hope you &apos;ll forgive me if I don &apos;t perform a kind of one-man savant show for you today .
I &apos;m going to talk instead about something far more interesting than dates of birth or cube roots — a little deeper and a lot closer , to my mind , than work .
I want to talk to you briefly about perception .
When he was writing the plays and the short stories that would make his name , Anton Chekhov kept a notebook in which he noted down his observations of the world around him — little details that other people seem to miss .
Every time I read Chekhov and his unique vision of human life , I &apos;m reminded of why I too became a writer .
In my books , I explore the nature of perception and how different kinds of perceiving create different kinds of knowing and understanding .
Here are three questions drawn from my work .
Rather than try to figure them out , I &apos;m going to ask you to consider for a moment the intuitions and the gut instincts that are going through your head and your heart as you look at them .
For example , the calculation : can you feel where on the number line the solution is likely to fall ?
Or look at the foreign word and the sounds : can you get a sense of the range of meanings that it &apos;s pointing you towards ?
And in terms of the line of poetry , why does the poet use the word hare rather than rabbit ?
I &apos;m asking you to do this because I believe our personal perceptions , you see , are at the heart of how we acquire knowledge .
Aesthetic judgments , rather than abstract reasoning , guide and shape the process by which we all come to know what we know .
I &apos;m an extreme example of this .
My worlds of words and numbers blur with color , emotion and personality .
As Juan said , it &apos;s the condition that scientists call synesthesia , an unusual cross-talk between the senses .
Here are the numbers one to 12 as I see them — every number with its own shape and character .
One is a flash of white light .
Six is a tiny and very sad black hole .
The sketches are in black and white here , but in my mind they have colors .
Three is green .
Four is blue .
Five is yellow .
I paint as well .
And here is one of my paintings .
It &apos;s a multiplication of two prime numbers .
Three-dimensional shapes and the space they create in the middle creates a new shape , the answer to the sum .
What about bigger numbers ?
Well you can &apos;t get much bigger than Pi , the mathematical constant .
It &apos;s an infinite number — literally goes on forever .
In this painting that I made of the first 20 decimals of Pi , I take the colors and the emotions and the textures and I pull them all together into a kind of rolling numerical landscape .
But it &apos;s not only numbers that I see in colors .
Words too , for me , have colors and emotions and textures .
And this is an opening phrase from the novel &quot; &quot; Lolita . &quot; &quot; And Nabokov was himself synesthetic .
And you can see here how my perception of the sound L helps the alliteration to jump right out .
Another example : a little bit more mathematical .
And I wonder if some of you will notice the construction of the sentence from &quot; &quot; The Great Gatsby . &quot; &quot; There is a procession of syllables — wheat , one ; prairies , two ; lost Swede towns , three — one , two , three .
And this effect is very pleasant on the mind , and it helps the sentence to feel right .
Let &apos;s go back to the questions I posed you a moment ago .
64 multiplied by 75 .
If some of you play chess , you &apos;ll know that 64 is a square number , and that &apos;s why chessboards , eight by eight , have 64 squares .
So that gives us a form that we can picture , that we can perceive .
What about 75 ?
Well if 100 , if we think of 100 as being like a square , 75 would look like this .
So what we need to do now is put those two pictures together in our mind — something like this .
64 becomes 6,400 .
And in the right-hand corner , you don &apos;t have to calculate anything .
Four across , four up and down — it &apos;s 16 .
So what the sum is actually asking you to do is 16 , 16 , 16 .
That &apos;s a lot easier than the way that the school taught you to do math , I &apos;m sure .
It &apos;s 16 , 16 , 16 , 48 , 4,800 — 4,800 , the answer to the sum .
Easy when you know how .
( Laughter ) The second question was an Icelandic word .
I &apos;m assuming there are not many people here who speak Icelandic .
So let me narrow the choices down to two .
Hnugginn : is it a happy word , or a sad word ?
What do you say ?
Okay .
Some people say it &apos;s happy .
Most people , a majority of people , say sad .
And it actually means sad .
( Laughter ) Why do , statistically , a majority of people say that a word is sad , in this case , heavy in other cases ?
In my theory , language evolves in such a way that sounds match , correspond with , the subjective , with the personal , intuitive experience of the listener .
Let &apos;s have a look at the third question .
It &apos;s a line from a poem by John Keats .
Words , like numbers , express fundamental relationships between objects and events and forces that constitute our world .
It stands to reason that we , existing in this world , should in the course of our lives absorb intuitively those relationships .
And poets , like other artists , play with those intuitive understandings .
In the case of hare , it &apos;s an ambiguous sound in English .
It can also mean the fibers that grow from a head .
And if we think of that — let me put the picture up — the fibers represent vulnerability .
They yield to the slightest movement or motion or emotion .
So what you have is an atmosphere of vulnerability and tension .
The hare itself , the animal — not a cat , not a dog , a hare — why a hare ?
Because think of the picture — not the word , the picture .
The overlong ears , the overlarge feet , helps us to picture , to feel intuitively , what it means to limp and to tremble .
So in these few minutes , I hope I &apos;ve been able to share a little bit of my vision of things and to show you that words can have colors and emotions , numbers , shapes and personalities .
The world is richer , vaster than it too often seems to be .
I hope that I &apos;ve given you the desire to learn to see the world with new eyes .
Thank you .

This is a guy named Bob McKim .
He was a creativity researcher in the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , and also led the Stanford Design Program .
And in fact , my friend and IDEO founder , David Kelley , who ’ s out there somewhere , studied under him at Stanford .
And he liked to do an exercise with his students where he got them to take a piece of paper and draw the person who sat next to them , their neighbor , very quickly , just as quickly as they could .
And in fact , we ’ re going to do that exercise right now .
You all have a piece of cardboard and a piece of paper .
It ’ s actually got a bunch of circles on it .
I need you to turn that piece of paper over ; you should find that it ’ s blank on the other side .
And there should be a pencil .
And I want you to pick somebody that ’ s seated next to you , and when I say , go , you ’ ve got 30 seconds to draw your neighbor , OK ?
So , everybody ready ? OK . Off you go .
You ’ ve got 30 seconds , you ’ d better be fast .
Come on : those masterpieces ...
OK ? Stop . All right , now .
( Laughter ) Yes , lot ’ s of laughter . Yeah , exactly .
Lots of laughter , quite a bit of embarrassment .
( Laughter ) Am I hearing a few &quot; &quot; sorry ’ s &quot; &quot; ? I think I ’ m hearing a few sorry ’ s .
Yup , yup , I think I probably am .
And that ’ s exactly what happens every time , every time you do this with adults .
McKim found this every time he did it with his students .
He got exactly the same response : lots and lots of sorry ’ s .
( Laughter ) And he would point this out as evidence that we fear the judgment of our peers , and that we ’ re embarrassed about showing our ideas to people we think of as our peers , to those around us .
And this fear is what causes us to be conservative in our thinking .
So we might have a wild idea , but we ’ re afraid to share it with anybody else .
OK , so if you try the same exercise with kids , they have no embarrassment at all .
They just quite happily show their masterpiece to whoever wants to look at it .
But as they learn to become adults , they become much more sensitive to the opinions of others , and they lose that freedom and they do start to become embarrassed .
And in studies of kids playing , it ’ s been shown time after time that kids who feel secure , who are in a kind of trusted environment — they ’ re the ones that feel most free to play .
And if you ’ re starting a design firm , let ’ s say , then you probably also want to create a place where people have the same kind of security .
Where they have the same kind of security to take risks .
Maybe have the same kind of security to play .
Before founding IDEO , David said that what he wanted to do was to form a company where all the employees are my best friends .
Now , that wasn ’ t just self-indulgence .
He knew that friendship is a short cut to play .
And he knew that it gives us a sense of trust , and it allows us then to take the kind of creative risks that we need to take as designers .
And so , that decision to work with his friends — now he has 550 of them — was what got IDEO started .
And our studios , like , I think , many creative workplaces today , are designed to help people feel relaxed : familiar with their surroundings , comfortable with the people that they ’ re working with .
It takes more than decor , but I think we ’ ve all seen that creative companies do often have symbols in the workplace that remind people to be playful , and that it ’ s a permissive environment .
So , whether it ’ s this microbus meeting room that we have in one our buildings at IDEO ; or at Pixar , where the animators work in wooden huts and decorated caves ; or at the Googleplex , where it ’ s famous for its &#91; beach &#93; volleyball courts , and even this massive dinosaur skeleton with pink flamingos on it .
Don ’ t know the reason for the pink flamingos , but anyway , they ’ re there in the garden .
Or even in the Swiss office of Google , which perhaps has the most wacky ideas of all .
And my theory is , that ’ s so the Swiss can prove to their Californian colleagues that they ’ re not boring .
So they have the slide , and they even have a fireman ’ s pole .
Don ’ t know what they do with that , but they have one .
So all of these places have these symbols .
Now , our big symbol at IDEO is actually not so much the place , it ’ s a thing .
And it ’ s actually something that we invented a few years ago , or created a few years ago .
It ’ s a toy ; it ’ s called a &quot; &quot; finger blaster . &quot; &quot; And I forgot to bring one up with me .
So if somebody can reach under the chair that ’ s next to them , you ’ ll find something taped underneath it .
That ’ s great . If you could pass it up . Thanks , David , I appreciate it .
So this is a finger blaster , and you will find that every one of you has got one taped under your chair .
And I ’ m going to run a little experiment . Another little experiment .
But before we start , I need just to put these on .
Thank you . All right .
Now , what I ’ m going to do is , I ’ m going to see how — I can ’ t see out of these , OK .
I ’ m going to see how many of you at the back of the room can actually get those things onto the stage .
So the way they work is , you know , you just put your finger in the thing , pull them back , and off you go .
So , don ’ t look backwards . That ’ s my only recommendation here .
I want to see how many of you can get these things on the stage .
So come on ! There we go , there we go . Thank you . Thank you . Oh .
I have another idea . I wanted to — there we go .
( Laughter ) There we go . ( Laughter )
Thank you , thank you , thank you .
Not bad , not bad . No serious injuries so far .
( Laughter ) Well , they ’ re still coming in from the back there ; they ’ re still coming in .
Some of you haven ’ t fired them yet .
Can you not figure out how to do it , or something ?
It ’ s not that hard . Most of your kids figure out how to do this in the first 10 seconds , when they pick it up .
All right . This is pretty good ; this is pretty good .
Okay , all right . Let ’ s — I suppose we &apos;d better ...
I &apos;d better clear these up out of the way ; otherwise , I ’ m going to trip over them .
All right . So the rest of you can save them for when I say something particularly boring , and then you can fire at me .
( Laughter ) All right . I think I ’ m going to take these off now , because I can ’ t see a damn thing when I ’ ve — all right , OK .
So , ah , that was fun .
( Laughter ) All right , good .
( Applause ) So , OK , so why ?
So we have the finger blasters . Other people have dinosaurs , you know .
Why do we have them ? Well , as I said , we have them because we think maybe playfulness is important .
But why is it important ?
We use it in a pretty pragmatic way , to be honest .
We think playfulness helps us get to better creative solutions .
Helps us do our jobs better , and helps us feel better when we do them .
Now , an adult encountering a new situation — when we encounter a new situation we have a tendency to want to categorize it just as quickly as we can , you know .
And there ’ s a reason for that : we want to settle on an answer .
Life ’ s complicated ; we want to figure out what ’ s going on around us very quickly .
I suspect , actually , that the evolutionary biologists probably have lots of reasons &#91; for &#93; why we want to categorize new things very , very quickly .
One of them might be , you know , when we see this funny stripy thing : is that a tiger just about to jump out and kill us ?
Or is it just some weird shadows on the tree ?
We need to figure that out pretty fast .
Well , at least , we did once .
Most of us don ’ t need to anymore , I suppose .
This is some aluminum foil , right ? You use it in the kitchen .
That ’ s what it is , isn ’ t it ? Of course it is , of course it is .
Well , not necessarily .
( Laughter ) Kids are more engaged with open possibilities .
Now , they ’ ll certainly — when they come across something new , they ’ ll certainly ask , &quot; &quot; What is it ? &quot; &quot; Of course they will . But they ’ ll also ask , &quot; &quot; What can I do with it ? &quot; &quot; And you know , the more creative of them might get to a really interesting example .
And this openness is the beginning of exploratory play .
Any parents of young kids in the audience ? There must be some .
Yeah , thought so . So we ’ ve all seen it , haven ’ t we ?
We ’ ve all told stories about how , on Christmas morning , our kids end up playing with the boxes far more than they play with the toys that are inside them .
And you know , from an exploration perspective , this behavior makes complete sense .
Because you can do a lot more with boxes than you can do with a toy .
Even one like , say , Tickle Me Elmo — which , despite its ingenuity , really only does one thing , whereas boxes offer an infinite number of choices .
So again , this is another one of those playful activities that , as we get older , we tend to forget and we have to relearn .
So another one of Bob McKim ’ s favorite exercises is called the &quot; &quot; 30 Circles Test . &quot; &quot; So we ’ re back to work . You guys are going to get back to work again .
Turn that piece of paper that you did the sketch on back over , and you ’ ll find those 30 circles printed on the piece of paper .
So it should look like this . You should be looking at something like this .
So what I ’ m going to do is , I ’ m going to give you minute , and I want you to adapt as many of those circles as you can into objects of some form .
So for example , you could turn one into a football , or another one into a sun . All I ’ m interested in is quantity .
I want you to do as many of them as you can , in the minute that I ’ m just about to give you .
So , everybody ready ? OK ? Off you go .
Okay . Put down your pencils , as they say .
So , who got more than five circles figured out ?
Hopefully everybody ? More than 10 ?
Keep your hands up if you did 10 .
15 ? 20 ? Anybody get all 30 ?
No ? Oh ! Somebody did . Fantastic .
Did anybody to a variation on a theme ? Like a smiley face ?
Happy face ? Sad face ? Sleepy face ? Anybody do that ?
Anybody use my examples ? The sun and the football ?
Great . Cool . So I was really interested in quantity .
I wasn ’ t actually very interested in whether they were all different .
I just wanted you to fill in as many circles as possible .
And one of the things we tend to do as adults , again , is we edit things .
We stop ourselves from doing things .
We self-edit as we ’ re having ideas .
And in some cases , our desire to be original is actually a form of editing .
And that actually isn ’ t necessarily really playful .
So that ability just to go for it and explore lots of things , even if they don ’ t seem that different from each other , is actually something that kids do well , and it is a form of play .
So now , Bob McKim did another version of this test in a rather famous experiment that was done in the 1960s .
Anybody know what this is ? It ’ s the peyote cactus .
It ’ s the plant from which you can create mescaline , one of the psychedelic drugs .
For those of you around in the &apos; 60s , you probably know it well .
McKim published a paper in 1966 , describing an experiment that he and his colleagues conducted to test the effects of psychedelic drugs on creativity .
So he picked 27 professionals — they were engineers , physicists , mathematicians , architects , furniture designers even , artists — and he asked them to come along one evening , and to bring a problem with them that they were working on .
He gave each of them some mescaline , and had them listen to some nice , relaxing music for a while .
And then he did what ’ s called the Purdue Creativity Test .
You might know it as , &quot; &quot; How many uses can you find for a paper clip ? &quot; &quot; It ’ s basically the same thing as the 30 circles thing that I just had you do .
Now , actually , he gave the test before the drugs and after the drugs , to see what the difference was in people ’ s facility and speed with coming up with ideas .
And then he asked them to go away and work on those problems that they ’ d brought .
And they ’ d come up with a bunch of interesting solutions — and actually , quite valid solutions — to the things that they ’ d been working on .
And so , some of the things that they figured out , some of these individuals figured out ; in one case , a new commercial building and designs for houses that were accepted by clients ; a design of a solar space probe experiment ; a redesign of the linear electron accelerator ; an engineering improvement to a magnetic tape recorder — you can tell this is a while ago ; the completion of a line of furniture ; and even a new conceptual model of the photon .
So it was a pretty successful evening .
In fact , maybe this experiment was the reason that Silicon Valley got off to its great start with innovation .
We don ’ t know , but it may be .
We need to ask some of the CEOs whether they were involved in this mescaline experiment .
But really , it wasn ’ t the drugs that were important ; it was this idea that what the drugs did would help shock people out of their normal way of thinking , and getting them to forget the adult behaviors that were getting in the way of their ideas .
But it ’ s hard to break our habits , our adult habits .
At IDEO we have brainstorming rules written on the walls .
Edicts like , &quot; &quot; Defer judgment , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Go for quantity . &quot; &quot; And somehow that seems wrong .
I mean , can you have rules about creativity ?
Well , it sort of turns out that we need rules to help us break the old rules and norms that otherwise we might bring to the creative process .
And we ’ ve certainly learnt that over time , you get much better brainstorming , much more creative outcomes when everybody does play by the rules .
Now , of course , many designers , many individual designers , achieve this is in a much more organic way .
I think the Eameses are wonderful examples of experimentation .
And they experimented with plywood for many years without necessarily having one single goal in mind .
They were exploring following what was interesting to them .
They went from designing splints for wounded soldiers coming out of World War II and the Korean War , I think , and from this experiment they moved on to chairs .
Through constant experimentation with materials , they developed a wide range of iconic solutions that we know today , eventually resulting in , of course , the legendary lounge chair .
Now , if the Eameses had stopped with that first great solution , then we wouldn ’ t be the beneficiaries of so many wonderful designs today .
And of course , they used experimentation in all aspects of their work , from films to buildings , from games to graphics .
So , they ’ re great examples , I think , of exploration and experimentation in design .
Now , while the Eameses were exploring those possibilities , they were also exploring physical objects .
And they were doing that through building prototypes .
And building is the next of the behaviors that I thought I ’ d talk about .
So the average Western first-grader spends as much as 50 percent of their play time taking part in what ’ s called &quot; &quot; construction play . &quot; &quot; Construction play — it ’ s playful , obviously , but also a powerful way to learn .
When play is about building a tower out of blocks , the kid begins to learn a lot about towers .
And as they repeatedly knock it down and start again , learning is happening as a sort of by-product of play .
It ’ s classically learning by doing .
Now , David Kelley calls this behavior , when it ’ s carried out by designers , &quot; &quot; thinking with your hands . &quot; &quot; And it typically involves making multiple , low-resolution prototypes very quickly , often by bringing lots of found elements together in order to get to a solution .
On one of his earliest projects , the team was kind of stuck , and they came up with a mechanism by hacking together a prototype made from a roll-on deodorant .
Now , that became the first commercial computer mouse for the Apple Lisa and the Macintosh .
So , they learned their way to that by building prototypes .
Another example is a group of designers who were working on a surgical instrument with some surgeons .
They were meeting with them ; they were talking to the surgeons about what it was they needed with this device .
And one of the designers ran out of the room and grabbed a white board marker and a film canister — which is now becoming a very precious prototyping medium — and a clothespin . He taped them all together , ran back into the room and said , &quot; &quot; You mean , something like this ? &quot; &quot; And the surgeons grabbed hold of it and said , well , I want to hold it like this , or like that .
And all of a sudden a productive conversation was happening about design around a tangible object .
And in the end it turned into a real device .
And so this behavior is all about quickly getting something into the real world , and having your thinking advanced as a result .
At IDEO there ’ s a kind of a back-to-preschool feel sometimes about the environment .
The prototyping carts , filled with colored paper and Play-Doh and glue sticks and stuff — I mean , they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them .
But the important idea is that everything ’ s at hand , everything ’ s around .
So when designers are working on ideas , they can start building stuff whenever they want .
They don ’ t necessarily even have to go into some kind of formal workshop to do it .
And we think that ’ s pretty important .
And then the sad thing is , although preschools are full of this kind of stuff , as kids go through the school system it all gets taken away .
They lose this stuff that facilitates this sort of playful and building mode of thinking .
And of course , by the time you get to the average workplace , maybe the best construction tool we have might be the Post-it notes . It ’ s pretty barren .
But by giving project teams and the clients who they ’ re working with permission to think with their hands , quite complex ideas can spring into life and go right through to execution much more easily .
This is a nurse using a very simple — as you can see — plasticine prototype , explaining what she wants out of a portable information system to a team of technologists and designers that are working with her in a hospital .
And just having this very simple prototype allows her to talk about what she wants in a much more powerful way .
And of course , by building quick prototypes , we can get out and test our ideas with consumers and users much more quickly than if we ’ re trying to describe them through words .
But what about designing something that isn ’ t physical ?
Something like a service or an experience ?
Something that exists as a series of interactions over time ?
Instead of building play , this can be approached with role-play .
So , if you ’ re designing an interaction between two people — such as , I don ’ t know — ordering food at a fast food joint or something , you need to be able to imagine how that experience might feel over a period of time .
And I think the best way to achieve that , and get a feeling for any flaws in your design , is to act it out .
So we do quite a lot of work at IDEO trying to convince our clients of this .
They can be a little skeptical ; I ’ ll come back to that .
But a place , I think , where the effort is really worthwhile is where people are wrestling with quite serious problems — things like education or security or finance or health .
And this is another example in a healthcare environment of some doctors and some nurses and designers acting out a service scenario around patient care .
But you know , many adults are pretty reluctant to engage with role-play .
Some of it ’ s embarrassment and some of it is because they just don ’ t believe that what emerges is necessarily valid .
They dismiss an interesting interaction by saying , you know , &quot; &quot; That ’ s just happening because they ’ re acting it out . &quot; &quot; Research into kids &apos; behavior actually suggests that it ’ s worth taking role-playing seriously .
Because when children play a role , they actually follow social scripts quite closely that they ’ ve learnt from us as adults .
If one kid plays &quot; &quot; store , &quot; &quot; and another one ’ s playing &quot; &quot; house , &quot; &quot; then the whole kind of play falls down .
So they get used to quite quickly to understanding the rules for social interactions , and are actually quite quick to point out when they ’ re broken .
So when , as adults , we role-play , then we have a huge set of these scripts already internalized .
We ’ ve gone through lots of experiences in life , and they provide a strong intuition as to whether an interaction is going to work .
So we ’ re very good , when acting out a solution , at spotting whether something lacks authenticity .
So role-play is actually , I think , quite valuable when it comes to thinking about experiences .
Another way for us , as designers , to explore role-play is to put ourselves through an experience which we ’ re designing for , and project ourselves into an experience .
So here are some designers who are trying to understand what it might feel like to sleep in a confined space on an airplane .
And so they grabbed some very simple materials , you can see , and did this role-play , this kind of very crude role-play , just to get a sense of what it would be like for passengers if they were stuck in quite small places on airplanes .
This is one of our designers , Kristian Simsarian , and he ’ s putting himself through the experience of being an ER patient .
Now , this is a real hospital , in a real emergency room .
One of the reasons he chose to take this rather large video camera with him was because he didn ’ t want the doctors and nurses thinking he was actually sick , and sticking something into him that he was going to regret later .
So anyhow , he went there with his video camera , and it ’ s kind of interesting to see what he brought back .
Because when we looked at the video when he got back , we saw 20 minutes of this .
( Laughter ) And also , the amazing thing about this video — as soon as you see it you immediately project yourself into that experience .
And you know what it feels like : all of that uncertainty while you ’ re left out in the hallway while the docs are dealing with some more urgent case in one of the emergency rooms , wondering what the heck ’ s going on .
And so this notion of using role-play — or in this case , living through the experience as a way of creating empathy — particularly when you use video , is really powerful .
Or another one of our designers , Altay Sendil : he ’ s here having his chest waxed , not because he ’ s very vain , although actually he is — no , I ’ m kidding — but in order to empathize with the pain that chronic care patients go through when they ’ re having dressings removed .
And so sometimes these analogous experiences , analogous role-play , can also be quite valuable .
So when a kid dresses up as a firefighter , you know , he ’ s beginning to try on that identity .
He wants to know what it feels like to be a firefighter .
We ’ re doing the same thing as designers .
We ’ re trying on these experiences .
And so the idea of role-play is both as an empathy tool , as well as a tool for prototyping experiences .
And you know , we kind of admire people who do this at IDEO anyway .
Not just because they lead to insights about the experience , but also because of their willingness to explore and their ability to unselfconsciously surrender themselves to the experience .
In short , we admire their willingness to play .
Playful exploration , playful building and role-play : those are some of the ways that designers use play in their work .
And so far , I admit , this might feel like it ’ s a message just to go out and play like a kid .
And to certain extent it is , but I want to stress a couple of points .
The first thing to remember is that play is not anarchy .
Play has rules , especially when it ’ s group play .
When kids play tea party , or they play cops and robbers , they ’ re following a script that they ’ ve agreed to .
And it ’ s this code negotiation that leads to productive play .
So , remember the sketching task we did at the beginning ?
The kind of little face , the portrait you did ?
Well , imagine if you did the same task with friends while you were drinking in a pub .
But everybody agreed to play a game where the worst sketch artist bought the next round of drinks .
That framework of rules would have turned an embarrassing , difficult situation into a fun game .
As a result , we ’ d all feel perfectly secure and have a good time — but because we all understood the rules and we agreed on them together .
But there aren ’ t just rules about how to play ; there are rules about when to play .
Kids don ’ t play all the time , obviously .
They transition in and out of it , and good teachers spend a lot of time thinking about how to move kids through these experiences .
As designers , we need to be able to transition in and out of play also .
And if we ’ re running design studios we need to be able to figure out , how can we transition designers through these different experiences ?
I think this is particularly true if we think about the sort of — I think what ’ s very different about design is that we go through these two very distinctive modes of operation .
We go through a sort of generative mode , where we ’ re exploring many ideas ; and then we come back together again , and come back looking for that solution , and developing that solution .
I think they ’ re two quite different modes : divergence and convergence .
And I think it ’ s probably in the divergent mode that we most need playfulness .
Perhaps in convergent mode we need to be more serious .
And so being able to move between those modes is really quite important . So , it ’ s where there ’ s a more nuanced version view of play , I think , is required .
Because it ’ s very easy to fall into the trap that these states are absolute .
You ’ re either playful or you ’ re serious , and you can ’ t be both .
But that ’ s not really true : you can be a serious professional adult and , at times , be playful .
It ’ s not an either / or ; it ’ s an &quot; &quot; and . &quot; &quot; You can be serious and play .
So to sum it up , we need trust to play , and we need trust to be creative . So , there ’ s a connection .
And there are a series of behaviors that we ’ ve learnt as kids , and that turn out to be quite useful to us as designers .
They include exploration , which is about going for quantity ; building , and thinking with your hands ; and role-play , where acting it out helps us both to have more empathy for the situations in which we ’ re designing , and to create services and experiences that are seamless and authentic .
Thank you very much . ( Applause )
The Highline is an old , elevated rail line that runs for a mile and a half right through Manhattan .
And it was originally a freight line that ran down 10th Ave .
And it became known as &quot; &quot; Death Avenue &quot; &quot; because so many people were run over by the trains that the railroad hired a guy on horseback to run in front , and he became known as the &quot; &quot; West Side Cowboy . &quot; &quot; But even with a cowboy , about one person a month was killed and run over .
So they elevated it .
They built it 30 ft. in the air , right through the middle of the city .
But with the rise of interstate trucking , it was used less and less .
And by 1980 , the last train rode .
It was a train loaded with frozen turkeys — they say , at Thanksgiving — from the meatpacking district .
And then it was abandoned .
And I live in the neighborhood , and I first read about it in the New York Times , in an article that said it was going to be demolished .
And I assumed someone was working to preserve it or save it and I could volunteer , but I realized no one was doing anything .
I went to my first community board meeting — which I &apos;d never been to one before — and sat next to another guy named Joshua David , who &apos;s a travel writer .
And at the end of the meeting , we realized we were the only two people that were sort of interested in the project ; most people wanted to tear it down .
So we exchanged business cards , and we kept calling each other and decided to start this organization , Friends of the High Line .
And the goal at first was just saving it from demolition , but then we also wanted to figure out what we could do with it .
And what first attracted me , or interested me , was this view from the street — which is this steel structure , sort of rusty , this industrial relic .
But when I went up on top , it was a mile and a half of wildflowers running right through the middle of Manhattan with views of the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty and the Hudson River .
And that &apos;s really where we started , the idea coalesced around , let &apos;s make this a park , and let &apos;s have it be sort of inspired by this wildscape .
At the time , there was a lot of opposition .
Mayor Giuliani wanted to tear it down .
I &apos;m going to fast-forward through a lot of lawsuits and a lot of community engagement .
Mayor Bloomberg came in office , he was very supportive , but we still had to make the economic case .
This was after 9 / 11 ; the city was in tough times .
So we commissioned an economic feasibility study to try to make the case .
And it turns out , we got those numbers wrong .
We thought it would cost 100 million dollars to build .
So far it &apos;s cost about 150 million .
And the main case was , this is going to make good economic sense for the city .
So we said over a 20-year time period , the value to the city in increased property values and increased taxes would be about 250 million .
That was enough . It really got the city behind it .
It turns out we were wrong on that .
Now people estimate it &apos;s created about a half a billion dollars , or will create about a half a billion dollars , in tax revenues for the city .
We did a design competition , selected a design team .
We worked with them to really create a design that was inspired by that wildscape .
There &apos;s three sections .
We opened the fist section in 2009 .
It &apos;s been successful beyond our dreams .
Last year we had about two million people , which is about 10 times what we ever estimated .
This is one of my favorite features in section one .
It &apos;s this amphitheater right over 10th Ave .
And the first section ends at 20th St. right now .
The other thing , it &apos;s generated , obviously , a lot of economic value ; it &apos;s also inspired , I think , a lot of great architecture .
There &apos;s a point , you can stand here and see buildings by Frank Gehry , Jean Nouvel , Shigeru Ban , Neil Denari .
And the Whitney is moving downtown and is building their new museum right at the base of the High Line .
And this has been designed by Renzo Piano .
And they &apos;re going to break ground in May .
And we &apos;ve already started construction on section two .
This is one of my favorite features , this flyover where you &apos;re eight feet off the surface of the High Line , running through a canopy of trees .
The High Line used to be covered in billboards , and so we &apos;ve taken a playful take where , instead of framing advertisements , it &apos;s going to frame people in views of the city .
This was just installed last month .
And then the last section was going to go around the rail yards , which is the largest undeveloped site in Manhattan .
And the city has planned — for better or for worse — 12 million square-feet of development that the High Line is going to ring around .
But what really , I think , makes the High Line special is the people .
And honestly , even though I love the designs that we were building , I was always frightened that I wouldn &apos;t really love it , because I fell in love with that wildscape — and how could you recreate that magic ?
But what I found is it &apos;s in the people and how they use it that , to me , makes it so special .
Just one quick example is I realized right after we opened that there were all these people holding hands on the High Line .
And I realized New Yorkers don &apos;t hold hands ; we just don &apos;t do that outside .
But you see that happening on the High Line , and I think that &apos;s the power that public space can have to transform how people experience their city and interact with each other .
Thanks .

When I arrived in Kiev , on February 1 this year , Independence Square was under siege , surrounded by police loyal to the government .
In response , tens of thousands of dissatisfied citizens poured into central Kiev to demonstrate against this allegiance .
As the months passed , confrontations between police and civilians intensified .
I set up a makeshift portrait studio by the barricades on Hrushevsky Street .
In order to tell the individual human stories here , I felt that I needed to remove the dramatic visuals that had become so familiar and repetitive within the mainstream media .
What I was witnessing was not only news , but also history .
Oleg , Vasiliy and Maxim were all ordinary men , with ordinary lives from ordinary towns .
They were improvised uniforms made up of decommissioned military equipment , irregular combat fatigues and trophies taken from the police .
It gives me time to speak with each person and to look at them , in silence , while they look back at me .
Rising tensions culminated in the worst day of violence on February 20 , which became known as Bloody Thursday .
Snipers , loyal to the government , started firing on the civilians and protesters on Institutskaya Street .
Many were killed in a very short space of time .
The reception of the Hotel Ukraine became a makeshift morgue .
There were lines of bodies laid in the street .
And there was blood all over the pavements .
The following day , President Yanukovych fled Ukraine .
History unfolded quickly , but celebration remained elusive in Maidan .
Many were women who often carried flowers that they had brought to lay as marks of respect for the dead .
They came day after day and they covered the square with millions of flowers .
Sadness enveloped Maidan .
It was quiet and I could hear the birds singing .
I hadn &apos;t heard that before .
Most women cried when I photographed them .
There had been such a noticeable absence of women up until that point .
And the color of their pastel coats , their shiny handbags , and the bunches of red carnations , white tulips and yellow roses that they carried jarred with the blackened square and the blackened men who were encamped there .
It is clear to me that these two sets of pictures don &apos;t make much sense without the other .
They are about men and women and the way we are — not the way we look , but the way we are .
They speak about different gender roles in conflict , not only in Maidan , and not only in Ukraine .
Men fight most wars and women mourn them .
If the men showed the ideal of the warrior , then the women showed the implications of such violence .
When I made these pictures , I believed that I was documenting the end of violent events in Ukraine .
But now I understand that it is a record of the beginning .
Today , the death toll stands around 3,000 , while hundreds of thousands have been displaced .
I was in Ukraine again six weeks ago .
In Maidan , the barricades have been dismantled , and the paving stones which were used as weapons during the protests replaced , so that traffic flows freely through the center of the square .
The fighters , the women and the flowers are gone .
Glory to heroes . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
